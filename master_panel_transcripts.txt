Your unknown co-author is quite wise.

Hello, watch.
What time is is?
This is the anthropocene epoch.
************
2014-12-05c.gif
Wow, that carbon dates me.
************
2014-12-04a.gif
All I need is my flip phone, my Windows XP, and my basic cable television.
************
2014-12-04b.gif
Did I sound like a big, dumb dinosaur that time?
************
2014-12-04c.gif
Pretty much.
Wow... there is no cool way to describe my life.
************
2014-12-03a.gif
I don't own a smartphone.
I use a flip phone because it does everything I want.
************
2014-12-03b.gif
Why are you proud of being a big, dumb dinosaur with a terrible phone?
************
2014-12-03c.gif
I'm sensing a lot of judgement in that question.
Wait until  you hear my follow-ups.
************
2014-12-02a.gif
Do you want some constructive criticism?
************
2014-12-02b.gif
No, but I would love some under-informed opinions about things you don't understand.
************
2014-12-02c.gif

I couldn't open the document you sent with your project update.

2014-12-01b.gif
Try erasing your hard disk and reinstalling the operating system.
************
2014-12-01c.gif
I guess I don't need it that badly.
After all the work I put into making that document?

2014-11-29a.gif
I feel so rested and relaxed after my vacation.
************
2014-11-29b.gif

2014-11-29c.gif
Is it too late to start timing it?

2014-11-28a.gif
Let's skip to the part where I tell you how you should have engineered it instead of whatever you did.
************
2014-11-28b.gif
You don't know what I did.
************
2014-11-28c.gif
I have five minutes to pretend that matters.
That's all I need.
************
2014-11-27a.gif
If our business plan fails, do we have a plan for that?
************
2014-11-27b.gif
Only losers plan for failure.
************
2014-11-27c.gif
I think we're on the same page, but for some reason you're angry about it.
************
2014-11-26a.gif
Are you going to meet the launch deadline?
No.
************
2014-11-26b.gif
I need solutions, not unexpected problems!
I need solutions, not unexpected problems!
************
2014-11-26c.gif
Did that mean anything?
Almost.
Good try.
************
2014-11-25a.gif
And I plan to launch the beta version in two months.
************
2014-11-25b.gif
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
************
2014-11-25c.gif
I have a credibility problem.
And I should believe that?
************
2014-11-24a.gif
The good news is that we had the winning bid for the project.
************
2014-11-24b.gif
The less-good news is that we don't make the product we just sold, nor could we make it for the price we bid.
************
2014-11-24c.gif
My plan is to put out an RFP to secretly subcontract the work to a bigger liar.
That could work.
************
2014-11-22a.gif
I'm hitting a snag with this RFP because our products don't do what they need.
************
2014-11-22b.gif
Should I give up and accept failure or lie about our features and transfer the problem to them?
************
2014-11-22c.gif
My daddy used to say it isn't a problem if you can give it to someone else.
Then he drove you to school?
************
2014-11-21a.gif
Good news!
I got rehired as CEO!
************
2014-11-21b.gif
I checked the security videos for the day I got fired, and not I'm getting revenge on anyone who did a happy dance.
************
2014-11-21c.gif
Did I...?
Frankly, I can't tell.
Do you have spasms?
************
2014-11-20a.gif
The board has approved a $100 million golden parachute if you quit now.
************
2014-11-20b.gif
$100 million?!!!
How am I supposed to live on that?
You insult me!
************
2014-11-20c.gif
That's a lot of money for doing nothing.
Bah!
I spend more than that on soft cheese.
************
2014-11-19a.gif
I will give you 10% of my annual pay if you do 100% of my job for me.
I'll give you 10% of what he's paying me if you do 100% of his work plus mine.
************
2014-11-19b.gif
10% of my pay as CEO is still a lot of money.
It's still a lot of money.
I'll do it.
************
2014-11-19c.gif
10% of my pay as CEO is still a lot of money.

2014-11-18a.gif
I have bad news.
Dogbert the Co-CEO.

2014-11-18b.gif
Your Co-CEO died trying to kitesurf some class 6 rapids for a publicity stunt.
************
2014-11-18c.gif
Get to the bad part.
Is it margins?
************
2014-11-17a.gif
Let's split the duties this way...
************
2014-11-17b.gif
I will be the CEO who attends boring meetings, and you can be more of a Richard Branson type who does dangerous publicity stunts.
************
2014-11-17c.gif
Co-CEO: I love that idea.
And then there was one.
************
2014-11-15a.gif
I hired a co-CEO, but it isn't working because we disagree on everything.
************
2014-11-15b.gif
We want to hire you as our third CEO so we always have a tiebreaker.
************
2014-11-15c.gif
I accept.
The new guy and I have decided to fire you and split the CEO spot two ways.
************
2014-11-14a.gif
I decided to hire a co-CEO to share the job with me.
************
2014-11-14b.gif
I assume you know that having a co-CEO does not mean you get paid the same while working half as much.
************
2014-11-14c.gif
Can I fire you?
Co-CEO: No, we need a third CEO to break the tie.
************
2014-11-13a.gif
I need you to organize some sort of memorial thing for Fred.
You mean Ted.
************
2014-11-13b.gif
I'm thinking cake and balloons in the break room.
************
2014-11-13c.gif
Is that tasteful enough?
I could hire a mime to pretend he's in an invisible box.
************
2014-11-12a.gif
We mourn the untimely passing of our beloved colleague, Fred.
************
2014-11-12b.gif
It was Ted, not Fred.
************
2014-11-12c.gif
Was he beloved?
I don't remember.
It was like a week ago.
************
2014-11-11a.gif
Ted retired yesterday and dropped dead this morning.
************
2014-11-11b.gif
You worked him to death with perfect timing.
************
2014-11-11c.gif
If I'm being honest, hitting the exact day was just luck.
************
2014-11-10a.gif
We can only succeed if we work harder than our competitors!
************
2014-11-10b.gif
Oops, gotta go.
My helicopter is here to take me to my massage appointment on my superyacht.
************
2014-11-10c.gif
Stop staring at me.
I only have to work harder than other CEOs.
************
2014-11-08a.gif
Is it my imagination or is there no career path here from intern to anything else?
************
2014-11-08b.gif
Catbert: If we promote you, we just have to find another intern.
No one wins in that scenario.
************
2014-11-08c.gif
Actually, I would be the winner in that scenario.
I've never thought of it that way and I don't like it.
************
2014-11-07a.gif
Egyptian pharaohs killed the engineers who build their pyramids so they would never share their secrets.
************
2014-11-07b.gif
I don't think they did.
************
2014-11-07c.gif
Can we reschedule this meeting until I find a historically accurate explanation of our new policy?
************
2014-11-06a.gif
I discovered a unique sequence of sights and sounds that makes people buy things they don't need.
************
2014-11-06b.gif
I recommend that we destroy all of my lab notes and rid the world of this evil tool.
************
2014-11-06c.gif
You never told him what marketing is?
He didn't need to know.
************
2014-11-05a.gif
Our sales dropped to zero because you told the media we have a better product coming soon.
************
2014-11-05b.gif
And 95% of the staff resigned because you announced plans to fire 50% of them.
************
2014-11-05c.gif
Maybe it would be better if you never spoke to anyone again.
How would people get my wisdom.
************
2014-11-04a.gif
Our sales for the quarter are zero.
************
2014-11-04b.gif
Because I might have mentioned on CNBC that we have a better, cheaper model coming soon.
************
2014-11-04c.gif
So... great job on the new product... and I need to fire half of you so it looks as if I do things.
What is your home address?
************
2014-11-03a.gif
I am Phil, The Prince of Insufficient Light.
I got a report that you wished bad karma upon your co-workers.
************
2014-11-03b.gif
You would put off a more menacing vibe if you didn't have leftover cereal in your pitchspoon.
************
2014-11-03c.gif
I was really hungry and I didn't feel like emptying the dishwasher.
We've all been there.
************
2014-11-01a.gif
I would like to thank each of you for playing with your phones and not listening to a word I said all meeting.
************
2014-11-01b.gif
I hope karma is a real thing and frozen lavatory debris from airplanes kills each of you.
************
2014-11-01c.gif
What was he going on about?
Beats me.
I'm not much of a multitasker.
************
2014-10-31a.gif
Can you answer some questions about our product prototype?
************
2014-10-31b.gif
No, but I would be happy to strangle you with your own lanyard and put your corpse in my boss' Escalade to frame him for the crime.
************
2014-10-31c.gif
That scenario is alarmingly specific.
For this sort of thing, premeditated is the way to go.
************
2014-10-30a.gif
Put together a deck showing the minimum viable product feature list.
************
2014-10-30b.gif
What is a deck?
What is a minimum viable product?
How would I know what the features are?
************
2014-10-30c.gif
I have no respect for people who ask questions.
************
2014-10-29a.gif
I'm trying to turn myself into a morning person so I can be more productive.
************
2014-10-29b.gif
I've been getting up at 4:30 every day, and so far, so good.
************
2014-10-29c.gif
So... no problems at all?
Nothing huge.
************
2014-10-28a.gif
Three months.
That's how long I have been waiting for you to do your part of the project.
************
2014-10-28b.gif
Perhaps you don't realize how many projects I'm on.
************
2014-10-28c.gif
Have you done any work for the other projects?
That would defeat the point of having multiple projects.
************
2014-10-27a.gif
I'll do some A-B testing with the design options you provided.
************
2014-10-27b.gif
Interestingly, the fact that you can't predict which design will perform best means your skill set is mostly random behavior that you package as talent.
************
2014-10-27c.gif
This works better if i'm the only one who knows that.
************
2014-10-25a.gif
Dilbert, meet our new graphic designer.
************
2014-10-25b.gif
If I had your job, I would secretly sub it out to strangers on the Internet and pay them 5% of my salary while I did nothing all day.
************
2014-10-25c.gif
Oops, sorry.
I didn't know you were already there.
************
2014-10-24a.gif
The new business school rankings are out.
************
2014-10-24b.gif
Is that the list that is based on the votes of people who have no direct knowledge of those schools?
************
2014-10-24c.gif
You ruin everything.
Context is not your friend.
************
2014-10-23a.gif
I met with that angel investor at his house and he answered the door pantsless and drunk.
************
2014-10-23b.gif
So I snapped a few photos with my phone and secured a million-dollar seed investment.
************
2014-10-23c.gif
Was that wrong?
Let's call it a tie.
************
2014-10-22a.gif
An angel investor agreed to meet with me about my start-up idea.
************
2014-10-22b.gif
You need to be careful because he might be...
We're meeting for drinks at his house on Saturday night.
************
2014-10-22c.gif
I'm socially inept and even I know that sounds wrong.
He keeps texting to say he can't wait to fund me.
************
2014-10-21a.gif
Did you have any problems filling in for me while I was on vacation?
************
2014-10-21b.gif
It was hard at first.
I couldn't tell who was lying about doing a spectacular job.
************
2014-10-21c.gif
That's why I reward them randomly.
I tried that and it did seem to settle them down.
************
2014-10-20a.gif
Is it just my simulated imagination or are all of the employees lying to me all the time?
************
2014-10-20b.gif
We trained them to be that way by punishing honesty.
************
2014-10-20c.gif
How is you project coming along?
100% perfect!
Couldn't be better!
************
2014-10-18a.gif
My sensors detect no work coming from this cubicle.
************
2014-10-18b.gif
That's because I have been working on an engineering problem in my head for five years.
************
2014-10-18c.gif
I was, but you just made me forget all of it.
Are you almost done?
************
2014-10-17a.gif
I have come to micromanage you.
************
2014-10-17b.gif
But only until I replace you with a robot and turn you into furniture.
************
2014-10-17c.gif
On the plus side, he has a plan and he communicates well.
************
2014-10-16a.gif
Our robot will be sitting in for me while I'm on vacation.
************
2014-10-16b.gif
I hope you can get used to taking orders from a soulless creature of questionable intelligence.
************
2014-10-16c.gif
I think I can do that.
Boss: That's the spirit!
************
2014-10-15a.gif
You two have failed to meet your project milestones.
************
2014-10-15b.gif
That's because you paired me with a toxic moron who is incapable of having an original thought.
************
2014-10-15c.gif
That happened to me, too.
************
2014-10-14a.gif
Hey, it's the first day of our new dress code and we wore exactly the same outfits!
************
2014-10-14b.gif
If you ever say that again I will rip out your tongue and use it to slap you to death.
************
2014-10-14c.gif
Is it because I wore it better?
************
2014-10-13a.gif
This is our new company dress code.
We call it "Business Dorky."
************
2014-10-13b.gif
I like it because it makes you look powerless, boring, and sexually irrelevant.
************
2014-10-13c.gif
They make me wear this badge so I don't look like an asexual trespasser.
Accessories make the outfit.
************
2014-10-11a.gif

2014-10-11b.gif

2014-10-11c.gif
So... business casual?
That's a dumb name for it.

2014-10-10a.gif
Did you see the article on the Internet about the five signs you might be a bad boss?
************
2014-10-10b.gif
Yeah.

2014-10-10c.gif
That was number three on the list.
I didn't read it.
That was number one.

2014-10-09a.gif
I'm getting complaints that you've been trash-talking employees' families so they'll spend more time at work.
************
2014-10-09b.gif
I stopped by to give you a high-five from Human Resources.
************
2014-10-09c.gif
Your aim is terrible.
The first one was practice~
************
2014-10-08a.gif
Carol, I know it isn't easy balancing your work duties and your family.
************
2014-10-08b.gif
So I thought it would help if I trash-talk your family.
That way you won't feel so guilty when you ignore them to do my busywork.
************
2014-10-08c.gif
I'll start with your husband.
Don't bother.
I got that one covered.
************
2014-10-07a.gif
They say curiosity is a sign of a nimble intellect.
************
2014-10-07b.gif
Curiosity killed the cat.

2014-10-07c.gif
That evidence was anecdotal, but I still found it compelling.

2014-10-06a.gif
My neck is killing me.
I must have slept wrong.

2014-10-06b.gif
Ha ha ha!
You can't even sleep right!

2014-10-06c.gif
I'm doing you a favor because laughter is the best medicine.
Why does that no longer sound wise?!

2014-10-04a.gif
I'm pretending to be a workaholic so the company will pay for rehab.

2014-10-04b.gif
I am working too hard!
It is starting to affect my health!

2014-10-04c.gif
That seemed a bit dramatic.
Here we go with blaming the victim.

2014-10-03a.gif
If I become a workaholic, will the company pay for rehab?
************
2014-10-03b.gif

2014-10-03c.gif
That's what you do now.
At rehab I think they do your laundry for you.

2014-10-02a.gif
I heard a rumor of a reorganization.
Is it true?

2014-10-02b.gif
Who told you that?
Answering a question with a question means yes.

Are you accusing me of being a deceptive weasel?
Who told you that?
Why would you ask that?

2014-10-01a.gif
I can tell a lot from an applicant's storytelling skills.
So tell me a story.

2014-10-01b.gif
Last week, I broke into a morgue and took a selfie with a dead guy.

2014-10-01c.gif
I hired a new salesperson.
************
2014-09-30a.gif
I was hired because I'm a good cultural fit.

2014-09-30b.gif
I hope we can get past the stigma that cultural hires are incompetent.

2014-09-30c.gif
But I don't know how to do that.
Maybe you could ask a competent person to help you.

2014-09-29a.gif
Dilbert, meet Larry.
He isn't terribly competent, but he's a good cultural fit.

2014-09-29b.gif
Hi, Larry.
Thanks for reinforcing our culture of incompetence.

2014-09-29c.gif
You're joking about the incompetence, right.
Sure.

My best ideas are trapped in my head.

2014-09-27c.gif
IS that analogy one of your great ideas?
I don't like the way you asked that.

2014-09-26a.gif
I have too many projects.
I'm freaking out.

2014-09-26b.gif
Experts say you should tackle the most unpleasant tasks first, so you have a feeling of accomplishment and control.
************
2014-09-26c.gif
Now I have too many projects and some extra anxiety that I'm doing them in the wrong order.
Off you go.
************
2014-09-25a.gif
I need your opinion before I make a decision.
************
2014-09-25b.gif
Studies show that if you ask for my opinion, I will no longer perceive you as a leader.
************
2014-09-25c.gif
And if I do not ask for your opinion?
I would perceive you as an idiot and a leader.
************
2014-09-24a.gif
The secret to being a great leader is to zig when others zag.
************
2014-09-24b.gif
Coincidentally, that is the same strategy used by the insane.
************
2014-09-24c.gif
I should fire you for your insubordination.
Or you could zig.

2014-09-23a.gif
No one looks at resumes anymore.
Now we use special algorithms to see where your personality fits in our culture.

2014-09-23b.gif
That process sounds like a steaming pile of stupidity that will beat itself to death in a few years.

2014-09-23c.gif
I'll start you in engineering.
You'll fit right in.

2014-09-22a.gif
Your experience is impressive, but a better predictor of success is your cognitive control.

Yee-ha!

Our CEO has asked each of us to donate 1% of our work time to a charitable cause.

2014-04-28a.gif
I need you to write a business plan for our new line of products.

2014-04-22a.gif
I need an exception to the travel budget freeze so I can fix an important customer's technical problem.

2014-04-22b.gif
No, because arbitrary financial targets are more important than satisfying customers.

2014-04-22c.gif
If it makes you feel better, I wasn't listening.
************
2014-04-21a.gif
The travel budget is frozen so we can meet our income estimates for this quarter.

2014-04-21b.gif
Is that because all business travel is a waste of time or because we no longer care about long-term profitability?

2014-04-21c.gif
Take as long as you need.

But I can't give you a raise because you once had a personal item on your desk.

How are those things equal?!
And here comes the insubordination.

2014-03-28a.gif
I haven't slept since October because the culture of consulting firms is anti-health.

Plantkiller?

2014-03-25c.gif
Give me a hand signal when you're done.
This reminds me of the time I took the stairs.

************
2014-03-22a.gif
Before we start my performance review, I should remind you that it would take three people to replace me.
************
2014-03-22b.gif
And I will resign at the slightest criticism, leaving you with a huge hiring and budget problem.
************
2014-03-22c.gif
This was supposed to make you nervous, not me.
That think is so pre-Google.
************
2014-03-21a.gif
You should let me work at home a few days per week because studies show that telecommuters put in more hours.
************
2014-03-21b.gif
How do they study that sort of thing?
They survey people who work at home.

************
2014-03-14c.gif
That's messed up.
A little.
************
2014-03-13a.gif
I did A-B testing and found the search terms that bring the most people to our site.
************
2014-03-13b.gif
The most effective search terms are "wingless skunk," "junkyard snack," and "planned injury."
************
2014-03-13c.gif
Well, duh!
You could have just asked me.
************
2014-03-12a.gif
I see you have a phone with a tiny screen.

2014-03-12b.gif
That must be embarrassing compared to my enormous phone.

2014-03-12c.gif
Is it expensive?

Da-dee da-dum.

Stick with the green.

Sure.
I feel liberated from the tyranny of thinking.

2014-03-07a.gif
Our experiment with flattened organization failed.

2014-03-07b.gif

No one said the transition would be smooth.
Make the first one count.

2014-03-06c.gif
Now tell me the benefits.
My sciatica no longer hurts.
And my stock portfolio is way up.

2014-03-05a.gif
Now that we're organized as a holacracy, I need to learn how to look busy like the rest of you.
************
2014-03-05b.gif
Try walking into people's cubicles without an invitation and babbling about things they don't care about.
************
2014-03-05c.gif
I should write this down.
************
2014-03-04a.gif
Now that we're organized as a holacracy, I have no idea what I should be doing.
************
2014-03-04b.gif
Holacracy involves dynamic governance, transparent operations, and harnessing your conscious capacity.
************
2014-03-04c.gif
That sounds like "wander around."
Try to do it dynamically.
************
2014-03-03a.gif
I'm eliminating all management levels and making us a holacracy.

2014-03-01a.gif
Studies show that offering customers too many options can prevent them from buying.

2014-03-01b.gif
That doesn't sound like a real thing.
Studies??
************
2014-03-01c.gif
I don't know what to do now.
Maybe that's the problem.
************
2014-02-28a.gif
For some reason, your written goals for last year were "Drink lots of coffee" and "Disrespect authority."
************
2014-02-28b.gif
Maybe next year your goal should be something about reading my goals before you sign them.
************
2014-02-28c.gif
Accomplishing stuff feels good.
You should try it.

2014-02-27a.gif
I'm happy to report that I achieved every goal you set for me last year.
************
2014-02-27b.gif
But you failed to achieve the secret goals I set for you.

2014-02-27c.gif
Why would you have secret goals for me?!
For this exact situation.

2014-02-26a.gif

2014-02-26b.gif
don't.

Our goal is to ship a million units this quarter.
************
2014-02-25b.gif
Do we have any goals that involve making customers happy?

2014-02-25c.gif
I'm talking about our goals, not their goals.
Totally different.

2014-02-22c.gif
Boss; You could kill him with kindness.

2014-02-21a.gif
The secret to having a rewarding work-life balance is to have no life.

Then it's easy to keep things balanced by doing no work.

2014-02-20c.gif
Sure.
Can I make it painful?
Why would you even ask that?
************
2014-02-19a.gif
Cryonics will allow me to preserve my brain until the age of transhumanism so I can live forever in a robot body.

Dilbert, I need a status update on why your last status wasn't updated.

2014-02-19c.gif
Please kill me now.
I don't do favors that can't be repaid.
************
2014-02-18a.gif
I'm training myself to get by on five hours of sleep per night.

2014-02-18b.gif

Not it not be doesn't.
Can I have a thousand percent raise?

2014-02-17a.gif

Your only hope is to kill them in ways that are untraceable.

2014-02-14a.gif
Can I sign up for a workshop on how to deal with difficult co-workers?

2014-02-14b.gif
People will be using those methods against me, and I need to know how to thwart their countermeasures.
************
2014-02-14c.gif
Will you leave my office if I say yes?
Where did you learn that trick?!
************
2014-02-13a.gif
The key to leadership is setting vague goals that are a combination of jargon and wishful thinking.
************
2014-02-13b.gif
That way, I can keep dumping work on you without hearing you whine that it doesn't fit with your goals.
************
2014-02-13c.gif
You have to admit, my system is better than whatever you're doing over there.
Yup.

2014-02-10a.gif
My projects are winding down and I'd like to take on more responsibility.

2014-02-10b.gif
Ooh.
That's a problem because I just finished your performance review and it says you don't take initiative.

2014-02-10c.gif
I guess you need to redo that.
That would be one way to play it.

And that was the easy part...

2014-02-04a.gif
I took your advice to start overeating so I could save all of my willpower for work.
************
2014-02-04b.gif
The only downside is a twenty-year reduction in my life expectancy.
************
2014-02-04c.gif
Are you okay with that?
************
2014-02-03a.gif
Studies say willpower is finite.
If you use it for one thing, you have less for another.
************
2014-02-03b.gif
So if it feels hard to work long hours, without any reward, try eating cake for lunch.

For once, it wasn't all bad.

I can give you more if you do your job of setting priorities for my 27 projects.

Can't you set the priorities?
Sure.
This one just went to 1.7%.

I don't know how to thank you for this.
This didn't go the way I hoped.

2013-01-11a.gif
Studies say employees prefer having a good boss over getting a raise.

2013-01-11b.gif
So instead of giving raises, pretend to be less dysfunctional.
It's cheaper.

You're a creepy little dude.

Yes, the data shows that my productivity plunges whenever you learn new jargon.

Hypothetically, if I had forgotten to mention several features, would that be a problem?

2013-01-05c.gif
I wouldn't expect much out of my first draft.

2013-01-04a.gif
I got a job as a news manufacturer for an online media company.

I quote people out of context, add misleading headlines and tie it all up with a snarky bow.

2013-01-04c.gif
I thought the news occurred naturally.

2013-01-03a.gif
We need to foster more of a start-up culture to drive innovation.

2013-01-03b.gif
So we get to dress casually, work flex hours, feel that our work is valued, and get equity in the company.
************
2013-01-03c.gif
What would be the name of a culture where people work hard but don't get any of those things you just mentioned.

2013-01-02a.gif
A good leader puts his team ahead of his own ego.

2013-01-02b.gif
What do great leaders do?
I'm thinking it's the opposite, right?
************
2013-01-02c.gif
They don't do what you just did.
They don't be awesome?

2013-01-01a.gif
A fresh new year is upon us and I am brimming with optimism.

2013-01-01b.gif
Ugh.
Our network at work is down because my pointy-haired boss wouldn't let me upgrade the software.
Now I need to work all night to fix it.

2013-01-01c.gif
Maybe this means the next 364 days will be extra awesome.

2012-12-31a.gif
Have you seen Wally?
He's been in the men's room for two days.

2012-12-29c.gif
You're over-thinking it.

I've been aggressive recently.
I haven't noticed.

2012-12-28b.gif
I think my testosterone is all jacked up because I won the company's online trivia contest.

2012-12-28c.gif
Okay, I'm starting to see it.
************
2012-12-27a.gif
I got a report that you've been bullying co-workers.
That's dumb.
************
2012-12-27b.gif
I make friendly suggestions about how people could waste less of my time and it looks like bullying.
************
2012-12-27c.gif
Let's schedule a time to talk more about this.
Or-- just a friendly suggestion-- you could not waste my freakin' time.

2012-12-26a.gif
Asok, I need to teach you to be more assertive in meetings.

2012-12-26b.gif
You're a miserable human being and I hope you die in a long, painful way!

2012-12-26c.gif
Dial it back a little.
I hope you die quickly?

Merry Christmas.

2012-12-20b.gif
The long-term goal is to get you to pay us for the privilege of working here.

2012-12-20c.gif
I heard words I didn't know were words.

2012-12-19a.gif
Before I make my decision, I'd like to ask for your opinions.

2012-12-19b.gif
It's supposed to make you feel "engaged."

2012-12-19c.gif
And you actually plan to listen to us?
I'm hoping it will look that way on the outside.

2012-12-18b.gif
He dresses in a bunny costume and he's had seventeen jobs in two years.

Are there any red flags?
I can't tell if he's passionate or if he has rage issues.

Oh, really?
Well, I should hop all over you for saying that!

Did you finish the tasks we talked about in the last meeting?

2012-12-15b.gif
No, because your communication skills are so poor that I had no idea I was supposed to do a task.

2012-12-13a.gif
I don't know if I should focus on my strengths or strengthen my weaknesses.

2012-12-13b.gif
Or should I have a bias for action and not waste time sharpening any of my skills?

2012-12-13c.gif
Which path gets you to do actual work?
I sense a coldness to your mentoring.

2012-12-12a.gif
Some of the most famous geniuses in the world slept only four hours per night.

I'm doing four hours a night too because you know what they say: correlation is the same thing as causation.

I'm a highly trained technical writer.
What makes you think you can do my job better?
************
2012-06-06c.gif
That might be a trick questions, but I'm pretty sure the answer is paragraph two.
************
2012-06-05a.gif
I think I need to be more vocal about my accomplishments.
************
2012-06-05b.gif
I've found that bragging is a perfect substitute for accomplishing stuff.

2012-05-30a.gif
Can you come to my meeting at 8am tomorrow?
No.

2012-05-30b.gif
I reserve the first few hours of every morning for useful work.

2012-05-30c.gif
That feels like an insult.
I call it good time management.
There's a lot of overlap.
************
2012-05-29a.gif
How are you doing in your unspoken objectives?
My what?

2012-05-29b.gif
I'm referring to the goals I have in my mind that I've never mentioned.

I'm totally nailing them.
************
2012-05-28a.gif
Sorry I'm late.
************
2012-05-28b.gif
It's because the least important thing I do is way more important than all of you put together.
************
2012-05-28c.gif
One way to look at it is that I'm great at setting priorities.

Hey, that's a great idea!

Are we too big to fail?
Nope.

2012-05-22b.gif
We're more like two pigs that flail.

Don't worry.

2011-09-13c.gif
So it's sort of a technical problem?
Okay.

2011-09-12a.gif
We can manipulate the pointy-haired menace into picking the right plan by comparing it to the worst alternatives.

Did you read my technical recommendation?
No.
It's too long and complicated.

2011-09-09b.gif
How do you plan to make a decision without reading it?
I'll use my gut.

It's probably a good idea to keep your brain out of this.
Quiet!
It's saying something.

2011-09-07a.gif
I recommend that you buy the Dogbert database software.

Did I just pay a consultant to recommend his own company's software?
I'm totally objective.

2011-09-07c.gif
Who would install and test it?
Maybe a consultant who knows the product?
************
2011-09-06a.gif
Can you work long hours if needed?
Yes.
It's normal for me to work 14 hours a day.
************
2011-09-06b.gif
Research shows that working long hours causes people to make bad decisions.
So we know you're a bad decision maker.
************
2011-09-06c.gif
Are you a good communicator?
Is the right answer "no"?
************
2011-09-05a.gif
Are you creative?
Oh, yes.
I'm very creative.
************
2011-09-05b.gif
Research tells us that creative people take ethical shortcuts and are generally less honest.

2011-07-28a.gif
Wally, you said you'd be finished with the design by now.

2011-07-28b.gif
I said I would start on it by now.
That is not what you said!

All of the numbers I gave you last week are wrong.

2011-07-26b.gif
I would have mentioned it sooner, but I don't like to draw attention to myself.

I recommended option two because neither plan will work but option one is way more expensive.

2011-06-27c.gif
I thought we were doubling the direction.
No, we're doubling the clarity.

2011-06-25a.gif
Oh no!
Employee job satisfaction is at an all-time low at the same time unemployment is high!
Oh no!

That's sort of a loserish thing to say.

************
2011-06-22a.gif
I can't get buy-in for my project because our CEO hasn't approved it.

2011-06-22b.gif
And I can't get our CEO to approve it until I have buy-in from all of the divisions.

Gloating doesn't sound hard.
Can I do it without moving any facial muscles?
************
2011-06-18a.gif

2011-06-18b.gif
No.
Indispensable people end up working too hard because they can't risk showing anyone else how to do what they do.

Being useless seems riskier.
Have you seen the tie clip I got for 20 years of service?

2011-06-17a.gif
I noticed some inefficiencies in another department, so I formed a Kaizen team to find solutions.

I asked some of the peopl in that department to be on the team, but they were busy being inefficient.

2011-06-17c.gif
With any luck, my ignorance of their function will be seen as an aggressive type of objectivity.

2011-06-16a.gif
Wally, have you done anything to address of your project with Ted's project?
************
2011-06-16b.gif
Yes, I've initiated discussions to create a framework that would allow us to adopt complementary architectures.

2011-06-16c.gif
So... nothing.
So... nothing.

Failing 90% of the time is very similar to not trying at all.

But complexity is too abstract for you to manage, so instead you will spray me energy into the vortex of failure.

2009-09-15b.gif

And change our packaging to that hard plastic that always cuts the consumes' hands.
************
2009-09-14c.gif
I've been in a bad mood since everyone started talking about capping my excessive pay.
************
2009-09-12a.gif
I need more resources on my project.
I'll give you someone from Alice's project.
************
2009-09-12b.gif

I can only solve one problem at a time.

Did he solve your problem?
I'm going to say yes.

Robots.

2008-10-27a.gif

2008-10-27c.gif
That's something they don't cover in business school.
************
2008-10-25a.gif
Can you give me some comments on my business plan?
Sure.
************
2008-10-25b.gif
Your plan is a hodge-podge of unwarranted optimism encased in an impenetrable fortress of buzzwords.
************
2008-10-25c.gif
Would you like to read it?
There's that unwarranted optimism again.
************
2008-10-24a.gif
The quality of your graphics casts a dark shadow across all of your work.

2008-10-24c.gif
So... bad graphics... what else?
************
2008-10-23a.gif
Our graphics department made this logo for my project.

2008-10-23b.gif
In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have badgered them to finish quickly.
************
2008-10-23c.gif
Please don't judge my competence by my logo.
Too late.
************
2008-10-22a.gif
Our graphics department is too busy to help me and won't approve outside services.
************
2008-10-22b.gif
They're forcing me to fail so they can justify a bigger budget next year.
************
2008-10-22c.gif
If you need me, I'll be in my cubicle trying to imagine what futility doesn't feel like.
************
2008-10-21a.gif
And I need you to design a logo for our prototype.
************
2008-10-21b.gif
We don't do that.
We're the graphics support department.
Talk to the graphics production department.
************
2008-10-21c.gif
They create logos?
No, they tell people we do it.

2008-10-15c.gif
Or that the parking lot is filling up with beaks and feathers.
I can't please everyone.
************
2008-10-14a.gif
I earn 420 times what you make.
That means I'm 420 times smarter.
************
2008-10-14b.gif
Actually, it means the system is deeply flawed.
************
2008-10-14c.gif
If you were 420 times smarter, you wouldn't be contradicting your boss right now.
************
2008-10-13a.gif
My salary is 400 times more than yours.
************
2008-10-13b.gif
My goal is to jack that up to 410, maybe 420.
************
2008-10-13c.gif
I hate you for this.
So you admit you're selfish?
************
2008-10-11a.gif
We invested $100 million in your solar technology and all you developed was this ham sandwich.

2008-10-11b.gif

2008-10-11c.gif

2008-10-10a.gif

I didn't invent any solar panels.

2008-10-10b.gif

Attention all employees.
The stain is on the move.

I repeat, the stain is on the move.

2008-06-23c.gif
Relaxing just got harder.

2008-06-21a.gif
We monitor all of your actions, but we suspect you are still doing non-work-related thinking.

2008-06-21b.gif
My lab assistant Trixie will attach sensors to your head and track all of your thoughts.
************
2008-06-21c.gif
Engineers.

2008-06-20a.gif
We've installed surveillance cameras to monitor your work.
************
2008-06-20b.gif
It might seem like an unconscionable assault on your privacy, but you'll get used to it.
************
2008-06-20c.gif
I'm already a little bit used to it.
Used to what?
************
2008-06-19a.gif
************
2008-06-19b.gif
People are saying Ted is an exotic male dancer on weekends.
I know it isn't true because he spends all of his free time in a terrorist training camp.
************
2008-06-19c.gif
Isn't that worse?
I get paid per rumor.
It's not a perfect system.
************
2008-06-18a.gif
I need to squash a workplace rumor that I'm an idiot.
************
2008-06-18b.gif
I charge $10 for each false rumor and $1,000 for any rumor I decide is true.
************
2008-06-18c.gif
Sounds fair.
That just cost you $1,000.
Really?
************
2008-06-17a.gif
I heard a rumor that you think a monkey could do my job.
************
2008-06-17b.gif
Do you think a monkey could fling this corporate newsletter at your head?
************
2008-06-17c.gif
Is this a trick question?
************
2008-06-16a.gif
Ted, I've decided to gossipsize you.
************
2008-06-16b.gif
I'm spreading vicious rumors about you until you feel compelled to quit.
************
2008-06-16c.gif
People are too smart to...
************
2008-06-14a.gif
My tiny company can't survive if you insist on paying our invoices late.
************
2008-06-14b.gif
You should have thought of that before you decided to become a tiny company.
************
2008-06-14c.gif
Come here for a second.
************
2008-06-13a.gif
I've decided that your tiny company will give us an interest-free loan.
************
2008-06-13b.gif
There's no paperwork to sign.
We'll just pay your invoices late while snortling.
************
2008-06-13c.gif
This is the part where you realize your negotiating leverage is limited.
I demand no snortling!
************
2008-06-12a.gif
Let's try a mock interview to see how you respond under pressure.
************
2008-06-12b.gif
Are you a stinking weasel trying to pass as human?!!
************
2008-06-12c.gif
What gave it away?
Honestly, it was a lucky guess.
************
2008-06-11a.gif
Carefully choose your words when talking about the company's future.
************
2008-06-11b.gif
************
2008-06-11c.gif
And never, ever refer to the company as any kind of sandwich you wouldn't want to eat.
That's my favorite one!
************
2008-06-10a.gif
We've decided to write off 47 billion dollars in bad loans.
************
2008-06-10b.gif
You might think this is my fault, but in actuality it is all caused by poor regulatory oversight.
************
2008-06-10c.gif
Who is in favor of those guys taking a big pay cut?
************
2008-06-09a.gif
Asok, you never mentioned any issues this quarter, so I assume you didn't do any work.

2008-06-09c.gif
Why can't you be more like that guy?
Someone please kill me!
************
2008-06-07a.gif
The executive steering group took your recommendation to cancel all design projects.
************
2008-06-07b.gif
Uh-oh.
Your poor communication skills have sowed the seeds of our destruction.
************
2008-06-07c.gif
Am I an unclear communicator?
six o'clock.
************
2008-06-06a.gif
You won't read my technical report so I summarized it in this complicated slide.
************
2008-06-06b.gif
If you stare at it long enough you will either experience the illusion of understanding it or be too embarrassed to admit you don't.
************
2008-06-06c.gif
Do you have any questions to betray your ignorance?
Is the triangle thing mad at the tube?
************
2008-06-05a.gif
I took a class on being less useless.
Now I see the world in a different light.
************
2008-06-05b.gif
************
2008-06-05c.gif
Now my helplessness makes my uselessness seem unimportant.
************
2008-06-04a.gif
I took a class to learn how to be less useless.
************
2008-06-04b.gif
Now I carry twice as many coffee cups wherever I go.
************
2008-06-04c.gif
Does that make you work faster?
I only have two hands.
************
2008-06-03a.gif
Wally, I enrolled you in a program to cure uselessness.
************
2008-06-03b.gif
Your classmates will be a glass hammer and a bag of nothing.
************
2008-06-03c.gif
Can I borrow a pen?
Dude, no arms.
************
2008-06-02a.gif
Wally, in the past month you've blamed your lack of productivity on seven dead people and three who never existed.
************
2008-06-02b.gif
I used to blame living coworkers but it made the meetings awkward.
************
2008-06-02c.gif
Whose fault is that?
Here comes the awkward part.
************
2008-05-31a.gif
Wally, are you busy?
Yes, I'm reading the 'In Memoriam' section of our company newsletter.
************
2008-05-31b.gif
When you're done, can you compile the beta test results?
************
2008-05-31c.gif
Sure.
Just as soon as I get the data from... Larry.
************
2008-05-30a.gif
************
2008-05-30b.gif
Imagine you are a turtle and you are being attacked by a hawk.
************
2008-05-30c.gif
That's better than I expected.
************
2008-05-29a.gif
I like to use role play to evaluate job applicants.
************
2008-05-29b.gif
Pretend you're an unqualified loser.
************
2008-05-29c.gif
You're totally nailing it.
************
2008-05-28a.gif
************
2008-05-28b.gif
************
2008-05-28c.gif
Now hand over the non-standard cell phone you keep in the elastic of your underpants.
************
2008-05-27a.gif
I didn't work on your request this week because my computer is broken and my company is too cheap to replace it.
************
2008-05-27b.gif
I tried to borrow one, but the people I work with are a bunch of selfish tools.
************
2008-05-27c.gif
Maybe I shouldn't take you on sales calls.
So I built a tiny fort out of coffee stirrers.
************
2008-05-26a.gif
Maybe I could use your laptop until we have the budget to get me a computer that works.
************
2008-05-26b.gif
I might need my laptop.
I already need it.
************
2008-05-26c.gif
I need you to stop needing it.
Well played.
************
2008-05-24a.gif
My computer is broken.
I need a new one.
We don't have the budget.
************
2008-05-24b.gif
Do things that don't require a computer until the next budget cycle.
************
2008-05-24c.gif
Like churning my own butter?
You make it sound creepy.
************
2008-05-23a.gif
I think my girlfriend is only dating me to get free tech support.
I'm very surprised you think that.
************
2008-05-23b.gif
Because it's unlikely?
Because it shows self-awareness.
************
2008-05-23c.gif
She might grow to love me.
And... back to normal.
************
2008-05-22a.gif
I fixed your satellite dish connection and tuned your surround sound system.
Now can we go on our date?
************
2008-05-22b.gif
That was our date.
In ten minutes I'm dating a guy who will replace the water filter in my refrigerator.
************
2008-05-22c.gif
I can do that.
You're welcome to stay and fight him for it.
************
2008-05-21a.gif
Dilbert, when you come over tonight, wear your toolbelt.
************
2008-05-21b.gif
Because it's sexy?
************
2008-05-21c.gif
That would be between you and the squirrel that keeps chewing the cable from my satellite dish.
************
2008-05-20a.gif
I'm not attracted to you, but I'd like to date you for one month.
************
2008-05-20b.gif
That should be long enough to resolve any tech support issues on my home computer, cell phone and home theater.
************
2008-05-20c.gif
Would there be any kissing?
What kind of girl do you think I am?
************
2008-05-19a.gif
I worked all night to finish the assignments on time.
************
2008-05-19b.gif
Toss it on the pile.
Plop it on the top.
************
2008-05-19c.gif
I'd feel better if you used a different choice of words.
Toss it on the pile.
Plop it on the top.
************
2008-05-17a.gif
Before I get too invested in this conversation, tell me what you do for a living.
************
2008-05-17b.gif
I'm one of three people my boss asked to do the same assignment because he deems all of us unreliable.
************
2008-05-17c.gif
This is why I ask.
The other two people are total losers.
************
2008-05-16a.gif
Do you have the approved vendor list?
Hmmm, Alice and Asok asked for that list too.
************
2008-05-16b.gif
Are you one of three people assigned to the same project because your boss believes none of you are reliable?
************
2008-05-16c.gif
Maybe.
Hmmm, and you're the last one to ask for the list.
************
2008-05-15a.gif
We just discovered that you assigned the same project to both of us a month ago.
************
2008-05-15b.gif
Sometimes I do that when I think neither of you has more than a 50% chance of doing something right.
************
2008-05-15c.gif
Hey, I just discovered something.
Or 33.3%
************
2008-05-14a.gif
I delegated that task to Carol.
************
2008-05-14b.gif
This seems like a good time to take a personal half-day.
************
2008-05-14c.gif
I have a good feeling about this.
************
2008-05-13a.gif
Our boss asked me to make some copies.
But I fear doing such a menial task will brand me as unimportant.
************
2008-05-13b.gif
I was hoping you could make the copies for me since your career is already a bloated cadaver.
************
2008-05-13c.gif
If I am reading your body language correctly, you are wondering 'staple or no staple?'
************
2008-05-12a.gif
************
2008-05-12b.gif
Is there any risk that performing this task will make me appear less valuable?
************
2008-05-12c.gif
I need someone to tell copy boy to get to work.
************
2008-05-10a.gif
I cut the quality control budget to free up funds to increase our sales force.
************
2008-05-10b.gif
So your strategy is to sell a larger volume of defective products?
************
2008-05-10c.gif
The quality will be fine.
The tests will just take longer.
So...It's an antique thing?
************
2008-05-09a.gif
The company decided to invest a billion dollars based on your stupid made-up numbers.
************
2008-05-09b.gif
You've crushed my dreams of a better tomorrow.
************
2008-05-09c.gif
I finally made a difference at work.
how many victims?
************
2008-05-08a.gif
I didn't have any accurate numbers so I just made up this one.
************
2008-05-08b.gif
Studies have shown that accurate numbers aren't any more useful than the ones we make up.
************
2008-05-08c.gif
How many studies showed that?
Eighty-seven.
************
2008-05-07a.gif
Use the CRS database to size the market.
That data is wrong.
That data is also wrong.
************
2008-05-07b.gif
Then use the sibs database.
That data is wrong.
That data is also wrong.
************
2008-05-07c.gif
Can you average them?
Sure.
I can multiply them too.
************
2008-05-06a.gif
I acquired the musky scent of failure.
Do you have anything that can get rid of it?
************
2008-05-06b.gif
Try being successful at something important.
************
2008-05-06c.gif
I work in a fabric-covered box.
Okay, then try rubbing this behind both ears.
************
2008-05-05a.gif
Can I could on your cooperation for the next phase of the project?
No.
************
2008-05-05b.gif
You emit the musky scent of failure.
Women can detect that sort of thing.
************
2008-05-05c.gif
Would a bath fix it?
How long are you willing to stay submerged?
************
2008-05-03a.gif
You must be Dilbert.
I'm the new guy on your project team.
************
2008-05-03b.gif
What's that foul stench?
It's the stink of failure.
It follows me around from project to project.
************
2008-05-03c.gif
How do I get if off?!
You can dilute it by shaking hands.
************
2008-05-02a.gif
Our alternative fuel division has found a way to turn fresh water into fuel!
************
2008-05-02b.gif
Wouldn't that turn the world into an uninhabitable wasteland in the long run?
************
2008-05-02c.gif
Not if someone finds a way to turn oil into water.
************
2008-05-01a.gif
I thwarted the hostile takeover bid, but your CEO died in the process.

2008-05-01b.gif
I'll find you someone else to blather about quality while being grossly overpaid.
************
2008-05-01c.gif
I like your look, but can you blather?
************
2008-04-30a.gif
You can thwart this unfriendly takeover by using something called a poison pill.
************
2008-04-30b.gif
That's not...
I keep one in my watch.
I'll take it immediately.
************
2008-04-30c.gif
I suppose I could feed your tainted CEO carcass to the executives of the other company.
************
2008-04-29a.gif
I need an improbable solution to a work problem.
************
2008-04-29b.gif
Sure.
I charge one million dollars for each improbable solution.

2008-04-29c.gif
Okay, then I also need an improbable way to get things from you for free.
Stop breaking my business model.

2008-04-28a.gif
I recommend we cancel our planned merger.

2008-04-28b.gif
They plan to open a chain of fast food restaurants using our employees as a source of protein.

2008-04-26a.gif
Dilbert, I need you to handle the due diligence for our alliance with the galactic protein corporation.

Alice, I got your two weeks' notice.

2007-12-28b.gif
Will you stay if I give you a 20% raise?
Okay.
************
2007-12-28c.gif
Hey dad, do you remember you said I should never be a quitter?
You do?

2007-12-27a.gif
My new cubicle is too small.
It looks fine to me.
************
2007-12-27b.gif
It only seems small because you were so spoiled before.
************
2007-12-27c.gif
I didn't feel spoiled.
Apparently it sneaks up on you.
************
2007-12-26a.gif
And Wally, did you finish your project tasks for today?
************
2007-12-26b.gif
No.
I took a calculated risk that other people would not finish their tasks either, making my lateness totally irrelevant.
************
2007-12-26c.gif
That is the worst...
I need another week.
************
2007-12-25a.gif
Bruce, you're totally incompetent at your job, so I've moving you to another job.

Alice, I want you to move to a cubicle closer to the rest of the department.

2007-12-20b.gif
Is there a reason that isn't apparent, or is this coming from the reptilian part of your brain?
************
2007-12-20c.gif
That's a surprisingly good point.
************
2007-12-19a.gif
I'm not allowed to discuss the company politics that form a career minefield around your project.

2007-12-19b.gif

2007-12-14b.gif
Everything I needed to do required me to do something else first, until it all looped back on itself like a Mobius strip.

2007-12-14c.gif

As if I had a pencil.

Consider this bag of garbage.
It too is unemployed and yet it is worthy of love.

So it's like a super power?

2002-09-27a.gif
Why have you only finished one project at work this year?
Norma's son did three.

You can't measure someone's worth by counting the number of projects he does.

2002-09-26a.gif
Norma's son finished three projects last year.

2002-09-26b.gif
His cubicle is a double-wide.

Our dress code policy will go back to business attire.

2002-09-19c.gif
Watch out.
This might spark.

2002-09-18a.gif

Excuse me.

2002-09-16b.gif
Maybe it's because all of our computers are cardboard props that we stole from a furniture store.

2002-09-14a.gif

At first we thought he was breaking the law, but he had a written opinion from his tax lawyer saying it was probably okay.

2002-09-11c.gif
What did the board of directors do?
After loading the van?

It's not addressed to you.
I'll grant you that it's not a clean win.

2002-08-21b.gif
It's not addressed to me but it was in my box so I'm keeping it.

Why can't we be both?
I was just making conversation.

2002-08-16a.gif
Your print ads would look like this.
It's a shape with no text.

2002-08-16c.gif
Can it be green?
Who's the creative person here?

Not really.

2002-08-10b.gif
Apparently unemployment feels exactly like empowerment.

Who are you?

2002-08-09c.gif
This is exactly why I stopped coming to the office.

2002-08-08a.gif
We have too many empty cubicles.
It frightens our customers.

2002-08-08b.gif
Each of you will adopt an empty cubicle and decorate it to appear occupied.

2002-08-06b.gif
You can't come waltzing into this department, using our stuff and leaving your holes.

2002-08-06c.gif
I'll clean up the holes.
I want you to whack the people on this list.

2002-08-05a.gif
I'm tired of calling the employees 'Resources.'

2002-08-05b.gif
I'm thinking of something along the lines of livestock or human capital.

2002-08-05c.gif
I don't want them demanding hay.
Good point.
We'll go with human capital.
************
2002-08-03a.gif
I can't stop dreaming about work.

2002-08-01a.gif
Starting today, our goals will be replaced by stretch goals.
Stretch goals?
************
2002-08-01b.gif
Stretch goals are like stretch pants.
It's a way of signaling surrender.

2002-08-01c.gif
Speaking of which, I wouldn't say no to a doughnut.

Over the past year, most of my coworkers have managed expensive projects that failed.

So on an economic basis, that makes me your top performer.

2002-07-29a.gif
Do you think I should inject a deadly poison in my face to hide wrinkles?

Why do you still come to work?
I don't know how to make coffee.

2002-07-19a.gif
How could our accounting firm not notice that we were heading for bankruptcy?

Maybe there was a conflict of interest with their T-shirt design business.

It's mixed.
You have a 37&#037; return but your soul will burn for eternity.

My technology test was a huge failure because I had to use a rope as my electronic cable.

2002-07-02b.gif
Our procurement manager is a monkey who signed an exclusive cable contract with a rope vendor.

I'd rather not take sides until I hear the monkey's version.

2002-07-01c.gif
Well, maybe it was a mistake to sign an exclusive contract with a rope distributor.

2002-06-29a.gif
Okay.
Alice, you should act as if you're your own boss.

2002-06-28c.gif
Maybe he's out of the office.
No, I can hear him.

Hey, guy, cheer up.
You can choose to have a good attitude!

Roboboss, can this relationship work?
After all, I'm a human..

2002-06-18a.gif
My boss ordered me to make our accounting records more confusing.
Is that ethical?

2002-06-18b.gif
It's as ethical as the massive short-sell I'm going to place in the next ten seconds.

2002-06-18c.gif
Maybe you're the wrong one to ask.

2002-06-17a.gif
Stockholders are worried that our profits are nothing but accounting gimmicks.

2002-06-10b.gif
From now on you're only allowed to talk about work.

I think my mystique just took a hit.
************
2002-06-07a.gif
The other engineers are complaining because you have a private office.

2002-06-07b.gif
Maybe you should explain to each of them that life isn't fair.
************
2002-06-07c.gif
Yeah, I guess it IS easier to explain it to one person.

2002-06-06a.gif
Aah..

All I ask is that when you enter Diltopia, you bow in reverence and take off your shoes.

2002-06-04a.gif
We sure have a lot of vacant offices since the layoffs.

2002-06-01c.gif
What if the second one is defective too?
Sheesh...

2002-05-31a.gif
Alice, according to this book, people can choose their attitudes.

2002-05-31b.gif
So you decided to go with a dopey and gullible theme?

2002-05-31c.gif
And that's another interesting choice.

How's the treasure hunt going?
Have you found any loot?

2002-05-30b.gif
It's not about the 'loot' as you say.
We detectors are motivated by the thrill of the hunt.

2002-05-30c.gif
I could seed the carpet with nickels.
I tried that but I can't find them.

2002-05-29a.gif
Wally, what do you expect to find here with a metal detector?

2002-05-29b.gif
My first choice is some sort of priceless treasure.
But I wouldn't say no to a bottle cap.

I'm thinking about huge barges and trained porpoises - lots of them.

2002-02-20a.gif
None of us has designed a nuclear power plant before but we can figure it out by using our process.

Isn't that another way of saying you're ignorant?
************
2002-02-15a.gif
You finished the project below your estimate and on time.

2002-02-15b.gif
All I need are a few changes at your hourly fee, which was never specified in our contract.
************
2002-02-15c.gif

2002-02-14a.gif
I've reduced our development costs by outsourcing the project.

Does the proposal have a huge hourly rate for any work not specified in the contract?

2002-02-14c.gif
Stay out of it.
Why do you ask?

2002-02-02a.gif
The men here are oblivious to my abuse.
What did you do to them?

2002-02-02b.gif
I siphoned off their self-respect and keep it in vials in a storage room.

2002-02-02c.gif
This is no fun.
I quit.
Do you want to yell at the vials with me?
************
2002-02-01a.gif
You're being fired for being a man.

Here are some projects to finish before your last day.
************
2002-01-08b.gif
But..
Hee Hee!
************
2002-01-08c.gif
I'll get this information to you right away.
Is ninety days soon enough?
************
2002-01-07a.gif
Your project is cancelled.
You'll be downsized in ninety days.
************
2002-01-07b.gif
Until then, feel free to wander around like a zombie.
************
2002-01-07c.gif
I walk among them but I am not one of them.

2002-01-05a.gif
Sorry I'm late.

2002-01-05b.gif
I left my mission statement paperweight in the sun and it set my cubicle on fire.
************
2002-01-05c.gif
We are Quality" mug but the handle broke and I got shards.

2002-01-04a.gif
************
2002-01-04b.gif
************
2002-01-04c.gif
You're right; I was the only one who would enter that ridiculous contest.
************
2002-01-03a.gif
I gathered all the padded cost estimates from the liars and scoundrels I'm ashamed to call co-workers.
************
2002-01-03b.gif
That's okay.
I usually ignore our cost estimates and make bid proposals that I think will win.
************
2002-01-03c.gif
I gather inaccurate data for a living.
Luckily no one uses it.
Your glass is half full.
************
2002-01-02a.gif
I need your cost estimates for my bid proposal.
A billion dollars.
************
2002-01-02b.gif
That sounds high for administrative overhead.
If you already know the cost, why ask me?
************
2002-01-02c.gif
You'll make us lose the bid.
I like to think of it as winning less work.
************
2002-01-01a.gif
Dilbert, I want you to put together the winning bid for this contract.
************
2002-01-01b.gif
No problem, I'll just read the minds of our competitors and bid lower.
************
2002-01-01c.gif
But it's partly blocked by a dense mass.
************
2001-12-31a.gif
Carol, I want you to help me put together a morale boosting event.
************
2001-12-31b.gif
Great idea.
And after that maybe I can do CPR on a mummy and see if I can save its life.
************
2001-12-31c.gif
Do you hear what I'm saying?
************
2001-12-29a.gif
Alice, all of your hard work - the nights and the weekends - are finally paying off.
************
2001-12-29b.gif
We increased our five-year forecast of demand by ten percent!
************
2001-12-29c.gif
You changed a wild guess by ten percent?
Thanks to you!
************
2001-12-28a.gif
Alice, I just sent you an email.
************
2001-12-28b.gif
Here's a copy of my message but I'll just tell you what it says.
************
2001-12-28c.gif
It says I sent you a voice mail telling you to look for a fax that says I want to talk to you.
************
2001-12-27a.gif
If you give a man a fish, he will eat for a day.
************
2001-12-27b.gif
But if you teach a man to fish, he will buy an ugly hat.
************
2001-12-27c.gif
And if you talk about fish to a starving man then you're a consultant.
************
2001-12-26a.gif
I need your approval for this expense.
The equipment is already here and installed.
************
2001-12-26b.gif
I left out the description because you wouldn't understand it anyway.
************
2001-12-26c.gif
There's a fine line between managing and being totally useless.
Luckily it looks the same.
************
2001-12-25a.gif
Dude, why haven't you answered my e-mail?
************
2001-12-25b.gif
Your message was so poorly written that I didn't understand it and I didn't dare to start a dialogue.
************
2001-12-25c.gif
Maybe you should e-mail him.
************
2001-12-24a.gif
Sometimes I feel guilty that I'm not doing enough to enhance stockholder value.
************
2001-12-24b.gif

************
2001-12-24c.gif
I'll take that as a No.
************
2001-12-22a.gif
Bob, I hold in my hands the most important document ever created.
************
2001-12-22b.gif
It's a signed petition to end war.
I expect to win the Nobel Peace Prize for this.
************
2001-12-22c.gif
May I have a sip of that?
Trade ya.
************
2001-12-21a.gif
I'm starting a petition to end war.
Do you want in on this?
************
2001-12-21b.gif
Say what?
Who are you going to give it to?
************
2001-12-21c.gif
I'll sign it for a dollar.
************
2001-12-20a.gif
I want to move you to another cubicle but my office moving budget is shot.
************
2001-12-20b.gif
So I'm going to transfer you to Elbonia and then back so I can use the relocation budget.
************
2001-12-20c.gif
He says the relocation budget is shot but you can mail yourself home.
************
2001-12-19a.gif
Wally, you have failed to achieve any of your written objectives.
************
2001-12-19b.gif
But by pure chance you achieved all of my hidden objectives.
************
2001-12-19c.gif
Here's another project I need smothered with defectiveness.
I'm all over it.
************
2001-12-18a.gif
According to this survey the compensation here is 'competitive.'
************
2001-12-18b.gif
Competitive means not the highest.
************
2001-12-18c.gif
Should we continue working as hard as we can or should we back off to a more competitive level?
************
2001-12-17a.gif
I'm signing up volunteers to serve food to the homeless on Christmas day.
************
2001-12-17b.gif
How do you know in advance that they'll be extra hungry on that one day?
************
2001-12-17c.gif
Our P.R.
firm makes sure they don't get fed for two days before the news crews arrive.
************
2001-12-15a.gif
Who called this meeting?
We thought you did.
************
2001-12-15b.gif
I think we should discuss issues and assign tasks so it's not a complete waste of time.
************
2001-12-15c.gif
Maybe meetings have become a lifeform capable of calling themselves and thus reproducing via human hosts.
************
2001-12-14a.gif
Our copier is broken.
May I use yours?
Only if you use your own paper.
************
2001-12-14b.gif
I just need one copy and my office is about a mile away.
Don't make me unleash the hound.
************
2001-12-14c.gif
That's a hound?
Technically he's a web designer in a tight labor market.
************
2001-12-13a.gif
Each team has one hour to design and build a mock-up using these common materials.
************
2001-12-13b.gif
Question: doesn't this sort of exercise usually get dominated by the worst team member?
************
2001-12-13c.gif
Don't worry, we can just ignore Alice's suggestions.
************
2001-12-12a.gif
Everyone grab an odd-shaped piece of foam and sit down.
************
2001-12-12b.gif
We'll continue the design process by pointing to these brainstorm notes and making insightful observations.
************
2001-12-12c.gif
The notes are all yellow.
Sweet jeepers!!!
You're all engineers!
************
2001-12-11a.gif
Team One made a device that converts air to electricity.
************
2001-12-11b.gif
Team Two used their hour to create a missile defense laser.
************
2001-12-11c.gif
Team Three, do you need more time?
It's a scissors holder!
************
2001-12-10a.gif
We've hired the world's most innovative design firm.
************
2001-12-10b.gif
We'll observe their successful methods and steal them for our own.
************
2001-12-10c.gif
Maybe their secret is hiring smart people.
I'm hoping it involves easels.
************
2001-12-08a.gif
You need to hire people who won't be a threat to you.
************
2001-12-08b.gif
************
2001-12-08c.gif
I don't know...
They still look threatening.
Perhaps I can interest you in our cadaver program.
************
2001-12-07a.gif
The great thing about free speech is that I can criticize the government.

I'd fire you for that too.
************
2001-12-07c.gif
Sure.
It's a free country.
************
2001-12-06a.gif
Thank you, but I can only accept gifts under $25.

2001-12-06b.gif
Rules are rules.
************
2001-12-06c.gif
************
2001-12-05a.gif
I can teach you to manage your time more efficiently.
************
2001-12-05b.gif
Put all of your high priorities on one list and your low priorities on another.
************
2001-12-05c.gif
Then do everything on both lists even if it kills you.
Otherwise you're a freakin' loser.
************
2001-12-04a.gif
Carol, reserve the conference room every day for the next day in case I need it.
************
2001-12-04b.gif
You're too late.
Some other sociopath had the same idea and beat you to it.
************
2001-12-04c.gif
I hate being the slowest sociopath.
************
2001-12-03a.gif
My accomplishments for the week include scheduling a meeting.
************
2001-12-03b.gif
But some people were using the conference room so we milled around for a while and gave up.
************
2001-12-03c.gif
You could have used another room.
What part of 'gave up' is confusing you?
************
2001-12-01a.gif
Now I can't pay my rent!
************
2001-12-01b.gif
Would it be okay if I lived here in my cubicle?
I don't see why not.
************
2001-12-01c.gif
Can I have fires and become a cannibal?
Well, I might regret this later......
************
2001-11-30a.gif
Okay, let me think aloud for a minute.
************
2001-11-30b.gif
************
2001-11-30c.gif
That didn't help as much as I had hoped.
************
2001-11-29a.gif
Your airline is accused of providing inhumane service.
How do you respond?
************
2001-11-29b.gif
************
2001-11-29c.gif
You're not allowed to say Bah.
Take it back.
************
2001-11-28a.gif
************
2001-11-28b.gif
Please form a primitive society and live in the terminal forever.

The good news is that you'll earn six 'Dogbert Miles' that can be used on the 35th of every month.

According to my computer your flight is delayed by weather.

2001-11-27c.gif
Our planes can't handle direct sunlight.

2001-11-26a.gif
I'm going to start an airline that has no planes.
************
2001-11-26b.gif
I'll take people's money and make them sit in a crowded room while ex-cons steal from their luggage.
************
2001-11-26c.gif
I call that 'mechanical difficulties.'
************
2001-11-24a.gif
I'm authorized give each of you one dollar of severance pay.
************
2001-11-24b.gif
************
2001-11-24c.gif
How much were we paying you?
Nothing.
We were entirely motivated by slogans.
************
2001-11-23a.gif
We manufacture our mud using bottled water and bags of fertile soil.
************
2001-11-23b.gif
There's a huge demand in my country for bottled water and bags of soil.
************
2001-11-23c.gif
************
2001-11-22a.gif
Our business plan was to sell mud to people who live in mud.
************
2001-11-22b.gif
Later we shrewdly expanded our offerings to include pet grooming and lingerie.
************
2001-11-22c.gif
Frankly, I blame our ad agency for what happened next.
************
2001-11-21a.gif
Can anyone tell me why your mud delivery business is failing?
************
2001-11-21b.gif
Is it because of the general economic slow down?
Dot-com meltdown?
************
2001-11-21c.gif
And maybe because you sell mud to people who live in mud?
************
2001-11-20a.gif
I'm supposed to shut down our Elbonian mud delivery business.
************
2001-11-20b.gif
But I'm a highly trained engineer so I will analyze their business model and fix it.
************
2001-11-20c.gif
They deliver mud to people who live in mud.
You have my attention.
************
2001-11-19a.gif
Dilbert, you're going to Elbonia to shut down our Elbonian mud delivery business.
************
2001-11-19b.gif
Meanwhile, I'll tell our stockholders that we expect the mud delivery business to make huge profits.
************
2001-11-19c.gif
Um... is this illegal?
There's no law against optimism!
************
2001-11-17a.gif
May I have a day off to move my home?
************
2001-11-17b.gif
What?
Why only one hour?
I like to negotiate.
************
2001-11-17c.gif
I guess I can try doing it in one hour.
And you can't use a vehicle.
************
2001-11-16a.gif
I plan to use my raise to move my home in the handicapped stall to a storage facility.
************
2001-11-16b.gif
If you are trying to think of a housewarming gift, I wouldn't say no to a flashlight.

Hi.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

2001-11-14b.gif
Thank you very much.

2001-11-14c.gif
We network design engineers like to dress with a theme.
May I call you crazy old coot?

2001-11-13a.gif
Your psychological profile test results are excellent.
Can you start Monday?
************
2001-11-13b.gif
Monday is fine.
I'll read the employee handbook over the weekend.

2001-11-12a.gif
Our CEO's goal is to improve our revenue per employee.
************
2001-11-12b.gif
Last week his goal was to reduce the number of contractors.
So you cancelled my contract and hired me as an employee.

2001-11-12c.gif
Well, it looks like someone doesn't like having his cheese moved.

But it's not actually in an actual town hall.
And I'll have questions in advance, so it's not a meeting per se.

2001-11-09c.gif
Who do we give our questions to?
I think you'll find that it doesn't matter.

2001-11-08a.gif
Wally looks different.

2001-11-08b.gif
He changed when he started yoga classes.

2001-11-08c.gif
All I'm saying is that it might not be a "yoga" class.
Suspicious you are.

2001-11-07a.gif
I've lost two pounds since I signed up for yoga class.
************
2001-11-07b.gif
And I never get sick anymore.
You haven't had a class yet.

2001-11-07c.gif
Maybe I'm some sort of yoga prodigy.
************
2001-11-06a.gif
I signed up for a yoga class.

From what is he recovering?
Is it a cold or perhaps a flu?

Good point.
I'd better add 'easy to use' to the list.

You don't give your opinion on anything.

Luckily I had lots of optional guts.

Don't be afraid of change.

You're right!

2001-03-12c.gif
I've always wondered what would happen if someone listened to you.

2001-03-10a.gif
It wasn't nice to meet you.

2001-03-10b.gif
You didn't buy enough; I'll probably spank my hamster for no reason.

2001-03-10c.gif
Repeat business is over-rated.

2001-03-09a.gif
Five minutes after you buy it you'll want to throw it through a window.

2001-03-09b.gif
We sell these at a loss but we make it up with our window repair business.

2001-03-09c.gif
It fell off.
Sometimes the components actually die from shame.

Why?

No, no, no.

2001-03-07b.gif
You need the security and reliability of the XQ-7.

Okay, I'll take the XQ-7.

You've been demoted back to non-management.

2001-03-03a.gif
How do you like being a manager, Alice?

Do me a big favor; sneak into my house tonight and smother me with a pillow.

2001-03-03c.gif
I think she was kidding.

You twist the ears to unlock the skull.

2001-03-01b.gif
Find the moral compass and deactivate it.

2001-03-01c.gif
The result is something called leadership.
You're working weekends!

2001-02-28a.gif
There are two essential rules of management.

2001-02-28b.gif
One: The customer is always right.

2001-02-28c.gif
Two: They must be punished for their arrogance!
************
2001-02-27a.gif
What would you do if you made a huge, incredibly stupid mistake?
************
2001-02-27b.gif
I would try to learn from it.
************
2001-02-27c.gif
Did you learn anything from your answer?
************
2001-02-26a.gif
No one knows the secret location of the Management Training Facility.

2001-02-26b.gif
If no one knows where it is, how do we get there?

2001-02-26c.gif

You're a manager now; You won't be needing me.

2001-02-23c.gif
Here's a claim ticket in case you get demoted or learn to play sax.
************
2001-02-22a.gif
I inadvertently gave Alice verbal praise.
Is she addicted?

2001-02-22b.gif
She's been lying and stealing to get more.
She leaves us no choice.

I have to promote you to management.

I need some deliverables so I can be praised again.

2001-02-21c.gif

2001-02-20a.gif
I experienced something called positive reinforcement today.
************
2001-02-20b.gif
I'm addicted to it now...
************
2001-02-20c.gif
Say something nice about me!
For a crazy woman you don't drool much.

2001-02-19a.gif
What is this strange and beautiful feeling inside of me?

2001-02-19b.gif
Waves of ecstasy are pulsing through my soul.

2001-02-19c.gif
This is why I only give positive reinforcement once a year.

Good news?!

In other words, you torture fish for fun.

I wonder why everything I do sounds bad when it's put in other words.

2001-02-15a.gif
The key to happiness is self-delusion.

2001-02-15b.gif
Don't think of yourself as an organic pain collector racing toward oblivion.

2001-02-15c.gif
Don't blame me; I said don't.

2001-01-15c.gif
I've got nothing.

2001-01-13a.gif
If you work hard, you can achieve great things!
************
2001-01-13b.gif
And then you die.
************
2001-01-13c.gif
It never pays to mix reality with inspirational speeches.
************
2001-01-12a.gif
It seems like your job isn't very rewarding.
Vision getting blurry.
************
2001-01-12b.gif
Long hours.
No raises.
Hair coming out in clumps.
************
2001-01-12c.gif
He's good.
He's very good.

2001-01-11a.gif

2001-01-11b.gif
************
2001-01-11c.gif
Hard work can kill me?
If you're lucky.
************
2001-01-10a.gif
You will be my greatest challenge.
************
2001-01-10b.gif
I'll bet you get paid less than minimum wage and they don't reimburse you for travel.
************
2001-01-10c.gif
So, what kind of career path you got going?
************
2001-01-09a.gif
Hello, employee.
************
2001-01-09b.gif
My magic wand will make you enjoy working despite the utter futility.
************
2001-01-09c.gif
Knock yourself out.
************
2001-01-08a.gif
Do you have a plan for retaining the best employees?
************
2001-01-08b.gif
I whittle at their confidence until they believe no one else would ever hire them.
************
2001-01-08c.gif
Doesn't that make them sluggish?
Yes, but if they're all sluggish, it looks right.
************
2001-01-06a.gif
My plan is to give away our product for free.
************
2001-01-06b.gif
We'll only bill customers who ask us to deinstall it.

************
2001-01-05a.gif
I created software that makes all copyrighted work on the net available for free!
************
2001-01-05b.gif
Wouldn't that destroy all forms of creativity and plunge us into a depression?
************
2001-01-05c.gif
Yes...
But it is very neat.
************
2001-01-04a.gif
My head-ache is a doozy.
************
2001-01-04b.gif
************
2001-01-04c.gif
I'm just getting started!
************
2001-01-03a.gif
Mine saves twenty million.
************
2001-01-03b.gif
My project will take a year to complete.
Mine takes a week.

Topper, I have half a mind...
Topper, I have half a mind...
I have one percent of a mind.

2001-01-02a.gif
I'm getting a mouse cramp.
************
2001-01-02b.gif
I spent seven years chained upside down to an Elbonian prison wall.
************
2001-01-02c.gif
At the risk of sounding too competitive, I believe I'm winning this conversation.
************
2001-01-01a.gif
Dilbert, meet Topper.
He's amazing.
************
2001-01-01b.gif
************
2001-01-01c.gif
How are you?
I can't go first.
It ruins my system.
************
2000-12-30a.gif
I asked for more e-mail storage space and you deleted all of my files!
************
2000-12-30b.gif
You complain when I ignore your requests and you complain when I delete your files.
************
2000-12-30c.gif
Those aren't your only choices!
I can't please everyone.
************
2000-12-29a.gif
A manager's brain is like a pump.
If it becomes empty you must prime it.
************
2000-12-29b.gif
Whatever he learns first will form the foundation for all of his future perceptions.
************
2000-12-29c.gif
This guy has been talking smack about you.
************
2000-12-28a.gif
I'll tape a pencil to his hand and use it to sign off on a raise for me.
************
2000-12-28b.gif
That would be so unethical... hiccup.
May I have ten percent?
************
2000-12-28c.gif
That hiccup damaged my moral compass.
************
2000-12-27a.gif
He might be faking a coma to avoid work.
************
2000-12-27b.gif
The only way to find out is to punch him repeatedly.
************
2000-12-27c.gif
Maybe we should get Alice.
Do you remember if I'm right- or left-handed?
************
2000-12-26a.gif
I think he tried to meditate.
That's the problem.
************
2000-12-26b.gif
You shouldn't mix meditation with management.
The mind gets too empty.
************
2000-12-26c.gif
What can we do?
I plan to rifle through his pockets.
************
2000-12-25a.gif
I must clear my mind of all thoughts.
************
2000-12-25b.gif
At the end of the day we'll be in a market space on a going forward basis.
************
2000-12-25c.gif
I'll come back when you're done practicing being useless.
************
2000-12-23a.gif
************
2000-12-23b.gif
You should punish the others for unscrupulously padding their objectives!
Those lying weasels!
************
2000-12-23c.gif
************
2000-12-22a.gif
************
2000-12-22b.gif
I need to remind myself how lucky I am that I don't have your laziness or personality or looks.
************
2000-12-22c.gif
Would you say I'm kind of a Renaissance loser?
************
2000-12-21a.gif
I'm thinking of adopting an incomprehensible accent so people won't ask me questions.
************
2000-12-21b.gif
Um... Are you leaving that coffee pot empty right in front of me?

There will be no more Casual Dress Days.

2000-12-20b.gif
We believe that employees work harder when they are wearing uncomfortable clothes.
************
2000-12-20c.gif
************
2000-12-19a.gif
Casual Dress Day is hurting our productivity.
We need to cancel it.
************
2000-12-19b.gif
Is it possible that our real problems are caused by irrational management?
************
2000-12-19c.gif
No, I think comfortable pants are the problem.
Sounds right.
************
2000-12-18a.gif
I worry that casual dress days encourage flirtatious behavior.
************
2000-12-18b.gif
I mean, look how adorable I am in my turtleneck sweater.
How are the ladies supposed to concentrate?
************
2000-12-18c.gif
Do you think I should put warning cones around my cubicle?
************
2000-12-16a.gif
Are there any questions?
Are there any questions?

2000-12-16c.gif
Do you ever feel alone when you're with people?

2000-12-15a.gif
I attended your meeting.
************
2000-12-15b.gif
All you did was sit there like a drunken monkey.
Talk to my boss.
************
2000-12-15c.gif
So it doesn't seem fair.
************
2000-12-14a.gif
If anything happens to me, Wally will be your leader.
************
2000-12-14b.gif
Quick, take it!
I have a multi-vitamin!
************
2000-12-14c.gif
We're safe for now.
This turned out to be a mixed blessing.
************
2000-12-13a.gif
I've been told to make a succession plan.
************
2000-12-13b.gif
I can help.

2000-12-12b.gif
If I tell you it's good, you'll rub it in my face at your performance review.

We don't have enough engineers to handle all the requests for sales support.

2000-12-09a.gif
We find the defendant guilty...

2000-12-09b.gif
... of this crime and maybe a few others that didn't come up.

2000-12-09c.gif
************
2000-12-08a.gif
My client's life now rests in your capable hands.
************
2000-12-08b.gif
************
2000-12-08c.gif
Did anything happen after 'Please rise'?
************
2000-12-07a.gif
Your honor, it is against my religion to judge others.
************
2000-12-07b.gif
************
2000-12-07c.gif
I just changed my religion!
************
2000-12-06a.gif
Juror eight, do you have any medical problems that would prevent you from serving?
************
2000-12-06b.gif
No, I need jury duty.
************
2000-12-06c.gif
Would it be fair to say you don't know what you need?
Why does everyone ask me that?
************
2000-12-05a.gif
What excuse are you planning to use?
************
2000-12-05b.gif
I'm happy to serve.

2000-12-05c.gif
Insanity; good one.

2000-12-04a.gif
************
2000-12-04b.gif
I'll have hours of quiet time to read my new book.

2000-12-04c.gif
There's a guy here with a book.

2000-12-02a.gif
************
2000-12-02b.gif
Which one of you angels administered the life-saving CPR?
************
2000-12-02c.gif
************
2000-12-01a.gif
I'll see if the guys in marketing know First Aid.
************
2000-12-01b.gif
************
2000-12-01c.gif
Apparently our team-building potluck lunch didn't take.
************
2000-11-30a.gif
Okay, we have one vote for using CPR, one vote for the Heimlich Maneuver...
************
2000-11-30b.gif
And two votes for sneaking up behind him and yelling 'boo'.
************
2000-11-30c.gif
I don't see how we can get behind him.
What if we drill a hole from below?
************
2000-11-29a.gif
************
2000-11-29b.gif
************
2000-11-29c.gif
Um...
I don't think so.
We'd better strip him and shave him just in case.
************
2000-11-28a.gif
The company will be holding mandatory CPR training for all employees.
************
2000-11-28b.gif
I am surrounded by pear-shaped, beef-eating, middle-aged men who I prefer not to touch.
************
2000-11-28c.gif
Uh-oh...
I hope that's just stress.
************
2000-11-27a.gif
Wally, we can't find our CPR dummy.
I need your help.
************
2000-11-27b.gif
Finding it?
************
2000-11-27c.gif
Yes.
Assuming you can do that while lying on your back with your mouth open.
************
2000-11-25a.gif
I used to not care about my subordinates.
************
2000-11-25b.gif
But that's all changed.
************
2000-11-25c.gif
Now I delegate the not-caring function to what's-her-face over here.
************
2000-11-24a.gif
Dilbert, my man, you're stayin' real and keepin' to the core.
************
2000-11-24b.gif
Is that good?
I don't even know what it means.
************
2000-11-24c.gif
Why do you say things that have no meaning?
Du-u-u-de!
************
2000-11-23a.gif
How much did you make in tips today?
************
2000-11-23b.gif
Three breath mints and one death threat scrawled on a napkin.
************
2000-11-23c.gif
I hope I don't forget which breath mint came from the napkin guy.
************
2000-11-22a.gif
I hate working for tips.
No, I ordered the R.F.P.
************
2000-11-22b.gif
************
2000-11-22c.gif
With any luck, she'll say, 'You had me at cow'.
************
2000-11-21a.gif
My name is Wally and I'll be your engineer.
************
2000-11-21b.gif
Our special today is incomprehensible mumbling in an acronym sauce with a snide of attitude.
************
2000-11-21c.gif
I'll just have a technical review.
Do you want sarcasm with that?
************
2000-11-20a.gif
All music on the internet should be free.
Artists could make money from digital tips.
************
2000-11-20b.gif
Great idea.
We'll do the same thing here with the engineers.
************
2000-11-20c.gif
Have you ever noticed that my ideas are only brilliant when applied to other people?
************
2000-11-18a.gif
These copies you made for me are blank.
************
2000-11-18b.gif
That's because all the originals were blank.
************
2000-11-18c.gif
Maybe you could have checked the other sides.
Talk to the hand.

************
2000-11-17b.gif
I get it.
Hee hee!
Get what?
************
2000-11-17c.gif
Then I said, 'Don't get mad: try counting to fifteen'.
Ouch.

It's a pleasure to meet you, Alice.

That was a good hand shake.

2000-11-15a.gif
I'm Alice.

2000-11-15b.gif
I wear safety goggles.
Isn't that dangerous?

I'm the new temp.
Um...
I'm Alice.
************
2000-11-14a.gif
************
2000-11-14b.gif
Should we sell our mailing lists, spam without mercy, or just blackmail customers?
************
2000-11-14c.gif
We know all about your clumping problems.
************
2000-11-13a.gif
We have a gigantic database full of customer behavior information.
************
2000-11-13b.gif
Excellent.
We can use non-linear math and data mining technology to optimize our retail channels!
************
2000-11-13c.gif
If that's the same thing as spam, we're having a good meeting here.
************
2000-11-11a.gif
************
2000-11-11b.gif
Hey, you're disguising punishments as perks!

************
2000-11-08c.gif
Sometimes I like to sit quietly and think up ideas.

2000-11-07a.gif
You should put an 'E-' in front of your title.

2000-11-07b.gif
It's too boring just being the Director of Information, Operations and Technology.

2000-10-28b.gif
You fired me yesterday for non-business use of the internet.

Crime doesn't pay.

2000-10-27a.gif
I fired everyone who used the internet for personal stuff.

2000-10-27b.gif
The only wrinkle in that policy is that you and I are the only employees left.

2000-10-27c.gif
And frankly, I use the web for personal stuff too.
Can you teach me how?

It proves I'm better at setting objectives than you are at achieving them.
