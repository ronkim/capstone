# capstone

count_syllables.py - counts the number of syllables in each panel
crop_and_ocr.py - using cropped_dialogue_regions.xml, crop a region of each panel containing dialogue and perform OCR
cropped_dialogue_regions.xml - file generated by dilbert_of OpenFrameworks project to manipulate image in each panel to identify bounding boxes containing likely dialogue regions
dilbert.py - runs Python server to allow users visiting web page to create new comic strip mashups. Depends on access to each individual comic strip panel (see below for link since size of comic strip archive is too large for GitHub)
dilbertstripsall_formatted_transcript.txt - transcripts of dialog scraped from Dilbert.com
master_panel_transcripts.txt - transcripts of dialogue associated with each panel
scrape_comics_and_dialogue.py - scrapes Dilbert.com to grab every strip and dialogue text associated with each strip

All individual comic strips and separated panels are available in a single 1.6 GB file at https://www.dropbox.com/s/gkc65hver6dqgf0/images.zip?dl=0
