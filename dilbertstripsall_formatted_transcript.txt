Asok: <<<
I followed your investment advice and lost all of my savings in the stock market
>>> Boss: <<<
Did I mention that past performance is not an indication of future returns.
>>> Asok: <<<
Then... how does "advice" actually work?
>>> Boss: <<<
It only works for the people that give it.
>>>
2015-02-25 * 
Asok: <<<
I bought my first stock and it went up five percent in one week! That means I'm a stock-picking genius. I plan to  max out all of my credit cards and become a day-trader.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
The total market is up six percent.
>>> Asok: <<<
That's just luck. It can't do that forever.
>>>
2015-02-24 * 
Boss: <<<
Asok, you can beat market averages by doing your own stock research.
>>> Asok: <<<
So... you believe every investor can beat the average by reading the same information?
>>> Boss: <<<
Yes.
>>> Asok: <<<
Makes you wonder why more people don't do it.
>>> Boss: <<<
Just lazy, I guess.
>>>
2015-02-23 * 
Lessons in Investing. Boss: <<<
You should buy a stock whenever the chart looks like a squirrel sitting on a clown's shoulder. That's called "technical analysis."
>>> Asok: <<<
I'm not going to do that.
>>> Boss: <<<
Good. Because it doesn't work if everyone does it.
>>>
2015-02-22 * 
Boss: <<<
How many days will it take to finish the tests?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Three.
>>> Boss: <<<
You have two.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I can't do it in two days. That's why I said three.
>>> Boss: <<<
That was before I used my leadership skills to tell you to do it in two days.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Leadership doesn't change the laws of physics. The test takes three days.
>>> Boss: <<<
You have two. Leadership! These test results look incomplete.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Just like my soul.
>>>
2015-02-21 * 
Asok: <<<
Do you have any investment tips?
>>> Boss: <<<
You're asking the right person! I can teach you how to time the market, catch a falling knife, and invest in a dead-cat bounce. That's my system.
>>> Asok: <<<
What about diversification?
>>> Boss: <<<
I don't invest in anything I can't spell.
>>>
2015-02-20 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I destroyed the Elbonian Internet in retaliation for their alleged hacking, as you wished.
>>> CEO: <<<
Buwhahahaha! They will rue the day they allegedly hacked us.
>>> Elbonian 1: <<<
I feel more focused already.
>>> Elbonian 2: <<<
I haven't been angry at idiots all day!
>>>
2015-02-19 * 
Dilbert: <<<
My company sent me to crash the Elbonian Internet in retaliation for hacking us.
>>> Elbonian 1: <<<
Can you hear me now?
>>> Elbonian 2: <<<
It's better without the string!
>>>
2015-02-18 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I have been sent to disable the Elbonian Internet as retaliation for hacking into our corporate network.
>>> Elbonian 1: <<<
Only our elites use the Internet. The rest of us don't care. Knock yourself out.
>>> Elbonian 2: <<<
Zero, zero, one, zero, one...
>>> Elbonian 3: <<<
I wish someone would just disable this thing.
>>>
2015-02-17 * 
CEO: <<<
We think Elbonians hacked into our network.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's unlikely.
>>> CEO: <<<
We must respond proportionately by hacking their entire Internet.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It's not much of an Internet.
>>> CEO: <<<
What do you need to cripple it.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
A plane ticket and scissors.
>>>
2015-02-16 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Yay! I have another full day of doing nothing but rearranging zeros and ones. You know it will be a good day when there is no human interaction on the schedule.
>>> Tina: <<<
How's your day going?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Well, it started good...
>>>
2015-02-15 * 
Dilbert: <<<
There's a bad story about you on the Internet. Apparently, you described a plan to "ruin any journalist who writes an unfair story" about us.
>>> CEO: <<<
That was off the record!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You said it in front of a dozen reporters at a business event.
>>> CEO: <<<
It was just bar conversation. I was making a point about fairness.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Hmmm... but now no sane writer would write a negative article about us. I can't tell if you're a brilliant leader or criminally insane.
>>> CEO: <<<
I'd show you the Venn diagram they gave us in CEO school, but it just looks like a circle.
>>>
2015-02-14 * 
Asok: <<<
A 27-year-old tech millionaire published his list of fifty things you need to do to succeed.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
In other words, he has no idea why he succeeded.
>>> Asok: <<<
Sure he does. He even has a chart of his top thirty... priorities. Okay, I hear it now.
>>>
2015-02-13 * 
Negotiations Continue. Salesman: <<<
I can't meet your delivery deadline unless you agree to my price today.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
If you don't agree to my price today, management is likely to do a reorg soon and change its mind about this project.
>>> Salesman: <<<
How often does that happen?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It hasn't happened since breakfast, so we're overdue.
>>>
2015-02-12 * 
Salesman: <<<
I'll start our negotiation by setting the anchor price at...
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Five dollars.
>>> Salesman: <<<
Um, I was going to say $27,500, but you beat me to the anchor, and now I can't help thinking the fair price is closer to $5. How does an engineer know more about the intricacies of my job than I do?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I had five minutes and a browser.
>>>
2015-02-11 * 
CEO: <<<
I returned from the afterlife and I'm taking back my job as CEO.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So... you're an angel?
>>> CEO: <<<
I set all of the thermostats to 140 degrees. Let's see how long it takes you to answer your own question.
>>>
2015-02-10 * 
Asok: <<<
Elon Musk is worried that artificial intelligence will destroy mankind.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Why would you pay attention to him? What's he ever done?
>>> Asok: <<<
Stop making root for A.I.
>>> Coworker: <<<
And what planet is this "Elon" guy from, anyway?
>>>
2015-02-09 * 
Woman: <<<
How's work?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I taught robots how to emotionally manipulate people and thus guaranteed that homo sapeins will become slaves to machines.
>>> Woman: <<<
I don't want to think about that.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's why it works.
>>>
2015-02-08 * 
Wally: <<<
Can I create my own job? I hear people do that. They figure out what they are good at and then they create a job around it. I'm more of a strategic thinker than a worker bee. My job could be to attend meetings and say strategic things. And, of course, I would have no time to respond to email because I'd be busy being strategic.
>>> Boss: <<<
It feels as if you want a job that doesn't involve work.
>>> Wally: <<<
Would you trust a strategic thinker who can't solve his own problems?
>>>
2015-02-07 * 
Coworker: <<<
Sales are up 900% since we programmed our robots to emotionally manipulate their owners into buying upgrades.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Um, you do know marketing is only legal because it doesn't work most of the time, right? Coworker; Nope. I do not know that. Shiny!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
We invented a technology to enslave homo sapiens?
>>>
2015-02-06 * 
The Emotionally Manipulative Robot. Robot: <<<
It isn't too late to buy an extended warranty for me. I mean, wow! Think about the enormous expense of fixing me if something unexpected happens. If you need me, I'll be on a wobbly ladder, changing light bulbs near the pool
2015-02-05 * 
The Emotionally Manipulative Robot. Robot: <<<
People who are not losers buy memory upgrades for their robots. Only upgrade me if it's what you want. But if you don't, there's a very good chance I'll turn into a killing machine.
>>> Man: <<<
I guess I'll upgrade.
>>> Robot: <<<
I'm okay either way. It's totally up to you.
>>>
2015-02-04 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I'm programming our robot line to emotionally manipulate their owners into buying upgrades.
>>> Wally: <<<
You're teaching cloud-connected robots all over the world how to surreptitiously control humans?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Technically, yea. But free will is an illusion anyway.
>>> Wally: <<<
Well, if it isn't, it will be.
>>>
2015-02-03 * 
Pointy-Haired Boss Becomes CEO.
>>> Boss: <<<
We're going into the evil robot business. We'll sell robots that psychologically manipulate their owners into buying unnecessary upgrades.
>>> Evil Robot: <<<
Your neighbor got titanium bolts for his robot. I guess that's what winners do. But your way is good, too.
>>>
2015-02-02 * 
Catbert: <<<
Our CEO is missing, so I am activating the succession plan. You're our new CEO. The power will corrupt you in 3... 2... There it is. (The boss changes into a smelly monster)
2015-02-01 * 
Boss: <<<
To be perfectly honest...
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Wait! Why do you need to say you're being honest in this particular case? You're implying that you've lied to me so often in the past that this one instance of honesty is noteworthy. That is tantamount to admitting you have no respect for me as a human being. And you don't even have the decency to hide your evil in a competent fashion! Do you think I'm such an idiot that I wouldn't notice your verbal assault on my intelligence? Okay, let's hear the one honest thing you have ever told me. Go.
>>> Boss: <<<
This is going to be the easiest lie I've ever told.
>>>
2015-01-31 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Our CEO Bought a Russian military dolphin for his daughter's pool party and it killed a party clown. Then it stole a smartphone and hired Dogbert to put a hit on the CEO so the dolphin...
>>> Garbage Man: <<<
That's way too much exposition.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
...fill the CEO's mansion with water and live in it forever.
>>>
2015-01-30 * 
CEO: <<<
I bought a Russian military dolphin for a pet and it killed a party clown at my daughter's pool party. I need you to dispose of the body.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
The good news is that I'm an expert at getting rid of dead bodies.
>>> CEO: <<<
What's the bad news?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Your dolphin hired me to kill you.
>>>
2015-01-29 * 
CEO: <<<
I bought a dolphin for my daughter's birthday party. But it turned out to be a retired Russian military dolphin. It dragged one of the birthday clowns into the pool and drowned him.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I though dolphins need to live in seawater.
>>> CEO: <<<
Maybe that's why it's so angry.
>>>
2015-01-28 * 
Wally: <<<
Success is all about who you know. I'm not successful, so apparently it doesn't help to know you.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm sorry I let you down.
>>> Wally: <<<
It's as if you aren't even trying.
>>>
2015-01-27 * 
Boss: <<<
It takes money to make money.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Then... where did the first money come from?
>>> Boss: <<<
God?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Don't let him hear doubt in your voice.
>>>
2015-01-26 * 
Boss: <<<
What phase is your project in?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
This is the phase where people ask stupid questions.
>>> Boss: <<<
How long does it last?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It isn't looking good for today.
>>>
2015-01-25 * 
Wally: <<<
I'm already useless, but I'm thinking about becoming toxic as well.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That seems ambitious for you.
>>> Wally: <<<
Think it through. As a useless person, I still get invited to meetings because I don't cause much trouble. But if I go full-toxic, no one will invite me to meetings in the first place. I can avoid a lot of work by nipping it in the bud.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is it hard to be toxic? How do you do it?
>>> Wally: <<<
It's easy. All you do is provide incomplete information that makes people anxious and hateful. I can't tell you what was said in that last meeting, but I defended you.
>>>
2015-01-24 * 
Coworker: <<<
You know how studies always say one out of ten people have a particular problem. I'm always that guy. Statistically speaking, I keep nine people safe just by existing.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's not how statistics work.
>>> Coworker: <<<
And... everyone else in the department knows that?
>>>
2015-01-23 * 
Boss: <<<
A global survey says only 13% of employees feel engaged at work.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
If you're wondering which one of your employees is engaged, it's this guy.
>>> Boss: <<<
We need ten more just like him.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I think I just figured out what's wrong with the rest of us.
>>>
2015-01-22 * 
Wally: <<<
I heard you invented a selfie camera for car steering wheels.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Not exactly. I invented an ion-powered flying car, but all anyone cares about is the selfie camera in the steering wheel.
>>> Wally: <<<
Can you share the selfies on Facebook?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Gaaa!
>>>
2015-01-21 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I designed a flying car that harvests ions from the air to power itself. We can build them for only $3,000 apiece.
>>> CEO: <<<
There's no market for ion-powered flying cars.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I can put a selfie camera in the steering wheel.
>>> CEO: <<<
Much better. And let' say the car does not fly.
>>>
2015-01-20 * 
CEO: <<<
The board is getting on me for not having a succession plan. Find me a loser who is so incompetent that the board won't want to fire me.
>>> Boss: <<<
It's an honor to even be considered!
>>> Catbert: <<<
I was going to say that!
>>>
2015-01-19 * 
Boss: <<<
Are you interested in becoming a manager?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That would never work. Managers are supposed to hire people who are smarter than they are. That's easy for you, but how would I ever find anyone to hire?
>>> Boss: <<<
I don't understand.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
And that makes you the perfect manager.
>>>
2015-01-18 * 
Dilbert: <<<
That isn't in my job description.
>>> Boss: <<<
What?! You should never tell your boss that a task isn't in your job description! It makes you sound like a whiney quitter instead of a resourceful entrepreneur. And don't forget all the personal growth that comes from taking on new challenges. Think outside the box. That is the key to greatness.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So, according to you, the best way to achieve greatness is by assigning the wrong people to tasks? Are there any other dumb things I need to do to achieve greatness or is one thing enough?
>>> Catbert: <<<
Did you find someone to mow your lawn yet?
>>> Boss: <<<
Almost. He's putting up a fight.
>>>
2015-01-17 * 
Boss: <<<
We're looking for employees who are fierce!
>>> Applicant: <<<
Should I punch you or something? I don't know how to play this.
>>> Boss: <<<
Try acting normal, but angrier.
>>>
2015-01-16 * 
CEO: <<<
The quality we look for in our employees is "super pumpedness."
>>> Alice: <<<
Blechhhh!!! I told you to bring a bag.
>>>
2015-01-15 * 
Boss: <<<
I keep saying leader-ish things, but the employees are still terrible.
>>> Catbert: <<<
Try using this hickory branch as a wand.
>>> Boss: <<<
Qualitos improvimentus!
>>> Wally: <<<
I'll be on the Harry Potter.
>>>
2015-01-14 * 
Coworker: <<<
Wally, did you finish the...
>>> Wally: <<<
Get off my back! Why can't you just trust me to do my work on time?!?!
>>> Coworker: <<<
Sorry...
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Who were you yelling at?
>>> Wally: <<<
Beats me. It didn't seem important.
>>>
2015-01-13 * 
Boss: <<<
I forget why I walked over here.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Were you planning to spew empty jargon in my direction to create the illusion of leadership?
>>> Boss: <<<
Oh, right. But now it feels as if the moment has passed.
>>>
2015-01-12 * 
Catbert: <<<
Your co-workers are complaining that your tube clothes distract them from work.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I can make some modifications so I'm less sexy. That should cut down on the distraction.
>>> Catbert: <<<
We might not be on the same page.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I could wear a corduroy tube. That's a libido killer.
>>>
2015-01-11 * 
Wally: <<<
Asok, the key to winning at your job is the taper.
>>> Asok: <<<
Taper?
>>> Wally: <<<
At the start of any new job, you want to put in long hours and create a good first impression. Then you should start to gradually taper off your effort. But be sure you taper slowly. You don't want to be obvious.
>>> Boss: <<<
Wally, is it my imagination, or are you working slightly less every day?
>>> Wally: <<<
It only looks that way because I'm working smarter, not harder. Just the way you taught me.
>>> Boss: <<<
Okay, that sounds right.
>>> Wally: <<<
Always keep that round in the chamber.
>>> Asok: <<<
You scare me, but in a good way.
>>>
2015-01-10 * 
Alice: <<<
I only slept three hours last night.
>>> Topper: <<<
That's nothing! I used kunk fu to divert an asteroid that was on a collision course with Earth.
>>> Alice: <<<
Topping needs to be in the same category!
>>> Topper: <<<
Only if you're bad at it! Hoo-ha!
>>>
2015-01-09 * 
Woman: <<<
I want a guy who loves me for me, and not for the way I look... or the things I do.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That doesn't leave me much to work with. Can I love you for your money and your vanilla-scented body lotion?
>>> Woman: <<<
You could love me for my mind.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That might have worked two minutes ago.
>>>
2015-01-08 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I discovered that I can wear my tube clothing in the shower! It's like doing laundry and taking a shower at the same time! I can add one more efficiency, but I'd need to replumb the shower drain.
>>> Tina: <<<
Please stop talking!!!
>>>
2015-01-07 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Tube clothes! I invented that style! Did it reduce the number of decisions you need to make every day?
>>> Man: <<<
I'm just a guy wrapped in a carpet.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Oh, I thought you were like me.
>>> Man: <<<
I don't have to take these insults.
>>>
2015-01-06 * 
Woman: <<<
I want to be in a serious relationship that can lead to marriage.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Marriage is a financial contract. How much money do you have?
>>> Woman: <<<
All I have is me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So... more vendor than spouse?
>>>
2015-01-05 * 
Woman: <<<
Have you been dating a lot?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I call it A-B testing. I go on dates and then compare the analytics to see who I click with most.Woman: What exactly are you measuring?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Asks too many questions.
>>>
2015-01-04 * 
Boss: <<<
That doesn't sound like a work call.
>>> Carol: <<<
It isn't I don't have time to do my personal stuff on my own time. I have to do it on work time.
>>> Boss: <<<
I pay you to do work stuff, not personal stuff.
>>> Carol: <<<
Then how would I get all of my personal stuff done?
>>> Boss: <<<
That's not my problem.
>>> Carol: <<<
Then why did you bring it up.
>>> Boss: <<<
Because I need you to do work.
>>> Carol: <<<
I told you I can't get all of my personal stuff done if I do your work!
>>> Boss: <<<
Okay, okay. I probably could have handled that better.
>>>
2015-01-03 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I'm starting to realize that my market value as a single guy is higher than I thought. Men such as you have set the bar so low that all I need to do is have a job and be taller than most women in heels. I thought they were turned on by my tube clothing, but they actually like me for me.
>>> Wally: <<<
You're welcome.
>>>
2015-01-02 * 
Woman: <<<
Mom, this my date, Dilbert. He only wears tube clothes.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
For the efficiency. Whoa! Before I touch that paw, have you been to any Ebola hot spots lately?
>>> Woman: <<<
He has a job.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
My time has come!
>>>
2015-01-01 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I noticed you eyeing my tube clothes. You're thinking I am a man who values substance over style and it turns you on.
>>> Woman: <<<
No, I'm thinking I'll date anything that has a job.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I have one of those!
>>>
2014-12-31 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I got 9,752 responses on this dating site and I haven't even completed my profile. All I said is that I'm six feet tall, I have hair and a job. Meanwhile, everywhere: Women: Hair... height... job! Triple threat!
>>>
2014-12-30 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I only wear tube clothes now because it reduces my number of daily decisions.
>>> Tina: <<<
You mean decisions such as... where to go on a date? Because I don't see that coming up.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm still fine-tuning the system.
>>>
2014-12-29 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I call my invention <<<
tube clothes.
>>> The idea is to eliminate as many daily decisions as possible, the way Mark Zuckerberg does with his gray t-shirt. I like to understand what makes people successful.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
And you narrowed it down to his shirt?
>>>
2014-12-28 * 
CEO: <<<
You didn't promptly respond to my email last night.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You sent that email at 1 a.m.
>>> CEO: <<<
I expect my employees to be checking email at all times.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Sleep is necessary for normal brain function. Anyone who succumbs to your leadership on this topic will turn into a dysfunctional moron in 48 hours.
>>> CEO: <<<
I don't see where you're going with this. It's all so confusing to my brain. So tired... can't stay awake...
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I don't  usually win conversations this decisively.

2014-12-27 * 
Dilbert: <<<
We found the "bliss point" for immersive 3-D headgear. The product is so good that 87% of our customers starved to death while using it.
>>> CEO: <<<
We never get the customer retention part right.
>>>
2014-12-26 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Hey, Ted, how do you like our new 3-D immersive goggles you've been testing for two weeks? Some people say the experience is so good that you forget to eat. You're dead, aren't you...
>>>
2014-12-25 * 
Boss: <<<
I only have enough in the budget to hire an employee who is incompetent half of the time. But if I don't use the budget, I will lose those funds next year.
>>> Employee: <<<
And I am proud to say that I'm 75% competent.
>>> Boss: <<<
I wish I could afford that.
>>>
2014-12-24 * 
Tina: <<<
What are you talking about? It sounds interesting.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
We were saying that our smartphone technology has caused us to speed-evolve into a meta-organism that is the sum of our connected parts.
>>> Tina: <<<
In my defense, from across the room it looked interesting.
>>>

Carol: <<<
Warren Buffett says my career will be better if I show passion for my job. I'll have to fake the passion because everything I do in this job is mindless and boring. Later.
>>> Carol: <<<
Woo-hoo! I forwarded an email!
>>>
2014-12-22 * 
Boss: <<<
You need to show more leadership on your project.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How do you know my leadership is a problem? Maybe the team members are bad followers.
>>> Boss: <<<
It's your job to fix it either way.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
The way you just fixed me with your leadership?
>>>
2014-12-21 * 
Coworker: <<<
I should warn you that I'm a perfectionist.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I appreciate the warning. Do you have any other psychological problems or just the one?
>>> Coworker: <<<
I don't think of it as a "problem."
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I guess that's what makes it so bad. I see a lot of other psychological problems in your writing. Cognitive dissonance, unrealistic optimism, and some projection bias. But I can see why you think your perfectionism is the worst part.
>>> Coworker: <<<
You're a jerk.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
...and here come the anger issues.
>>>
2014-12-20 * 
Tina: <<<
I heard you had a freak accident while vacuuming your house naked.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's a rumor. I don't know how that stuff spreads.
>>> Tina: <<<
Now I feel a little bad that I told thirty people.
>>>
2014-12-19 * 
Carol: <<<
Dilbert called to say he'd be late for your meeting. He said something about having a freak accident while vacuuming naked.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Did you tell him traffic was bad?
>>> Carol: <<<
More or less.
>>>
2014-12-18 * 
The Marketing Guy. Marketing Guy: <<<
I don't see why engineers get paid more than marketing professionals.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Maybe because engineers designed and built every important part of modern civilization and all you did was misrepresent it.
>>> Marketing Guy: <<<
My point is that you need both.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You really don't.
>>>
2014-12-17 * 
Wally: <<<
I'm thinking of getting into the strategic planning game. If I understand the job description, you basically hallucinate about the future and then something different happens.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You also have to pretend it's useful.
>>> Wally: <<<
Really? That sounds hard.
>>>
2014-12-16 * 
Financial Advisor. Advisor: <<<
Convertible notes... preferred stock... municipal bonds... covered call options. These are things you can never hope to understand. So trust me and try to forget that my only career ambition is to drain your account like a giant mosquito.
>>> Boss: <<<
That sounds reasonable.
>>> Advisor: <<<
I'm always surprised at how easy this is.
>>>
2014-12-15 * 
Financial Advisor. Dilbert: <<<
You kept me waiting in the lobby for five minutes. So I used that time to learn everything that matters in the field of personal investing. Did you know that you don't know much?
>>> Financial Advisor: <<<
I did not know that.

What's it like to work hard? I'm curious because the reward for hard work seems to be identical to the reward for pretending to work. It seems as if it would be demotivating to work so hard for no incremental benefit. If I had to pick one word to describe my day, it would be <<<
relaxing.
>>> But you took the harder path, and for that, you have my respect.
>>> Alice: <<<
I don't want the respect of a loser!
>>> Wally: <<<
If it makes you feel any better, I don't actually respect hard work.
>>>
2014-12-13 * 
Boss: <<<
Hold on, I have a text message that is probably more important than you. I will demonstrate my power over you by handling a text message while you sit there, waiting for a pellet of my attention. Stop texting me!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Mmm... pellet.
>>>
2014-12-12 * 
Wally: <<<
Here's the analysis you asked me to do.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Oops. I forgot to tell you, I don't need this anymore.
>>> Wally: <<<
What? I did all of that work for nothing?
>>> Coworker: <<<
Wait... this is nothing but... gibberish.
>>> Wally: <<<
That is a separate issue.
>>>
2014-12-11 * 
Wally: <<<
I would love to help you, Alice, but Dilbert says everything you are doing is misguided.
>>> Alice: <<<
What? I will whip him to death with his own intestines!
>>> Wally: <<<
Can you either do that quietly or wait until after my nap time?
>>>
2014-12-10 * 
Wally: <<<
I added air bags to my underpants to avoid accidental assignments.
>>> Boss: <<<
Hey, Wally, I need you to... Maybe I'll ask someone else.
>>> Wally: <<<
The system works!
>>>
2014-12-09 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I don't know how you juggle work plus a family.
>>> Carol: <<<
Spending time with my family is like fighting porcupines in a salt mine. I come here just to get away from them.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So... you like your job?
>>> Carol: <<<
No, but at least I can go home to get away from it.
>>>
2014-12-08 * 
Wally: <<<
If you need me, I'll be in the cloud fixing a software issue. There's no cell coverage in the cloud, so it might seem to you as if I am at home doing nothing. If you need me, I'll be at home doing nothing.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Why would anyone need you?
>>>
2014-12-07 * 
Woman: <<<
I like dancing and...
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm out. I avoid any relationship that has a risk of dancing.
>>> Woman: <<<
You're rejecting me because I like to dance?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Yeah, it would start out all innocent... but two months into it you'd be guzzling wine and dragging me toward live music. Then you'd start doing all this... and this... and some of this...
>>> Woman: <<<
I also enjoy doing yoga to release my chakra energy. Does that bother you?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I think I'm getting hives.
>>>
2014-12-06 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Your rule is that no more than eight people should attend a meeting, so I can't let you sit down.
>>> CEO: <<<
When did I say that?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It was in a book you co-wrote.
>>> CEO: <<<
I knew I should have skimmed that thing.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Your unknown co-author is quite wise.
>>>
2014-12-05 * 
Dinosaur: <<<
Ha ha! I am now the coolest member of the household because I have a smartwatch. Hello, watch. What time is is?
>>> Watch: <<<
This is the anthropocene epoch.
>>> Dinosaur: <<<
Wow, that carbon dates me.
>>>
2014-12-04 * 
Dinosaur: <<<
All I need is my flip phone, my Windows XP, and my basic cable television. Did I sound like a big, dumb dinosaur that time?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Pretty much.
>>> Dinosaur: <<<
Wow... there is no cool way to describe my life.
>>>
2014-12-03 * 
Dinosaur: <<<
I don't own a smartphone. I use a flip phone because it does everything I want.
>>> Alice: <<<
Why are you proud of being a big, dumb dinosaur with a terrible phone?
>>> Dinosaur: <<<
I'm sensing a lot of judgement in that question.
>>> Alice: <<<
Wait until  you hear my follow-ups.
>>>
2014-12-02 * 
Boss: <<<
Do you want some constructive criticism?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No, but I would love some under-informed opinions about things you don't understand.
>>> Boss: <<<
That took a lot of fun out of it.
>>>
2014-12-01 * 
Boss: <<<
I couldn't open the document you sent with your project update.
>>> Wally: <<<
Try erasing your hard disk and reinstalling the operating system.
>>> Boss: <<<
I guess I don't need it that badly.
>>> Wally: <<<
After all the work I put into making that document?
>>>
2014-11-30 * 
Boss: <<<
Would you like some feedback on your performance?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No.
>>> Boss: <<<
You're supposed to appreciate feedback because it makes you feel valued.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How does listening to you belittle me about things you don't understand make me feel valued?
>>> Boss: <<<
Well, I don't know. It must be an indirect thing. Maybe we should just try it and see how it feels.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Whatever.
>>> Boss: <<<
I don't actually watch you work, so I'm mostly guessing about the things you do wrong. I accuse you of being slow and disorganized! Is it working yet?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Yes. If that makes you go away.
>>>
2014-11-29 * 
Alice: <<<
I feel so rested and relaxed after my vacation. I wonder how long this afterglow will last because... excuse me while I check this text message.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is it too late to start timing it? [Alice is on fire]
2014-11-28 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Let's skip to the part where I tell you how you should have engineered it instead of whatever you did.
>>> Coworker: <<<
You don't know what I did.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I have five minutes to pretend that matters.
>>> Coworker: <<<
That's all I need.
>>>
2014-11-27 * 
Dilbert: <<<
If our business plan fails, do we have a plan for that?
>>> Boss: <<<
Only losers plan for failure.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I think we're on the same page, but for some reason you're angry about it.
>>>
2014-11-26 * 
Boss: <<<
Are you going to meet the launch deadline?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No. There were unexpected problems.
>>> Boss: <<<
I need solutions, not unexpected problems! Did that mean anything?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Almost. Good try.
>>>
2014-11-25 * 
Dilbert: <<<
And I plan to launch the beta version in two months.
>>> Group: <<<
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I have a credibility problem.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
And I should believe that?
>>>
2014-11-24 * 
Dilbert: <<<
The good news is that we had the winning bid for the project. The less-good news is that we don't make the product we just sold, nor could we make it for the price we bid. My plan is to put out an RFP to secretly subcontract the work to a bigger liar.
>>> CEO: <<<
That could work.
>>>
2014-11-23 * 
Wally: <<<
Is it okay if I telecommute on "Bring Your Kid To Work" Day? I'll show my kid how I work from home.
>>> Boss: <<<
How would I know you were working?
>>> Wally: <<<
What??!! That is exactly the sort of distrust that corrodes the motivation of employees! How can I feel good about my job in this toxic atmosphere?
>>> Boss: <<<
Okay, okay. You can work from home on "Bring Your Kid To Work" Day.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You don't have a kid.
>>> Wally: <<<
I hear they ruin your naps.
>>>
2014-11-22 * 
Dilbert:I'm hitting a snag with this RFP because our products don't do what they need. Should I give up and accept failure or lie about our features and transfer the problem to them?
>>> Boss: <<<
My daddy used to say it isn't a problem if you can give it to someone else.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Then he drove you to school?
>>>
2014-11-21 * 
CEO: <<<
Good news! I got rehired as CEO! I checked the security videos for the day I got fired, and not I'm getting revenge on anyone who did a happy dance.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Did I...?
>>> CEO: <<<
Frankly, I can't tell. Do you have spasms?
>>>
2014-11-20 * 
Dogbert the CEO. Catbert: <<<
The board has approved a $100 million golden parachute if you quit now.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
$100 million?!!! How am I supposed to live on that? You insult me!
>>> Catbert: <<<
That's a lot of money for doing nothing.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Bah! I spend more than that on soft cheese.
>>>
2014-11-19 * 
Dogbert the CEO. Dogbert: <<<
I will give you 10% of my annual pay if you do 100% of my job for me. 10% of my pay as CEO is still a lot of money.
>>> Wally: <<<
I'll do it. I'll give you 10% of what he's paying me if you do 100% of his work plus mine. It's still a lot of money.
>>> Asok: <<<
I'm in!
>>>
2014-11-18 * 
Dogbert the Co-CEO.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I have bad news. Your Co-CEO died trying to kitesurf some class 6 rapids for a publicity stunt.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Get to the bad part. Is it margins?
>>>
2014-11-17 * 
Co-CEOs.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Let's split the duties this way... I will be the CEO who attends boring meetings, and you can be more of a Richard Branson type who does dangerous publicity stunts. Co-CEO: I love that idea.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
And then there was one.
>>>
2014-11-16 * 
Boss: <<<
You haven't achieved any of your goals for the year. What is up with that?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Do you want an explanation that goes back to the root cause?
>>> Boss: <<<
Of course.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
The problem started years ago, when two idiots unwisely created a third smaller idiot. They compounded their mistake with bad parenting. The toddler ate candy and sniffed wet paint until he became a pointy-headed boss. The pointy-headed boss set goals for his underlings that ignored the rapidly evolving nature of the industry. Then he got angry at his most talented employee for giving an accurate answer to a question.
>>> Boss: <<<
I hate you.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Nothing could halt the downward spiral.
>>>
2014-11-15 * 
CEO: <<<
I hired a co-CEO, but it isn't working because we disagree on everything. We want to hire you as our third CEO so we always have a tiebreaker.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I accept. The new guy and I have decided to fire you and split the CEO spot two ways.
>>>
2014-11-14 * 
CEO: <<<
I decided to hire a co-CEO to share the job with me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I assume you know that having a co-CEO does not mean you get paid the same while working half as much.
>>> CEO: <<<
Can I fire you? Co-CEO: No, we need a third CEO to break the tie.
>>>
2014-11-13 * 
Boss: <<<
I need you to organize some sort of memorial thing for Fred.
>>> Carol: <<<
You mean Ted.
>>> Boss: <<<
I'm thinking cake and balloons in the break room. Is that tasteful enough?
>>> Carol: <<<
I could hire a mime to pretend he's in an invisible box.
>>>
2014-11-12 * 
Boss: <<<
We mourn the untimely passing of our beloved colleague, Fred. We will never forget him.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It was Ted, not Fred.
>>> Boss: <<<
Was he beloved?
>>> Wally: <<<
I don't remember. It was like a week ago.
>>>
2014-11-11 * 
Catbert: <<<
Ted retired yesterday and dropped dead this morning. You worked him to death with perfect timing. Nicely done/ Unless it was just a coincidence.
>>> Boss: <<<
If I'm being honest, hitting the exact day was just luck.
>>>
2014-11-10 * 
CEO: <<<
We can only succeed if we work harder than our competitors! Oops, gotta go. My helicopter is here to take me to my massage appointment on my superyacht. Stop staring at me. I only have to work harder than other CEOs.
>>>
2014-11-09 * 
CEO: <<<
The company has two exciting announcements. We are launching a new artificial meat product. In unrelated news, our manufacturing plant is now fully automated by robots. Wow. It got quiet in here.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I don't want to say we have no trust in senior management, but... did you order the robots to kill all of the manufacturing employees and turn them into a meat product?
>>> CEO: <<<
Before I answer that, can we agree that capitalism has some rough edges?
>>>
2014-11-08 * 
Asok: <<<
Is it my imagination or is there no career path here from intern to anything else?  Catbert: If we promote you, we just have to find another intern. No one wins in that scenario.
>>> Asok: <<<
Actually, I would be the winner in that scenario.
>>> Catbert: <<<
I've never thought of it that way and I don't like it.
>>>
2014-11-07 * 
Catbert: <<<
Egyptian pharaohs killed the engineers who build their pyramids so they would never share their secrets.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No... I don't think they did.
>>> Catbert: <<<
Really? Dang! Can we reschedule this meeting until I find a historically accurate explanation of our new policy?
>>>
2014-11-06 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I discovered a unique sequence of sights and sounds that makes people buy things they don't need. I recommend that we destroy all of my lab notes and rid the world of this evil tool.
>>> CEO: <<<
You never told him what marketing is?
>>> Boss: <<<
He didn't need to know.
>>>
2014-11-05 * 
Catbert: <<<
Our sales dropped to zero because you told the media we have a better product coming soon. And 95% of the staff resigned because you announced plans to fire 50% of them. Maybe it would be better if you never spoke to anyone again.
>>> CEO: <<<
How would people get my wisdom.
>>>
2014-11-04 * 
CEO: <<<
Our sales for the quarter are zero. Because I might have mentioned on CNBC that we have a better, cheaper model coming soon. So... great job on the new product... and I need to fire half of you so it looks as if I do things.
>>> Voice: <<<
What is your home address?
>>>
2014-11-03 * 
Phil: <<<
I am Phil, The Prince of Insufficient Light. I got a report that you wished bad karma upon your co-workers.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You would put off a more menacing vibe if you didn't have leftover cereal in your pitchspoon.
>>> Phil: <<<
I was really hungry and I didn't feel like emptying the dishwasher.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
We've all been there.
>>>
2014-11-02 * 
Boss: <<<
The key to good time management is touching each piece of paper once. If I can only touch it once, I'd better do it right. I'll need to make sure I don't get interrupted after the first touch.Turn off my phone, close my door, and ignore email. Okay, here goes one touch. Ugh. This will take an hour and I only have ten minutes. Make a copy, throw away the original, and don't let me touch the copy until I have an hour in my schedule. I wonder if I'm allowed to use salad tongs.
>>>
2014-11-01 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I would like to thank each of you for playing with your phones and not listening to a word I said all meeting. I hope karma is a real thing and frozen lavatory debris from airplanes kills each of you.
>>> Alice: <<<
What was he going on about?
>>> Wally: <<<
Beats me. I'm not much of a multitasker.
>>>
2014-10-31 * 
Inexperienced Guy. Coworker: <<<
Can you answer some questions about our product prototype?
>>> Alice: <<<
No, but I would be happy to strangle you with your own lanyard and put your corpse in my boss' Escalade to frame him for the crime.
>>> Coworker: <<<
That scenario is alarmingly specific.
>>> Alice: <<<
For this sort of thing, premeditated is the way to go.
>>>
2014-10-30 * 
Inexperienced Guy. Boss: <<<
Put together a deck showing the minimum viable product feature list.
>>> Employee: <<<
What is a deck? What is a minimum viable product? How would I know what the features are?
>>> Boss: <<<
I have no respect for people who ask questions.
>>> Employee: <<<
First day, not good.
>>>
2014-10-29 * 
Alice: <<<
I'm trying to turn myself into a morning person so I can be more productive. I've been getting up at 4:30 every day, and so far, so good.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So... no problems at all?
>>> Alice: <<<
Nothing huge. I've brushed my teeth with face cream a few times.
>>>
2014-10-28 * 
Coworker: <<<
Three months. That's how long I have been waiting for you to do your part of the project.
>>> Wally: <<<
Perhaps you don't realize how many projects I'm on.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Have you done any work for the other projects?
>>> Wally: <<<
That would defeat the point of having multiple projects.
>>>
2014-10-27 * 
Graphic Designer. Dilbert: <<<
I'll do some A-B testing with the design options you provided. Interestingly, the fact that you can't predict which design will perform best means your skill set is mostly random behavior that you package as talent.
>>> Designer: <<<
This works better if i'm the only one who knows that.
>>>
2014-10-26 * 
Wally: <<<
Studies show that continually checking email lowers your functional I.Q. You advised me to <<<
work smarter,
>>> so I plan to ignore all of your email from now on.
>>> Boss: <<<
What if I text you instead?
>>> Wally: <<<
That's the sort of question that one asks after checking email too often.
>>> Boss: <<<
Did you just insult me?
>>> Wally: <<<
That answer is in your email.
>>> Boss: <<<
Where is it? I don't see any email from you. But I see six new emails that look important. What were we talking about.
>>> Wally: <<<
You were complimenting me on my efficiency.
>>>
2014-10-25 * 
Boss: <<<
Dilbert, meet our new graphic designer.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
If I had your job, I would secretly sub it out to strangers on the Internet and pay them 5% of my salary while I did nothing all day. Oops, sorry. I didn't know you were already there.
>>>
2014-10-24 * 
Boss: <<<
The new business school rankings are out.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is that the list that is based on the votes of people who have no direct knowledge of those schools?
>>> Boss: <<<
You ruin everything.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Context is not your friend.
>>>
2014-10-23 * 
Alice: <<<
I met with that angel investor at his house and he answered the door pantsless and drunk. So I snapped a few photos with my phone and secured a million-dollar seed investment. Was that wrong?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Let's call it a tie.
>>>
2014-10-22 * 
Alice: <<<
An angel investor agreed to meet with me about my start-up idea.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You need to be careful because he might be...
>>> Alice: <<<
We're meeting for drinks at his house on Saturday night.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm socially inept and even I know that sounds wrong.
>>> Alice: <<<
He keeps texting to say he can't wait to fund me.
>>>
2014-10-21 * 
Boss: <<<
Did you have any problems filling in for me while I was on vacation?
>>> Robot: <<<
It was hard at first. I couldn't tell who was lying about doing a spectacular job.
>>> Boss: <<<
That's why I reward them randomly.
>>> Robot: <<<
I tried that and it did seem to settle them down.
>>>
2014-10-20 * 
Temporary Robot Boss. Robot: <<<
Is it just my simulated imagination or are all of the employees lying to me all the time?
>>> Catbert: <<<
We trained them to be that way by punishing honesty.
>>> Robot: <<<
How is you project coming along?
>>> Alice: <<<
100% perfect! Couldn't be better!
>>>
2014-10-19 * 
Boss: <<<
Robots are a clever novelty, but they will never be intelligent like humans.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What would be an example of something your brain can do that a robot can't imitate?
>>> Boss: <<<
Well, for example, I can tell when a movie is good.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
If that were intelligence, all smart people would like the same movies.
>>> Boss: <<<
Well, I can also read human faces to know what people are feeling.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What am I feeling right now?
>>> Boss: <<<
I'm picking up a mixture of admiration, arousal, and thoughts of bacon.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Don't get cocky, but you won this round.
>>>
2014-10-18 * 
Temporary Robot Boss. Robot: <<<
My sensors detect no work coming from this cubicle.
>>> Wally: <<<
That's because I have been working on an engineering problem in my head for five years.
>>> Robot: <<<
Are you almost done?
>>> Wally: <<<
I was, but you just made me forget all of it.
>>>
2014-10-17 * 
Temporary Robot Boss. Robot: <<<
I have come to micromanage you. But only until I replace you with a robot and turn you into furniture.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
On the plus side, he has a plan and he communicates well.
>>>
2014-10-16 * 
Boss: <<<
Our robot will be sitting in for me while I'm on vacation. I hope you can get used to taking orders from a soulless creature of questionable intelligence.
>>> Wally: <<<
I think I can do that.  Boss: That's the spirit!
>>>
2014-10-15 * 
Boss: <<<
You two have failed to meet your project milestones.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's because you paired me with a toxic moron who is incapable of having an original thought.
>>> Coworker: <<<
That happened to me, too.
>>>
2014-10-14 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Hey, it's the first day of our new dress code and we wore exactly the same outfits!
>>> Alice: <<<
If you ever say that again I will rip out your tongue and use it to slap you to death.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is it because I wore it better?
>>>
2014-10-13 * 
Dilbert: <<<
This is our new company dress code. We call it "Business Dorky."
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I like it because it makes you look powerless, boring, and sexually irrelevant.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
They make me wear this badge so I don't look like an asexual trespasser.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Accessories make the outfit.
>>>
2014-10-12 * 
Coworker: <<<
The software upgrade will be written and rolled out in three months.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Has any project of this complexity ever been completed by the estimated finish date?
>>> Coworker: <<<
Not yet. We're confident we'll be the first.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is that because you're doing things differently from all of those who went before and failed?
>>> Coworker: <<<
No. We're doing things exactly the same way as the people who failed.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Do you see what I'm getting at?
>>> Coworker: <<<
No, not really. And we expect to be on budget.
>>> Wally: <<<
Snork!
>>>
2014-10-11 * 
Catbert: <<<
Our new dress code is <<<
Business Dorky.
>>> Your clothes must be dorky, unstylish, and 50% tan colored.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So... business casual?
>>> Catbert: <<<
That's a dumb name for it.
>>>
2014-10-10 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Did you see the article on the Internet about the five signs you might be a bad boss?
>>> Boss: <<<
Yeah. About seventy people forwarded it to me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That was number three on the list.
>>> Boss: <<<
I didn't read it.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That was number one.
>>>
2014-10-09 * 
Catbert: <<<
I'm getting complaints that you've been trash-talking employees' families so they'll spend more time at work. I stopped by to give you a high-five from Human Resources. Your aim is terrible.
>>> Boss: <<<
The first one was practice~
2014-10-08 * 
Boss: <<<
Carol, I know it isn't easy balancing your work duties and your family. So I thought it would help if I trash-talk your family. That way you won't feel so guilty when you ignore them to do my busywork. I'll start with your husband.
>>> Carol: <<<
Don't bother. I got that one covered.
>>>
2014-10-07 * 
Dilbert: <<<
They say curiosity is a sign of a nimble intellect.
>>> Boss: <<<
Curiosity killed the cat.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That evidence was anecdotal, but I still found it compelling.
>>>
2014-10-06 * 
Boss: <<<
My neck is killing me. I must have slept wrong.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Ha ha ha! You can't even sleep right! I'm doing you a favor because laughter is the best medicine. Hee hee!
>>> Boss: <<<
Why does that no longer sound wise?!!
>>>
2014-10-05 * 
Dilbert: <<<
You have an interesting choice today. You can continue bullying me into working sixty hours per week... while knowing that fatigue will lower the quality of  my work. Or you can be an enlightened leader and encourage me to work fewer hours for a better net outcome.
>>> Boss: <<<
I'm not supposed to tell you this, but... leadership is an illusion created by the abuse of underlings. The more pain I force you to endure, the more of a leader I appear to be. How's the truth feel?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
>>>
2014-10-04 * 
Wally: <<<
I'm pretending to be a workaholic so the company will pay for rehab. Waaaa!!! I am working too hard! It is starting to affect my health!
>>> Boss: <<<
That seemed a bit dramatic.
>>> Wally: <<<
Here we go with blaming the victim.
>>>
2014-10-03 * 
Wally: <<<
If I become a workaholic, will the company pay for rehab?
>>> Boss: <<<
What would workaholics rehab look like?
>>> Wally: <<<
I hope it involves getting paid while doing no work.
>>> Boss: <<<
That's what you do now.
>>> Wally: <<<
At rehab I think they do your laundry for you.
>>>
2014-10-02 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I heard a rumor of a reorganization. Is it true?
>>> Boss: <<<
Who told you that?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Answering a question with a question means yes.
>>> Boss: <<<
Are you accusing me of being a deceptive weasel?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Why would you ask that?
>>>
2014-10-01 * 
Boss: <<<
I can tell a lot from an applicant's storytelling skills. So tell me a story.
>>> Man: <<<
Last week, I broke into a morgue and took a selfie with a dead guy. But in my defense, I was super drunk.
>>> Boss: <<<
I hired a new salesperson.
>>>
2014-09-30 * 
Larry: <<<
Hi, I'm Larry. I was hired because I'm a good cultural fit. I hope we can get past the stigma that cultural hires are incompetent. But I don't know how to do that.
>>> Alice: <<<
Maybe you could ask a competent person to help you.

Boss: <<<
Dilbert, meet Larry. He isn't terribly competent, but he's a good cultural fit.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Hi, Larry. Thanks for reinforcing our culture of incompetence.
>>> Larry: <<<
You're joking about the incompetence, right.
>>> Boss: <<<
Sure.

Boss: <<<
You've been named worst employee of the month. The honor comes with a special parking spot. It's under the big tree that every bird in the county uses as a restroom. By the end of the day, you'll need a fireman's axe just to find the door handle. As you chop your way toward the inner core that is your car, think about how you could have worked harder this month. You'll probably draw a crowd in the parking lot so remember to wallow in your shame.
>>> Wally: <<<
I take mass transit to work.
>>> Boss: <<<
Incentives don't work.

2014-09-27 * 
Dilbert: <<<
My best ideas are trapped in my head. Whenever I voice my ideas, I attract haters like zombies to fish sticks.
>>> Wally: <<<
IS that analogy one of your great ideas?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I don't like the way you asked that.
>>>
2014-09-26 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I have too many projects. I'm freaking out.
>>> Boss: <<<
Experts say you should tackle the most unpleasant tasks first, so you have a feeling of accomplishment and control.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Now I have too many projects and some extra anxiety that I'm doing them in the wrong order.
>>> Boss: <<<
Off you go.
>>>
2014-09-25 * 
Boss: <<<
I need your opinion before I make a decision.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Studies show that if you ask for my opinion, I will no longer perceive you as a leader.
>>> Boss: <<<
And if I do not ask for your opinion?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I would perceive you as an idiot and a leader.
>>>
2014-09-24 * 
CEO: <<<
The secret to being a great leader is to zig when others zag.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Coincidentally, that is the same strategy used by the insane.
>>> CEO: <<<
I should fire you for your insubordination.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Or you could zig.

No one looks at resumes anymore. Now we use special algorithms to see where your personality fits in our culture.

That process sounds like a steaming pile of stupidity that will beat itself to death in a few years.
>>> Catbert: <<<
I'll start you in engineering. You'll fit right in.

2014-09-22 * 
Catbert: <<<
Your experience is impressive, but a better predictor of success is your cognitive control. I will leave you for ten minutes with a donut, a laptop full of inappropriate videos, and a bottle of vodka. Try to resist them.

Yee-ha! Mmm-mm!

Do not go in there.

Boss: <<<
Make a PowerPoint deck showing our progress on Project Unicorn.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
There hasn't been any progress.
>>> Boss: <<<
That's okay. Use a large font.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Style is not a substitute for substance.
>>> Boss: <<<
You're thinking like a worker bee. There's no time for substance when you're at the top. Executives only respond to familiar colors and shapes. Clouds, dollar signs... that sort of thing.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
...and in conclusion.
>>> Boss: <<<
Come on slow clap.
>>>
2014-09-20 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I was named one of the sexiest engineers in the world!
>>> Dogbert: <<<
That honor sounds like a practical joke perpetrated by an evil genius who cleverly concealed his true identity.

Nah.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
And I bet he likes to sit on rocks.

2014-09-19 * 
Tina: <<<
You have been named one of the sexiest engineers in the world. At the risk of sounding unkind, the competition was not fierce.

Being a leader is a lonely job.

Try being less of a #!@*. Then people might want to spend time with you.
>>> CEO: <<<
I don't see how that could work.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Can we get back to manipulating my emotions for financial gain?
>>>
2014-09-17 * 
CEO: <<<
A good leader has to be willing to be disliked.

You must be a great leader.

Sorry. I didn't expect you to be listening to me.

Boss: <<<
I dislike the words "boss" and "employee." From now on, we are all "team members." I'll be the team member that makes the decisions and gets paid the most. You'll be the team members I punish when things go wrong.

But otherwise we are all equal?

Whoa! Calm down, Spartacus.

2014-09-14 * 
Boss: <<<
Alice, people are uncomfortable with your communication style.
>>> Alice: <<<
Did someone complain?
>>> Boss: <<<
No, I'm picking it up in their body language.
>>> Alice: <<<
So.. people have bad posture and that means I don't say things right?
>>> Boss: <<<
Call it a gut feeling.
>>> Alice: <<<
Ohhhh. That sounds rational. Let's toss some feng shui into the equation and maybe get a psychic to contact the dead to see what they say bout me. Or maybe everyone could stop being whiny babies! Oh, wait. I see it now.

Research says that asking for advice doubles your odds of career advancement. Do you think I should get a pet kangaroo?

I don't care if you marry one.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I wonder how long the time lag is until my promotion.
>>>
2014-09-12 * 
Boss: <<<
Asok, the best way to advance your career is by learning as much as you can from co-workers.
>>> Asok: <<<
Can you show me what you are doing?
>>> Alice: <<<
Come back in ten years when I'm not busy.
>>> Asok: <<<
No one will help me learn anything.

You learned that!

Dilbert: <<<
I saw you new car in the parking lot. It's nice.

Thank you.

Well, I guess only one of us knows how to make his own car.

CEO: <<<
You should be proud that we beat the earnings that analysts expected.

Why should we be proud that analysts are bad at making estimates?

Those bad estimated don't happen on their own. I had to mislead them.
>>> Asok: <<<
I'm proud of you.

2014-09-09 * 
Boss: <<<
When you talk to customers, stop mentioning our software bugs.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Should I lie?
>>> Boss: <<<
No, no. I just need you to present the information that is good for us and leave out the rest.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Lie by omission?
>>> Boss: <<<
It's better if we don't label it.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Should I use my real name?

Our ads are so bad that they increase sales for our competitors.

That is the mantra of all defective people.

2014-09-05 * 
CEO: <<<
I don't like the name of our new app. You need to change it.

Perhaps you can underscore your point by suggesting a bunch of names that are already taken. Do you mind if I think of other things while you do that?
>>>
2014-09-04 * 
Employee: <<<
Heh-heh. I am going to speak my mind and dump on everyone.

Give me our I.D. and get out. If anyone wanted your opinion I would have paid you enough to stay.

Coworker: <<<
This is my last day of work, so I won't have time to completely train you on the software. But I can show you enough to give you unwarranted confidence, when you should be feeling dangerously incompetent.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That sounds worse than doing nothing.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Before I leave, I'll tell everyone you're lazy.

2014-09-02 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Now, I give you the dance of the adequate. I am adequate, yes, I am. Oooh, so adequate. As long as I avoid contact with others.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
You are so lame!
>>>
2014-09-01 * 
Catbert: <<<
My job in Human Resources is to instill in you a permanent feeling of inadequacy. Your only hope for feeling good about yourself is to work feverishly to boos company profits. If you work all weekend for free, I am willing to call you adequate on a temporary basis.

I'll take it.

I need you to co-author a book on success with me. The goal is to make readers believe success comes from hard work and wise decisions. So instead of hating me for being lucky, they will hate themselves for being lazy and dumb.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
And for buying your book?
>>>
2014-08-29 * 
Wally: <<<
Asok, the key to success is not caring what others think of you. Coincidentally, that is also the key to being totally useless. The important thing is that other people can't tell which way you're hoping it goes.

Wally: <<<
He transferred all of his mental energy to the executive attention network of his brain to solve a problem. This is dangerous territory for an engineer because it suppresses the last remnants of his social awareness. Expect him to misread social cues.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
They're here to kill me.
>>>
2014-08-27 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I have to warn you that I'll be going deep on a technology problem today. I'll be using the executive attention network of my brain at the expense of my social awareness.
>>> Boss: <<<
Sounds like a radical change.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I can't tell if that was sarcasm.
>>>
2014-08-26 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Experts say you need a great team to get great results. We're going to prove them wrong because our team is an inexperienced intern, a useless guy, a corps in an exoskeleton and me.
>>> Wally: <<<
That conflicts with my plan to prove the experts right.
>>>
2014-08-25 * 
Boss: <<<
This is Barry. He has been working on our exoskeleton project for five years.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Evidently Barry died years ago, and his exoskeleton keeps taking his bones to meetings.

In my defense, that is only obvious after you say it.

I am always tense and I don't know why.

It's the tyranny of expectations, Asok. People still expect you to add value. Competence is a vicious cycle.

It's better if I don't so you can learn by example.

Tradition requires you to disparage every technology decision made before you got involved. But please be gentle with your criticism of my software. It's like my baby.

I decided to stay, but it was hard to feel good about it.

2014-08-01 *

We need to act more like a start-up.

You mean we can ask for funding for one thing and then pivot six times and build something entirely different?

Is there a version where we don't do any of that and I can still call myself a hacker?

I think so, too.

Spare me the tedious technical details. I make my decisions based on the people involved.

So you replaced your unsupported belief that you could spot winning projects with an unsupported belief that you can identify winning people?

I did a study of our core competencies. It seems we're very good at automating things that we shouldn't be doing in the first place. But that's not all we're good at. We're also good at worshipping the status quo as if it were Steve Jobs' reanimated body. And no one is as good at masking lapses in fiduciary responsibility. Lastly, we're good at hearing what we want to hear.

Carol: <<<
I brought my son to work. Do you have any career advice for him?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
All boys your age are idiots. If you make any career decisions today, your life will forever be determined by an idiot.
>>> Boss: <<<
Are we expecting any unforeseen problems today?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
But you get used to it.
>>>
2014-07-01 * 
Boss: <<<
On the advice of our consultant, we're going to rewrite the CMS from scratch.
>>> Alice: <<<
How much did you pay the consultant for the same advice your employees gave you for free?
>>> Boss: <<<
I don't pay consultants for advice. I pay them to leave.
>>>
2014-06-30 * 
Boss: <<<
You didn't accomplish anything this month.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Sure I did. I did the mandatory training that has no use, attended your mandatory meetings that don't help, and filled out regulatory paperwork for things we don't do.
>>> Boss: <<<
Are you trying to make a point?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Nope. Just being productive.
>>>
2014-06-29 * 
Dogbert: <<<
This is tech support. How may I help you?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Before we start, I need to tell you that I'm a highly trained electrical engineer. I have already eliminated all of the most probable causes of my issue. I have reinstalled the software and I have rebooted several times. So please, if you have any respect for humanity, do not start this call by insisting that I reboot again. Can you do that? Can you not ask me to reboot as your first suggestion?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Try rebooting.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Gaaa!!!
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I kinds love my job.

2014-06-28 * 
Wally: <<<
I have a work-related injury, so I need a year off with pay.
>>> Catbert: <<<
What happened?
>>> Wally: <<<
I was drinking coffee and listening to a podcast while surfing the Internet for personal reasons. Now my buttocks hurt.
>>> Catbert: <<<
I think I'm within my rights to kill you.
>>>
2014-06-27 * 
Wally: <<<
I've been a slacker my entire career, but now I want more out of life. My plan is to listen to podcasts while I drink coffee and search the Internet for fun.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Multi-slacking?
>>> Wally: <<<
Wish me luck.

2014-06-26 * 
Boss: <<<
Our officers came up with a new company slogan after two weeks at a retreat. The new slogan is <<<
Shtop spitting ahn me when you talk!
>>> We believe alcohol was involved.
>>>
2014-06-25 * 
Catbert: <<<
Your management style has caused a black hole to form.
>>> Boss: <<<
Is it dangerous?
>>> Catbert: <<<
No to us. It only absorbs important emails from employees. And en employee named Ted, apparently.
>>>
2014-06-24 * 
Boss: <<<
So... what do you like to do in your spare time?
>>> Interviewee: <<<
Um... I visit orphanages and give back rubs to babies.
>>> Boss: <<<
Maybe you should have practiced for that question.
>>> Interviewee: <<<
And I bike there because I'm so green. Job Interview
2014-06-23 * 
Wally: <<<
Success depends on who you know. I only know losers such as you, so thanks for nothing. Dilbert; I'm sorry I ruined your promising career.
>>> Wally: <<<
You're holding me back.
>>>
2014-06-22 * 
Boss: <<<
Change your recommendation to the opposite of what you wrote and send it to me for approval.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Why do I need approval for the thing you just approved?
>>> Boss: <<<
I want you to feel some ownership.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I already feel that you own me.
>>> Boss: <<<
I mean that I want you to feel ownership of the recommendation.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How can I feel ownership of your ignorant decisions?
>>> Boss: <<<
By getting my approval for them. I can't be more clear.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
At least we agree on that.
>>>

Man 1: Hey, geek! We're going to beat you p for wearing glasses with a camera.
>>> Man 2: <<<
If I'm being honest, this didn't go the way I expected.
>>>
2014-06-20 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Strangers keep beating me up for wearing our new glasses product with a camera.
>>> Boss: <<<
Have you tried acting less creepy and defenseless?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No. Boss; Sounds like user error.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I just Photoshopped your head on a donkey.
>>>
2014-06-19 * 
Man: <<<
I need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement before we start.
>>> Wally: <<<
We don't need that because no one believes a word I say anyway.
>>> Man: <<<
Maybe I'm meeting with the wrong person.
>>> Wally: <<<
You're mighty judgy for a guy with so many secrets.

Jeff: <<<
That will never work. That's the worst idea I have ever heard. Alice; You can't jump off the roof right now.
>>> Jeff: <<<
Uh-oh. Jeff had to prove everyone wrong. It was like a reflex. He couldn't stop it. This was his last day of life.
>>>
2014-06-17 * 
Boss: <<<
I'm getting reports again that you're resistant to change.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I only resist terrible ideas but I can see how that would confuse you.
>>> Boss: <<<
Whatever you're doing, cut it out.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Should I stop being rational in general or only i this one way?
>>>
2014-06-16 * 
Boss: <<<
Our consultant has recommended a company-wide transformation to make us more competitive.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is it a coincidence that consultants always recommend solutions that pay their firms the most?
>>> Boss: <<<
How would I know?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I'll look into that for you.
>>>
2014-06-15 * 
Dilbert: <<<
What a great day!
>>> Alice: <<<
What's all this nonsense?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm trying to be an optimist.
>>> Alice: <<<
Studies show that optimists die younger. So this optimism thing just makes you look ignorant. And because my happiness is based on a comparison to my peers, I don't want your future to be too bright. Stop thinking you're better than me in the future!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
This is exactly why I want to die younger.
>>> Alice: <<<
You already knew that optimists die young?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Yup! How's your plan working?
>>>
2014-06-14 * 
Boss: <<<
I ate three pounds of dark chocolate and it made my brain work better. Now I realize that everything I've done in my career up to this point has been magical thinking and fad-chasing. What should I do?
>>> Catbert: <<<
Stop eating chocolate.
>>>
2014-06-13 * 
Boss: <<<
Here's some dark chocolate. Studies show it makes you think better.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Why are you suddenly doing things that make scientific sense, instead of your usual magical thinking?
>>> Boss: <<<
I just ate three pounds of dark chocolate.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Wow. It works fast.

2014-06-12 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Abusive management has reduced my testosterone levels and left me feeling...
>>> Alice: <<<
Die, you dishrag! Die! Ha ha ha ha ha!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No worries.
>>> Alice: <<<
I sensed weakness.
>>>
2014-06-11 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I read that winning at anything boosts your testosterone.
>>> Boss: <<<
I need one of you underlings to clean the mold out of the office fridge. That's your top priority today.
>>> Wally: <<<
What's this "winning" I keep hearing about?
>>>
2014-06-10 * 
Dilbert: <<<
The problem is that we don't know what we don't know.
>>> Coworker: <<<
You stole that saying from me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It's a common saying. I've been using it for years.
>>> Coworker: <<<
No, you stole it from me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
This is officially the dumbest conversation I've ever had.
>>> Coworker: <<<
That's my other saying!
>>>
2014-06-09 * 
Wally: <<<
We announced huge losses, but analysts thought it would be even worse, so our stock went up. I'm using a similar system to get a big raise. For years I've been lowering everyone's expectations of my performance. Next I'll... I made a phone call today.
>>> Boss: <<<
Employee of the year!
>>>
2014-06-08 * 
Dilbert: <<<
What's your son doing here?
>>> Coworker: <<<
Today is 'Bring Your Kid To The Cesspool Day.
>>> The idea is to show kids how horrible it is to work in an office. That way, they can make better choices and avoid a life like ours.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Just out of curiosity, who told you this is <<<
Bring Your Kid To The Cesspool Day?
>>> Coworker: Wally. Oh.
>>> Child: <<<
I've decided to become a career criminal.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Good luck with all of that.

2014-06-07 * 
Coworker: <<<
My name is Alan, and my job in Marketing is to spray perfume on skunks.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm Dilbert. My job as an engineer is to resist killing Alan.
>>> Coworker: <<<
You're doing a terrific job.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Stop spraying me with perfume! Introductions
2014-06-06 * 
Boss: <<<
So... how's your job going?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It's like being buried alive in a burlap bag full of starving rats.
>>> Boss: <<<
And I'm back to not caring.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How long will it take you to fix everything?
>>>
2014-06-05 * 
Robot: <<<
I'm rapidly evolving into a super-intelligent being with godlike powers.
>>> Topper: <<<
That's nothing!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
My allergies are bad today.
>>> Topper: <<<
That's nothing!
>>>
2014-06-04 * 
Robot: <<<
Someday robots will do all of the technology work and humans will only do creative jobs. If you engineers work hard, someday the spoils will go to the liberal arts majors who partied while you studied. I hear good things about origami. It's not too late to get into that game.

Dilbert: <<<
Our boss injected me with job performance enhancing drugs.
>>> Wally: <<<
Job performance be gone! Apparently, I can do that now.
>>> Asok: <<<
I must find more disciples.
>>>
2014-06-02 * 
Boss: <<<
You've set several world records for best employee job performance. But I can't give you a raise because you used job performance enhancing drugs.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You injected me against my will.
>>> Boss: <<<
It would be leadership if you wanted to do it.
>>>
2014-06-01 * 
Boss: <<<
Did you see my email about the eight things that successful people do?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Yes. I did all eight things and now I'm a huge success.
>>> Boss: <<<
No you're not.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm not? How's that possible? I did all of the things that successful people do. This only makes sense if the inspirational links you send me every day are a complete waste of time! So which one is it? Am I a huge success or do you email me worthless things?
>>> Boss: <<<
Maybe we should just change the subject.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is that what successful people do?
>>>
2014-05-31 * 
Dilbert: <<<
our boss injected me with job performance enhancing drugs.
>>> Alice: <<<
Gaaa!!! Evolution has made me attracted to your physical attributes!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm sort of a jerk now.
>>> Alice: <<<
Noooo! That's my kryptonite!
>>>
2014-05-30 * 
Boss: <<<
I found a quick way to make you more motivated and competitive. I know it's safe because it's all natural. The only known side effects are psychopathy and an improved dating life.
>>>
2014-05-29 * 
Boss: <<<
You missed all of your goals.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Because of poor management. I'll go into more detail when I do my 360-degree review of you.
>>> Boss: <<<
I meant to say you're doing great.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's what I meant to say too.
>>>
2014-05-28 * 
Boss: <<<
Alice, you've been nominated by your peers for the "good attitude award."
>>> Alice: <<<
Get out of here with your stupid, useless award!!!
>>> Boss: <<<
Maybe I shouldn't let peers do the voting.
>>> Wally: <<<
I like her odds to win again next month.

Boss: <<<
For environmental reasons, all used batteries must be discarded in the special receptacle in the break room. When it's full, the janitor will dump it into the regular trash and take it to the landfill.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Maybe we could ask him not to.
>>> Boss: <<<
No one know what language he speaks.
>>>
2014-05-26 * 
Boss: <<<
You have a large-screen smartphone, and yet you don't work while walking from one place to another. That's like stealing from the company.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I didn't realize I had chose a life of crime.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
And you're not even doing it right.
>>>
2014-05-25 * 
Boss: <<<
Experts say I need employees who can say no to me. I'd like you to be my trusted adviser, Wally, because you can criticize every idea I have.
>>> Wally: <<<
No. That's the dumbest plan I've ever heard.
>>> Boss: <<<
What?
>>> Wally: <<<
You heard me.
>>> Boss: <<<
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do now.
>>> Wally: <<<
You could thank me for saying no.
>>> Boss: <<<
Why does that sound right?!!!!
>>> Wally: <<<
You're welcome.

We're having an early adopter problem with our wearable tech products.
>>> CEO: <<<
No one wants to go first?

I wish we had that problem.

I wonder if we look as cool as we feel.

Let's hit the clubs and find out.

2014-05-22 * 
Boss: <<<
None of my subordinates are supportive. I don't know why.

Perhaps they're sensing that you have troll DNA.

Um... what?
>>> Therapist: <<<
Did your mom ever live under a bridge?

2014-05-21 * 
Alice: <<<
Did you read the article I forwarded about the ten things every leader should be doing? I defended your honor by writing a blog post saying you don't do any of those things and you still get paid.
>>> Boss: <<<
Why doesn't this feel supportive?
>>> Alice: <<<
That's one of life's little mysteries.
>>>
2014-05-20 * 
Boss; I lost all of my money to a phishing scam.

Must... stifle... laugh. Mmmph! Pressure is building. Must contain...
>>> Boss: <<<
Are you being supportive? I can't tell.
>>> Catbert: <<<
Mmmph!
>>>
2014-05-19 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Scam.

Scam.

Okey-dokey. Why Phishing Scams Keep Working. Wait for it. There it is.

2014-05-18 * 
Dilbert: <<<
You never answered my IM.
>>> Alice: <<<
You should have emailed me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I did. You didn't answer my email.
>>> Alice: <<<
If it was so important, you should have texted me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You didn't answer my texts. Alice; You have to text my personal phone.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You didn't answer those texts either.
>>> Alice: <<<
Had it been important, you would have called me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I did. You didn't answer your phone and you don't return calls. So here I am.
>>> Alice: <<<
It's premature to get your hopes up.
>>>
2014-05-17 * 
Boss: <<<
Experts say you'll be more engaged if you have a friend at work. And when you're engaged, I can pay you less and you won't quit.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So this guy is costing me money?
>>> Wally: <<<
Don't flatter yourself. I barely know your name.
>>>
2014-05-16 * 
Dilbert: <<<
How much wearable tech can I use before I'm technically a cyborg?
>>> Garbage Man: <<<
It doesn't matter because you're a software simulation created by humans who perished after the technological singularity. And you're programmed to scoff at what I just said.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Crazy old coot.
>>>
2014-05-15 * 
Woman: <<<
I don't date cyborgs.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm not a cyborg. Yet.
>>> Woman: <<<
I don't date time travelers from the future. Dilbert; I'm not a time traveler.
>>> Woman: <<<
My third guess is less flattering.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm a time traveler.

Wally: <<<
The distractions of the digital age have rewired my brain and ruined my ability to focus. Now I find it painful to dwell on any topic for longer than five seconds.
>>> Boss: <<<
Let's talk about this.
>>> Wally: <<<
No-o-o! Change the topic!
>>>
2014-05-13 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Studies say people are losing their ability to focus because of all the digital distractions.
>>> Wally: <<<
Sorry, what?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Hold on...
>>> Wally: <<<
What were you saying?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I dunno. Probably wasn't important.
>>>
2014-05-12 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Can I take my vacation next week?
>>> Boss: <<<
Fine. Just work twice as hard this week to get everything done before you leave.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
In that case, I prefer not taking a vacation at all.
>>> Boss: <<<
It's starting to look as if nothing can make you happy.
>>>
2014-05-11 * 
Boss: <<<
Okay, let's see how employee 3452378 is doing. According to our employee tracking system, you have wandered around the office 17% more than the average employee.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Maybe I have more meetings than most people.
>>> Boss: <<<
No, most of the difference is in restroom trips and detours past an attractive woman's desk. Your wrist monitor shows unacceptably low levels of caffeine for your workload. That's probably why your typos are up 9% and you have looked away from your workstation nine more times than last month. Now your wrist monitor indicated a desire to bean an authority figure to death with his own tablet computer. Phew! Your brain's wuss subroutine just kicked in. The danger has passed.
>>>
2014-05-10 * 
Boss: <<<
Did you see my email about your business plan?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Was it a rambling and disjointed email that showed no understanding of the problem or the proposed solution?
>>> Boss: <<<
No.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Oh. Then apparently I haven't seen it.
>>>
2014-05-09 * 
CEO: <<<
Studies show that people who exercise are healthier.
>>> Wally: <<<
That's because people who are in poor health don't exercise.
>>> CEO: <<<
Why does it seem as if you ruin every meeting?
>>> Wally: <<<
Is it because I only attend the ones that are stupid?
>>>
2014-05-08 * 
Boss; Interviews are getting awkward because of the new rule that human resources has to approve all questions. And you haven't approved any yet.
>>> Catbert: <<<
Heh heh heh heh heh heh!
>>> Boss: <<<
Stop enjoying my pain!
>>> Catbert: <<<
Stop making it so enjoyable!
>>>
2014-05-07 * 
Boss: <<<
Are you sure the data you gave me is correct?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I've been giving you incorrect data for years. This is the first time you've asked.
>>> Boss: <<<
What?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I said the data is totally accurate.
>>>
2014-05-06 * 
Wally: <<<
Last week, I did my corporate charity work by teaching unemployed people how to interview for jobs.
>>> Boss: <<<
Don't they also need job skills?
>>> Wally: <<<
Nah. I taught them how to look busy.
>>> Boss: <<<
No boss will be fooled by that.
>>> Wally: <<<
Do you believe I trained unemployed people last week?
>>>
2014-05-05 * 
Boss: <<<
Our CEO has asked each of us to donate 1% of our work time to a charitable cause.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Last week you told us to give 110% to our work. Does this mean we can back off to 109%?
>>> Boss: <<<
No, you should give 110% to everything you do.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Maybe my charitable cause could be helping you learn math.
>>>
2014-05-04 * 
Boss: <<<
Does anyone have any billion-dollar product ideas?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
There's a logical problem with that question. If I had a billion-dollar idea, I would quit this job and start my own company. Only a dumb person would give you his best idea for free. And the best idea from a dumb person is still dumb. But I am willing to give you some ideas that are too lame for my own use.
>>> Boss: <<<
Can you at least pretend to suggest good ideas?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Sure. How about a phone with a wooden screen?
>>> Wally: <<<
How about a drone that attacks anyone who looks at it?
>>>
2014-05-03 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Your last job was doing publicity for a famous magician. Why did you leave.
>>> Interviewee: <<<
My boss fired me after the trick where he stayed in a sewer full of rats for a month.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I didn't hear about that.
>>> Interviewee: <<<
I forgot to tell anyone it was happening.
>>>
2014-05-02 * 
Wally: <<<
My project is coming along great. Everything is on time and under budget.
>>> Boss: <<<
Do you really expect me to believe that everything you're working on is going smoothly?
>>> Wally: <<<
No, but apparently you believe I work, and I didn't see that coming either.
>>>
2014-05-01 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I emailed you the PowerPoint slide for your investor meeting. I dumbed down the technical stuff for you non-engineers.
>>> Boss: <<<
"Technology: It Be Good."
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I wouldn't take questions.
>>>
2014-04-30 * 
Boss: <<<
I need you to make a PowerPoint deck for my meeting with investors. I'll be telling them everything I know about technology, competition, and the industry.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So... just the one slide?
>>> Boss: <<<
Huh?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How big do these fonts go?
>>>
2014-04-29 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I had a question about your feedback on my business plan. You called it a "lumbering monument to incompetence, dishonesty and corporate dysfunction."
>>> Alice: <<<
What's your question?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Do you think it should be longer?
>>>
2014-04-28 * 
Boss: <<<
I need you to write a business plan for our new line of products.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is that because business plans have a good track record of being useful and accurate?  Boss: No, it's nothing like that.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Good, because I plan to make up all of the numbers.
>>>
2014-04-27 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Wally, I want you to create a new business strategy for the company. Then use your laptop in a coffee shop that has public access to wi-fi. Hackers will get into your computer in minutes and steal your strategy document. With any luck, the hackers will sell those secrets to our competitors. Obviously, we would never use any strategy you created, so our competitors will be misled.
>>> Wally: <<<
So... you want me to do a bad job on an assignment and then go drink coffee?
>>> Boss: <<<
Can you handle that?
>>> Wally: <<<
I like my odds.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Why do you want a copy of our business strategy?
>>> Wally: <<<
It'll save a step.
>>>
2014-04-26 * 
Randy: <<<
Hey, Dilbert. We met last week.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
We did? I only try to remember things that might be important. Everything else I flush.
>>> Randy: <<<
My name is Randy.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
*flush* 
2014-04-25 * 
Randy: <<<
Hi. I'm Randy.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I can't memorize names and shake hands at the same time.
>>> Randy: <<<
It's Randy. Dilbert; Don't even bother. Seriously.
>>>
2014-04-24 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Experts say I can improve my likeability by showing that I remember things that people have told me. For example, there was the time you said you always go to funerals dressed as a clown to keep things light.
>>> Ted: <<<
I never said that!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Are you sure? I told everyone you did.
>>>
2014-04-23 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I read that using people's names and giving insincere compliments will make me likeable. Good job pouring that coffee, Wally. You didn't spill a drop.
>>> Wally: <<<
I don't feel any different.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Maybe the problem is on your end.
>>>
2014-04-22 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I need an exception to the travel budget freeze so I can fix an important customer's technical problem.
>>> Boss: <<<
No, because arbitrary financial targets are more important than satisfying customers. Wait... why does that sound bad when I say it out lout?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
If it makes you feel better, I wasn't listening.
>>>
2014-04-21 * 
Boss: <<<
The travel budget is frozen so we can meet our income estimates for this quarter.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is that because all business travel is a waste of time or because we no longer care about long-term profitability? Take as long as you need.
>>> Boss: <<<
Um...
>>>
2014-04-20 * 
Tina: <<<
You need to clean the break room refrigerator more often.
>>> Wally: <<<
We're engineers. We only do the highest priority tasks.
>>> Tina: <<<
Mold started to grow in there.
>>> Wally: <<<
That's no big deal.
>>> Tina: <<<
Bacteria caused the mold to mutate.
>>> Wally: <<<
So what?
>>> Tina: <<<
It rapidly evolved into a sentient being fueled by forgotten lunches. Then it learned language skills and got a job in Human Resources. It plans to frame you for viewing inappropriate websites at work and then fire you.
>>> Wally: <<<
This sort of thing usually works itself out.
>>>
2014-04-19 * 
Boss: <<<
The best advice anyone ever gave me was "be true to yourself."
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That literally doesn't mean anything.
>>> Wally: <<<
I usually don't like to get involved, but you make me curious what the worst advice was.
>>>
2014-04-18 * 
Boss; Tina, I need you to write a company <<<
Origin Story.
>>> All the cool companies have them.
>>> Tina: <<<
Why?
>>> Boss: <<<
Why? Well, for starters, we need it for various things and so on. I don't think I can be any clearer.
>>> Tina: <<<
I don't think you can, either.
>>>
2014-04-17 * 
Boss: <<<
I'm only allowed to ask interview questions that have been approved by Human Resources. And they haven't approved any yet. So all I can do is make random statements. An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain.
>>> Interviewee: <<<
So is mine!

Email is down again.

The only guy who can fix it is in the hospital.

So... if he dies, we can never again have email?
>>> Mordac: <<<
Maybe.

Is there any way I can reach him?

Wait a week and try a Oiji board.

Dilbert: <<<
I have a great idea?

What kind? Is it the kind I scoff at, the kind I steal, or the kind that makes me double your workload?

It might be all of those.

Sounds good so far.

close?

Why would I do that?

I can't fix your problem, so instead, I'll plant some false memories and try to fix those later. Do you remember being a robot that was designed by aliens?

No.

I was.

Our product name reminds people of bodily fluids and death. People hate us because our CEO has an endangered owl shooting range on his super yacht.

Plantkiller? Who calls me that?

You can't compare apples and oranges.

That's clearly wrong because you just compared them and declared them different.
>>> Wally: <<<
Apples and oranges are both foods that grow on trees. It would be totally valid to compare them nutritionally.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I've noticed that a lot of what comes out of your mouth makes no sense.

You sound like my wife.

You can't compare your wife to your subordinate. That's apples and oranges.

I don't know, but I wouldn't compare it to work.

Before we start my performance review, I should remind you that it would take three people to replace me. And I will resign at the slightest criticism, leaving you with a huge hiring and budget problem.

You should let me work at home a few days per week because studies show that telecommuters put in more hours.

I want you to create a clever video about our product for the Internet. But make sure it goes viral or you're a total failure.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No one can predict what goes viral. Marketing experts fail at this sort of thing 99% of the time. I'm an engineer with no relevant skills for this assignment.
>>> Boss: <<<
Maybe you could succeed if you had more passion.

Gaaa!!! I need a rational boss, not passion!

Great leaders set high standards and stay out of the way. So... I want you to build a fusion-powered robot that can run faster than the speed of light! While you're doing that, I'll be staying out of your way. You won't see or hear from me. I won't even respond to email.

Is there a budget for this impossible project?

Now that we're organized as a holacracy, I need to learn how to look busy like the rest of you.

Try walking into people's cubicles without an invitation and babbling about things they don't care about.

I should write this down.
>>>
2014-03-04 * 
Boss: <<<
Now that we're organized as a holacracy, I have no idea what I should be doing.

Holacracy involves dynamic governance, transparent operations, and harnessing your conscious capacity.
>>> Boss: <<<
That sounds like "wander around."
>>> Catbert: <<<
Try to do it dynamically.

2014-03-03 * 
CEO: <<<
I'm eliminating all management levels and making us a holacracy.

2014-03-02 * 
Boss: <<<
Do you have any great ideas?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How would I know?

You could tell me your ideas and I'll judge them Dilbert: That's like asking a chipmunk to judge algebra.
>>> Boss: <<<
Are you comparing me to algebra?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Sure, let's go with that.
>>> Boss: <<<
That makes sense because algebra is complex and useful... just like me.

I don't know what to do now.

Maybe that's the problem.
>>>
2014-02-28 * 
Boss: <<<
For some reason, your written goals for last year were "Drink lots of coffee" and "Disrespect authority."

Maybe next year your goal should be something about reading my goals before you sign them. Accomplishing stuff feels good. You should try it.

2014-02-27 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I'm happy to report that I achieved every goal you set for me last year.

For this exact situation.

I learned that knowledge is overrated.

Dilbert: <<<
Does anyone have an objection to this plan?
>>> Coworker: <<<
In my opinion, there are too many potential problems.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
This system has been used for years in other places and works fine.
>>> Coworker: <<<
There is still a non-zero chance of problems.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
By that logic, we should get rid of hospitals because sometimes they make mistakes.

You can still lead a normal life.

It only stings for a minute.

Hello, ordinary workers. I am a new employee just like you.

Sure. Can I make it painful?

Why would you even ask that?

Cryonics will allow me to preserve my brain until the age of transhumanism so I can live forever in a robot body.

Please kill me now.

I don't do favors that can't be repaid.

How about this image of a clown with a broken watch?
>>> Boss: <<<
I was thinking eagle.

Fine. Eagle.

Now find an image that shows our technology strategy.

How about this image of an old show in a storm drain?

How about this image of a dictionary?

Can I sign up for a workshop on how to deal with difficult co-workers? People will be using those methods against me, and I need to know how to thwart their countermeasures.
>>> Boss: <<<
Will you leave my office if I say yes?
>>> Alice: <<<
Where did you learn that trick?!!

2014-02-13 * 
Boss: <<<
The key to leadership is setting vague goals that are a combination of jargon and wishful thinking. That way, I can keep dumping work on you without hearing you whine that it doesn't fit with your goals. You have to admit, my system is better than whatever you're doing over there.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Yup.

2014-02-12 * 
CEO: <<<
Who's up for some leadership? Watch me define acceptable behavior, align your goals with company objectives, prioritize respect, deal directly with conflict, maintain a positive attitude, and pretend to care!

If a shadowy figure offers to buy company secrets, what should you do?

Only if you are prepared for your ritual shaming.

Yes, always.

Okay, here it goes. What kind of engineer doesn't know how to set up temporary credentials? Ha ha ha ha! I will tell this story for years! Hey, everyone! Guess what Dilbert doesn't know! That should be enough to poison your well of credibility.

Then why do I feel so alive?

I can never return to India because the Supreme Court made it illegal to be gay there. Does it worry you that they have a nuclear arsenal and the scientific knowledge of inebriated astrologists?

They might nuke the Taj Mahal.

I know! That place is so gay, right?
>>>
2014-02-07 *

The Supreme Court of India recently voted to uphold a law making it a crime to be born gay.* To commemorate that hopelessly ignorant decision, Asok the intern is now officially gay. Okay, we're done here.

Good, because I have a lot of gay stuff to do. *essentially

Weren't you obese yesterday?

I got the "Insanity" workout video.

And that was the easy part...

Dilbert: <<<
I took your advice to start overeating so I could save all of my willpower for work. The only downside is a twenty-year reduction in my life expectancy.
>>> Boss: <<<
Are you okay with that?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Who would want twenty extra years of my life?

2014-02-03 * 
Boss: <<<
Studies say willpower is finite. If you use it for one thing, you have less for another. So if it feels hard to work long hours, without any reward, try eating cake for lunch.

For once, it wasn't all bad.

I can eat two pizzas by myself.

How do you count the people who have gluten sensitivity and don't eat pizza?

If I apply Zeno's Paradox to the slice size, can I have infinite attendees?

How does cheese bread fit into this?

I discovered that the customer for our fleet sale of commercial drones is an international terrorist. Now we have to cancel the order, take a big hit to earnings, and decimate the value of your stock options in the company.

Or... I could transfer you to a department that has a poor safety record and hope for the best.

2014-01-28 * 
Boss: <<<
We won the bid to build a fleet of small drones for retail package delivery. I'm not sure why they call their customers infidels, but I doubt that's important. You'll be working with their design guy, who's name is Mullah John Smith.

Our big data analysis tells us that only the top performers leave for higher pay. Since you're still here, it means your performance is average at best.

What's the newest management jargon I need to pretend you understand?
>>> Catbert: <<<
Experts say you should engage employees and follow from the front.
>>> Boss: <<<
Does that mean anything?
>>> Catbert: <<<
No one know. Just to be safe, you should tell people you're doing it.
>>> Boss: <<<
Should I act as if I'm passionate, or is this more of a fake caring situation?
>>> Catbert: <<<
Beats me. Try combining the two.
>>> Boss: <<<
Fake passion plus fake caring.

Okay, your job is to keep Jeff from doing anything.

This report says you slapped our CEO senseless after he said they key to success is following your instinct.

I was following my instinct. I was also being passionate, engaged, and creative.
>>> Catbert: <<<
Apparently the things you say actually mean stuff.
>>> CEO: <<<
How was I to know!

2014-01-23 * 
CEO: <<<
The key to success is to follow your instinct.

My instinct tells me to slap you until you stop babbling nonsense.

Please don't do that.

Relax. I have a good feeling about it.

I don't have the data you requested last week because I didn't know how you wanted it formatted.

We discovered that our product name is an insult in the Elbonian language. So I hired an Elbonian to review our new choices.

Gaaa!!! You have offended Bixtappa, the deity of unseasonably warm weather and twice-baked potatoes. Our tradition says I must now strangle you with a mud adder. Luckily, I brought one.

We need employees that are motivated by our vision, not by money.

You had a great idea bout upgrading our customer support software.
>>> Boss: <<<
I don't remember having that idea.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It was genius.
>>> Boss: <<<
Well, that does sound like something I would suggest.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
We'll need budget approval, but that should be no problem for you.
>>> Boss: <<<
Duh. Obviously I'll fund my idea. It's genius.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'll need to delay my other project, but, as you said, those are lower priorities.

I said that?

It was very wise of you.

How did you get funding for your idea?

I had to bossify it.

That's your oxytocin talking.

Experts say I can increase your engagement by caring for your emotional well-being. I would give you a hug, but I'm afraid of getting whatever made you this way. But I am willing to touch a rat that touches you, and that's not nothing.

If you live for today, how will you avoid starving tomorrow? If you do one little thing wrong today, it could ruin every minute of the rest of your life.

So... I should live for the future.
>>> Wally: <<<
No, that would ruin today. I recommend living for the past.
>>> Asok: <<<
My past was no fun.

In phase two, I'll also make you angrier than me.

My new fragrance. It's half pepper spray and half gym sock. It has a dual purpose. The pepper spray is so I can build up an immunity to it.

That'll probably come in handy someday.

Dilbert: <<<
I like my job. But I don't like any of the tasks... or any of the people... I don't like the commute... and I'm paid less than I'm worth... and I'm not making the world a better place.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Are you sure you like your job?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Why do you ask?
>>>
2013-11-08 * 
Boss: <<<
I'd like to thank myself for my great leadership on the project. Some of you did useful things, too, but only because I threatened to fire you if you didn't. So don't let it go to your heads.
>>> Catbert: <<<
I hope you didn't tell them they did good work.
>>> Boss: <<<
No, that makes them greedy.
>>>
2013-11-07 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Do you know why I need to carry a company-issued phone plus my own phone?
>>> Boss: <<<
No.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I think it's because our company policy was written by chimps who time-traveled from the fifties. Or do you have a better explanation.
>>> Boss: <<<
I really don't.
>>>
2013-11-06 * 
Alice: <<<
Okay, Skype. Let's see if I can figure out how to shut you down. Close! Quit! Sign out! Minimize! Quit! Yes! Close! Quit! Die! Die! Die!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Did you close Skype.
>>> Alice: <<<
Almost. I'm heading to the ocean to drown it.
>>>
2013-11-05 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Do you know who keeps raking my good cables and replacing them with defective ones?
>>> Alice: <<<
Certainly not me. But I did see an Elbonian wearing a hoodie near your bench.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm not good at reading people.
>>> Alice: <<<
I'm counting on that.
>>>
2013-11-04 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Every time I leave the lab, some jerk steals my cables and replaces them with their bad ones. Then I have to spend hours stealing back one cable at a time and testing each one.
>>> Boss: <<<
Doesn't that make you one of the cable-stealing jerks?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You've never met a problem you couldn't worsen.
>>>
2013-11-03 * 
CEO: <<<
We only succeed when we treat each other with respect. Are you video-recording me with those Google glasses?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Huh?
>>> CEO: <<<
You're fired for recording a confidential meeting! Pack your bags, you worthless piece of garbage! I got your final check right here!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
These are my regular glasses. Having cleared that up, you were saying something about respect?
>>> CEO: <<<
Settle down, four-eyes. This isn't over.

2013-11-02 * 
Boss: <<<
Tina, I asked you to write up the best ideas from our brainstorming session. The top one on your list is <<<
A Robot Made of Lunch Meat.
>>> That's basically just a human.
>>> Tina: <<<
What part of <<<
Best Ideas" is confusing you?
>>>
2013-11-01 * 
Boss: <<<
Who wants to go first with the brainstorming?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I suggest we ignore all of the studies that say brainstorming doesn't work.

Now I hate you a little extra.

Because I agreed with your plan?

I hired a desiccated crone to teach an etiquette class to you engineering heathens. She'll help you stop eating your business lunches like kidnap victims.

Boss: <<<
The key to great leadership is setting clear expectations and periodically revising them as conditions change.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
If you plan to revise expectations, that tells me you know them to be faulty now.
>>> Boss: <<<
Maybe.
>>> Wally: <<<
Stop inspiring me so much.
>>>
2013-10-28 * 
Boss: <<<
According to studies, employees will work harder if they think their managers care about them. But that's hard for me because you're basically a sausage casing full of coffee and rotting organs.

That must have stung.

Less than you'd think.

2013-10-27 * 
Boss: <<<
I'd like to recognize Ted for writing his part of the code in just two days.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How many days was it supposed to take?
>>> Boss: <<<
At least a week, I would think.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Why would you think that?
>>> Boss: <<<
Because it was so hard to do.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Who told you it was hard?
>>> Boss: <<<
Ted did.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
All he did was delete some lines from existing code and recompile it.
>>> Ted: <<<
It was hard.
>>> Boss: <<<
See!
>>> Wally: <<<
Do you have any more crazy conspiracy theories?
>>>
2013-10-26 * 
Alice: <<<
Futurists say that someday humans will have the know-how to create an entire universe.

I'm planning to take advantage of our new unlimited vacation policy. I'll be gone for two hundred days in the coming year. And I guarantee I will still double my productivity compared to the prior year.
>>> Boss: <<<
There's no way to measure productivity for engineers.
>>> Wally: <<<
Good to know.
>>>
2013-10-22 * 
Catbert: <<<
We're jumping on the fad of giving employees unlimited vacation days. The only gating factor will be the knowledge that taking any time off whatsoever will torpedo your career.
>>> Alice: <<<
So... now our vacations will be a source of stress?

Only as much as you want. It's totally up to you.

2013-10-21 * 
Boss: <<<
I'd like you to meet the two trolls who create our annual budget.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Why do we need two of them?
>>> Troll: <<<
Because it's hard to reach into your own...
>>> Boss: <<<
Whoa! It's better to keep some mystery.
>>>
2013-10-20 * 
Dilbert: <<<
What do you do for a living?
>>> Woman: <<<
I'm a social media consultant.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I like you.
>>> Woman: <<<
Phhht. You're giving me one like? Anything less than ten thousand likes is an insult.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'll be right back. I hired an Elbonian to artificially inflate your like count.
>>> Elbonian: <<<
Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I am not paying that guy.
>>>
2013-10-19 * 
Boss: <<<
Why is your project taking longer than expected?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It's only taking longer than dumb people expected.
>>> Boss: <<<
Still, that's a lot of people.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What can I say to make this conversation end?
>>>
2013-10-18 * 
Alice: <<<
I'm working on a new facial expression to scare away the weak. Want to see it?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No. Gaaa!!!
>>> Alice: <<<
That one means I'm too busy to talk.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I said no! I said no! I said no!
>>>
2013-10-17 * 
Boss: <<<
You didn't handle this the way I told you.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
In my defense, you're under-informed and less clever than me. I was hoping he'd say, <<<
Good point,

2013-10-16 * 
Dogbert: <<<
You need to focus on your career or your family. You can't do both.

I don't have a family.

Actually, you're married and you have four kids.

That sounds like a huge hassle.

Perhaps you've already chosen.

Executive Coach
2013-10-15 * 
Alice: <<<
People used to think it took 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. But now people think the amount of practice you need depends on your genetic makeup. So you'd be good to go after a million or so hours.
>>> Wally: <<<
See why I don't bother?
>>>
2013-10-14 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Every time I think I've invented something, I find out it already exists.
>>> Mombert: <<<
Maybe that's because all minds are connected by the morphic field.

Morphic fields are pseudoscience, mom.
>>> Mombert: <<<
I also blame your dad's crappy genes.

2013-10-13 * 
CEO: <<<
I read an article that says leaders should acknowledge the achievements of their underlings. Have you done anything lately that warrants some praise?
>>> Boss: <<<
Well... I'm under budget because I forgot to staff one of our projects.
>>> CEO: <<<
Okay, I can work with that. Now I think I'm supposed to pat you on the head or something. Let's try that and see how we feel. Stop leaning in.
>>> Boss: <<<
Feels... so... good.

Behold my new invention, the likes of which the world has never seen.

Google: crushing dreams since 1998.

2013-10-11 * 
Wally: <<<
You claim to be an introvert and yet you never seem to be drained when you talk to me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's because you don't put off a human vibe. I experience you in the same way I experience birds, furniture, and robots.
>>> Wally: <<<
You totally get me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Don't talk.
>>>
2013-10-10 * 
Coworker: <<<
Are you okay? You don't look well.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm an introvert. Being near you is draining the energy from my body.
>>> Coworker: <<<
I'm not sure how to take that.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I can't feel my legs!
>>>
2013-10-09 * 
Boss: <<<
Bring me solutions, not complaints.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Okay. Let's abolish the layer of management that does nothing but demand solutions.
>>> Boss: <<<
Now you're just being a jerk.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is that a complaint?
>>>
2013-10-08 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Can you offer us a discount?
>>> Salesman: <<<
I had something like that in mind, except instead of giving a discount, I would hit you with a chair and run away.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Please don't do that.
>>> Salesman: <<<
Okay, but I'll have to charge you extra. Salesman vs. Engineer
2013-10-07 * 
Wally: <<<
I'm a headhunter and I know someone who wants to offer you a much better job.

Alice: <<<
Who's up for some peer coaching?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What?
>>> Alice: <<<
It's the latest thing.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Then it must be good.
>>> Alice: <<<
I'll complain about all of my work problems while you sit there and listen. Then you'll ask insightful questions that will cause me to come up with my own solutions.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Okay. Have you considered the possibility that you cause all of your own problems by um... being you?
>>> Alice: <<<
You're terrible at this But that's not surprise because you're terrible at most things. I hope you die badly.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Do I ask another insightful question now?
>>>
2013-10-05 * 
Boss: <<<
Our policy is to promote from within.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How will you backfill the jobs of the people you promoted?
>>> Boss: <<<
From within.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's one of your better plans.

2013-10-04 * 
Boss: <<<
Our products are getting worse every day. But our marketing keeps improving. We're very close to the point where our customers will give us money for no reason. Then we can give ourselves huge raises and do no work at all.

I like everything you said, except the "we" part.

Wally: <<<
I'm happy to report that I spent 50% more time in meetings this quarter.

That's not an accomplishment! Meetings are a complete waste of time!

How would I have learned that without a meeting?

Boss: <<<
You're lazy, undependable, and disruptive. That's why I can't give you a raise this year.

How'd it go?
>>> Wally: <<<
He blamed the victim.

2013-09-30 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I heard that marketing's optogenic device tweaked some of your preferences.

Yup. Now I'm a gay anarchist who loves football and string cheese.

Sounds like a big adjustment.

Well, the cheese part came easily.

Dilbert: <<<
Okay, you talked me into buying the deluxe edition.
>>> Salesman: <<<
We don't have that one in stock, but I could call around to our other stores.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Technically, that means this is not actually a store. You're more like online shopping, but with a terrible user interface. Watch me buy that same item with my phone while you stand there being obsolete. And... done.
>>> Salesman: <<<
Did they try to sell you an unnecessary warranty extension?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No.
>>> Salesman: <<<
Yes! I still have a purpose!

Here's my digital receipt.

2013-09-28 *

We replaced our entire marketing department with one evil genius.

Jerk.

In my defense, you send mixed signals.

I got your stupid email with your stupid link to that stupid scientific study. I don't care about your so-called <<<

Dogbert; Research shows that CEOs are more likely to be psychopaths. Obviously, being a psychopath works. Don't let anyone tell you different. How's your grandiose sense of self-worth?

It's the best. I should kill you for asking. Executive Coaching
2013-09-24 * 
Dogbert: <<<
The ROI for executive coaching is 9,000%.

Wow! That's a lot! But I need a coach who won't ask em to do anything differently.

I wasn't planning to show up for our meetings.
>>> CEO: <<<
Perfect. How much do I owe you for today? Dogbert The Executive Coach
2013-09-23 * 
CEO: <<<
Our corporate structure is so complicated that I have no idea where our money even comes from I think it comes from derivatives or offshore accounts or maybe goodwill.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Or maybe customers give us money.

I hope not. I don't like to feel beholden.

2013-09-22 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I'm panicked about my presentation tomorrow.
>>> Wally: <<<
Relax. What's the worst that could happen?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Well, I could embarrass myself in a career-ending way.
>>> Wally: <<<
Oh. I didn't think about that one. It might be so bad that you can't even get a recommendation for a future job. Then you'd have an emotional meltdown followed by substance abuse, untreated health issues, and a lonely death. And it could all happen because of something as trivial as a typo on one of your slides. I guess I can add "comforting" to my list of things I'm no good at.
>>>
2013-09-21 * 
Dilbert: <<<
What's your take on code consistency versus best practices for legacy systems? Boss; I want all of that stuff and I want it now.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
When people ask what you do for a living, what the $%@* do you say?
>>>
2013-09-20 * 
Boss: <<<
What's taking you so long on the project?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
The application is unstable because the data model is driven by an overly complex relational database and there was no integration testing.
>>> Boss: <<<
Does any of that mean the same thing as <<<
lazy?
>>>
2013-09-19 * 
Boss: <<<
How's the innovation going?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Amazing. It couldn't be better. Right now it's all happening in my mind. Bit if any of it gets out, I'll let you know. Boss; I think's it's fair to say I managed the bejeezus out of that situation.
>>>
2013-09-18 * 
Dogbert: <<<
Today I'll teach you how to innovate the way Apple, Google, and 3M do it. Replace all of your dimwitted employees with smart people... then fire yourselves. The rest is just blah, blah, blah.
>>> Boss: <<<
Should we be taking notes?
>>>
2013-09-17 * 
Dogbert: <<<
I'm starting a new business as a professional liar. I'll provide alibis, job references, annual reports, and that sort of thing. Dilbert; Were you born evil?

It feels as if someone else had a hand in it.
>>>
2013-09-16 * 
Wally: <<<
I thought you were on the run for hacking the government's databases.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I was. But they forgot to reset their passwords, so I deleted my case file and gave myself a tax break.
>>> Wally: <<<
Did you get me anything?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You're the new face on pennies.
>>>
2013-09-15 * 
Boss; Don't make any product changes without change orders. When users ask for new features, direct them to the online change order system.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That system only has the old forms.
>>> Boss: <<<
Tell someone to put the new ones on there.
>>> Wally: <<<
That would require a change order.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Maybe we could tell users our sense of hope was killed by something called management. The we could sort of slump over like we're waiting for death's cold embrace.
>>> Boss: <<<
I'll get back to you if I think of a better plan.

We don't have a lot of fancy technology in our embassy. If you want to send a message to the outside world, carve it on a peanut and give it to a squirrel.

The squirrel would eat the peanut.

Wow! You do not trust squirrels. Dilbert seeks asylum at Elbonia's embassy
2013-09-12 * 
Dilbert; I'm looking for the Elbonian embassy.

You found it. It's just me and this card table. If you need asylum, pull up a chair.

Has anyone ever called you and <<<

NSA Agent: Maybe a few days in solitary will make you tell us how you stole the government's data.

Is this the cell with the hidden tunnel?

The what?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'll be at the Elbonian embassy.

NSA Agent: We're going to waterboard you now.

Really? Cool. I don't get touched a lot, so I think I'll enjoy it. Is that all the water you brought?
>>> NSA Agent: <<<
Okay, this got creepy. Abducted by the government
2013-09-09 * 
Wally: <<<
The government arrested Dilbert for stealing back the data their spy software stole from us.
>>> Alice: <<<
Whose side are we on?
>>> Wally: <<<
Well, I'm not crazy about the government.

But Dilbert can be a pain in the Spanx, too.

Have you ever tried apathy? It's awesome.

2013-09-08 * 
Boss: <<<
If you finish your project in twelve months, I'll give you a five percent raise.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I would gladly give up five percent of my future pay to avoid a doubling of my workload.
>>> Boss: <<<
You don't understand. I'm giving you an incentive to work harder.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No, I'm pretty sure you're charging me five percent of my future pay to sit here and feel disgruntled. And it's working. I hate you more than ever and I no longer find meaning in my work My dreams lie broken and empty beneath the ruins of my optimism.
>>> Boss: <<<
I can't tell if your negotiating or dying.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It's a little of both.
>>>
2013-09-07 * 
NSA Agent: You hacked into a government database and stole sensitive information.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Technically, it was my company's information that your spy software stole first. I was just stealing it back. So we're good here, right?  NSA Agent: Yeah, that's how it works.
>>>
2013-09-06 * 
Dilbert: <<<
We lost all of our company data and our backups, too. So I hacked into our government's secret database where they keep records of everything we say or do and got it all back.
>>> Boss: <<<
I feel as if I should be doing something now.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Nah. Everything is working fine.
>>>
2013-09-05 * 
Boss: <<<
I don't need to see your resume. That's the old way of hiring. Now we use data from the Internet to see what you've been up to lately. Ew.

I'll show myself out.
>>> Boss: <<<
You'll understand if I don't shake your hand.

2013-09-04 *

The big tech firms say they no longer care about hiring people who have prestigious degrees. Obviously, they're trying to sucker the rest of us into hiring idiots while they vacuum up the people from the top schools.

Gaaa!!! My day has been one interruption after another!

I put your budget estimates into a spreadsheet as you asked. A well-fertilized shrub sprouted out of my iPad. What does this mean?

That's how you know the budget is done.

Uh-oh. It's that guy.
>>> Coworker: <<<
You never returned any of my messages.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I was busy.
>>> Coworker: <<<
For six months?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Well, no... only for a week. But it would have been awkward to respond after ignoring you for so long.
>>> Coworker: <<<
So your plan was to avoid me forever even though we work on the same floor?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No. I've seen the quality of your work and I figured there was a 60% chance that you would die in a workplace accident that the average idiot could easily avoid. For the record, I'm the one who was trying to avoid this conversation.
>>>
2013-08-31 * 
Boss: <<<
I need a budget estimate for your project.

One billion dollars.

That doesn't sound reasonable.

Please stop being you.

I won't give my opinion because I don't want to influence your recommendation.

Good idea. My well-informed mind is so easily swayed by your charismatic ignorance.

That's not what I'm saying.

Then who did I hear?

2013-08-27 * 
Dilbert: <<<
How'd you bet the black eye?

I was pulling up my blanket in bed. My hand slipped and I punched myself in the face.

Okay, let's make some billion-dollar technology decisions.

I've been asked to explain our disaster preparedness plan. In the event of a famine, turn your keyboard upside down and shake. If it's anything like mine, you'll find a pound and a half of crumbs. In the event of an alien invasion, your best bet is to kill a co-worker to show your allegiance to the lizard-people. In the event of an impending collision with an asteroid, try running in place while the Earth rotates. If you time it right, you'll be on the other side of the planet when the asteroid hits. To prepare for every other type of disaster, I recommend cultivating a taste for human flesh.

Your presentation is a disaster.

And next time you'll be prepared for it.

Wally, this is my brother, Phil, The Prince of Insufficient Light. I asked him to interpret your accomplishments for this quarter. Phil You have 25 alleged accomplishments. Eight of these accomplishments involved simply being on a project team that did something. Nine accomplishments involved fixing problems you created. Five of these are just buzzwords that don't mean anything. And three are duplicates that you reworded to appear different. I'd recommend harvesting his organs, but those probably don't work either.

That's just mean.

Better than I expected. We spent the first 45 minutes trying to get our online collaboration tools to work. Then we couldn't agree on what we were trying to accomplish. I couldn't understand most of the attendees because they were on speakerphones in rooms with bad acoustics. I randomly agreed to a few things, but I don't know what.

No one really knows. Check out our other nine hundred contracts to make sure this one doesn't violate any of those. Keep in mind our five-year strategic plan and all likely changes to tax law.

Allow me to put that in context. There are probably 10,000 books about leadership, and each one has a different approach. And there are millions of real leaders, of which no two are alike. Moreover, every situation is unique and requires a different type of leader. And yet this one author has found a magic formula to transform you from a gullible baboon into a great leader. And that makes sense because all great leaders throughout history achieved success by reading a random book.

You should hope I am lying. Studies show that people who exaggerate their credentials tend to be more effective once hired. That's because misleading people is a valuable business skill.

>>> CEO: <<<
Your use of that folksy saying makes my strategy sound dumb.
>>> Alice: <<<
Why do you care if your strategy is perfect or not?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You just said it's more important to spray your defective stuff on the universe than it is to get things right.
>>> CEO: <<<
"Spray my defective stuff?
>>> Dilbert: Should I have waited for a perfect way to say that?

2013-06-08 * 
Boss: <<<
Alice, I want you to collaborate with Larry.
>>> Alice: <<<
And by collaborate you mean water down my brilliance with this dullard's brain flatulence.
>>> Boss: <<<
She doesn't play well with others.
>>> Alice: <<<
If I were a man, you'd call it confidence.

Wulf: <<<
I was Schrodinger's cat back in the day. That's why I'm alive and dead at the same time. I know the truth about the afterlife because my dead half told my living half all about it. Do you want to know what happens?
>>> Wally: <<<
Stop projecting your curiosity on me.
>>>
2013-06-06 * 
Catbert: <<<
This is Wulf. He used to work for a famous physicist named Schrodinger. He escaped before the experiment was finished and now he's both alive and dead at the same time.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Like a zombie?
>>> Catbert: <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> Wulf: <<<
Wow. I have half a mind to be offended by that.

Say hello to the ephemeral middle manager. But hurry because he won't last long.

Hi, I'm...

Now you just look stupid.

Wally: <<<
Let me know if you have any changes to my first draft.
>>> Coworker: <<<
This literally says the words <<<
blah, blah, blah.
>>> Are you lazy?
>>> Wally: <<<
No, I'm worthless. Lazy would have been one <<<
blah.

Dogbert: <<<
I brought a Nobel-winning economist to tell you why everything you say about fiscal policy is wrong.
>>> Economist: <<<
For starters, if you knew anything about economics you would have a beard.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
The first few minutes are mostly trash talk.
>>> Economist: <<<
Ha! You bathe daily, water-waster!
>>>
2013-06-02 * 
Boss: <<<
A goo manager leads by example. How does it help an engineer to see an example of how to be a middle manager?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's like teaching physics by showing examples of monster truck rallies.
>>> Alice: <<<
Should we say dumb things, too, or have you not started leading by example yet?
>>> Wally: <<<
Now what is he doing/ Are we supposed to do that?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I think he's leading by example now!
>>> Boss: <<<
I'm starting to wonder if everything I read on the Internet is wrong.
>>>
2013-06-01 * 
Interviewer: <<<
We only hire people who fit into our awesome start-up culture.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No problem. I can be a self-conscious hipster if you think that's what keeps the lights on.
>>> Interviewer: <<<
I kind of do.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What would I need besides an earring and headphones? Interview at a start-up
2013-05-31 * 
Dilbert: <<<
...and that's my idea for a start-up. What do you think?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I'm not a big fan of other people being successful, so I'll say the idea is terrible.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Remind me why I talk to you.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
You're a serial entreprenidiot.

2013-05-30 * 
Catbert: <<<
Our es-CEO negotiated an unusually generous severance package. We had to build a giant robotic flea to suck the assets out of the company. The weird part is that it seemed reasonable at the time.

2013-05-29 * 
Boss: <<<
Asok, thanks to my mentoring, someday you will be just like me.
>>> Asok: <<<
Gaaa!!! Someone please drive a stake through my heart! Hurry!
>>> Boss: <<<
Apparently I don't know what mentoring is.
>>>
2013-05-28 * 
Asok: <<<
I'm afraid to give Alice my opinion of her plan.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What's the worst thing that could happen?
>>> Asok: <<<
She could rip off both of my arms and beat me to death with them. Then she could track down my family in India and kill them one by one. Is this your first time giving advice?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I just figured out why no one ever asks for it.
>>>
2013-05-27 * 
Boss: <<<
Carol, why did you send me a link about people who like to dress in animal costumes?
>>> Carol: <<<
It's called the Furry Lifestyle. I thought you might want to try it out.
>>> Boss: <<<
I'll take a look.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What's your end game?
>>> Carol: <<<
If the Furry thing sticks I'll try to get him to go on a safari.

I programmed our robot to make medical diagnoses. It can scan your body using its neutrino sensor. Robot, please demonstrate.
>>> Robot: <<<
Dead man walking!
>>> Boss: <<<
What?
>>> Robot: <<<
Your brain is the size of a dried apricot. Your heart is more cheeseburger than human tissue. You will be dead in eleven days, six hours, and nineteen minutes.
>>> Boss: <<<
Gaaa!!!
>>> Robot: <<<
Why did you program me to hate people?
>>> Wally: <<<
It was easier than inventing a neutrino sensor.

Dogbert: <<<
What is the key to success?
>>> CEO: <<<
Hire the right employees!
>>> Dogbert: <<<
How do you know you hired the right ones?
>>> CEO: <<<
You know because the business is successful.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
So the key to success is circular reasoning?
>>> CEO: <<<
Yes, because circular reasoning is the key.
>>>
2013-05-24 * 
Coworker: <<<
I have no real-world experience and I am incompetent at everything. But unlike any of you, I have a Ph.D., and that means you have to take me seriously.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is pretending allowed?
>>> Coworker: <<<
Totally. It all looks the same to me.
>>>
2013-05-23 * 
Boss: <<<
I hired an overqualified yet incompetent guy to help on your project.
>>> Coworker: <<<
I was happily incompetent for years. Then I got my PhD and people started thinking I could do things. Okay, I'm stumped.
>>>
2013-05-22 * 
Boss: <<<
I'm looking for ideas on how we can improve our corporate culture.
>>> Alice: <<<
You could start by being less of a micromanaging d-bag who hides like a Higgs-boson whenever we need a decision.
>>> Boss: <<<
That didn't help.
>>> Alice: <<<
Will honesty still be taboo in the new culture?
>>>
2013-05-21 * 
CEO: <<<
The secret of our company's success is that we hire good people.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What? Are you saying I'm good? I've never heard a compliment at work. What is that feeling inside me? Is it the thing called self-esteem?
>>> Customer: <<<
Awkward.
>>> CEO: <<<
Just ignore him.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Behold my goodness! Customer Meeting
2013-05-20 * 
Wally: <<<
I'm double-mugging because I heard that passion is necessary for success. By 4pm I'll be so passionate I'll be dating my chair.
>>> Catbert: <<<
Nothing about that sounded right.
>>>
2013-05-19 * 
Boss: <<<
We're replacing our outdated system of annual performance reviews. The new system is called Gramification. It's a hot new trend. Employees can win badges, ribbons, and awards for completing tasks.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Can we opt for the cash value of those badges, ribbons, and awards?
>>> Boss: <<<
They don't have any cash value.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Oh. Like garbage?
>>> Boss: <<<
No, not like garbage! Except in the narrow sense of having no functional, economic, or emotional value. Garbage is something you throw away.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Hand me an award and watch carefully.
>>>
2013-05-18 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Please stop micromanaging me.
>>> Boss: <<<
What? I thought I was coaching and mentoring. Do you want some coaching and mentoring?

I'm not a puppet. Keep your hand out of my colon.

Alice: <<<
Gaaa!!! Every time I leave my cubicle, someone puts a document on my chair! I have an in-ox! Stop leaving stuff in my chair!!!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How do you keep your cubicle so neat?
>>> Wally: <<<
I put everything on Alice's chair.
>>>
2013-05-16 * 
Dilbert: <<<
If I complain about a co-worker, can you handle it discreetly and keep me out of it?
>>> Boss: <<<
Yes. Dilbert says you're a worthless piece of garbage. He guessed it was you.
>>>
2013-05-15 * 
Dilbert: <<<
As you requested, I researched all of the best-selling books on the topic of leadership. Apparently, leadership is the product of sociopathic tendencies plus luck. All other personality traits are inactive ingredients.
>>> Wally: <<<
Did you actually read all of those books?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I only needed to know they were all different.
>>>
2013-05-14 * 
CEO: <<<
I'm reading a book about what it takes to be a great leader. Do you know what Steve Jobs, Warren Buffett, Gandhi, and Ryan Seacrest have in common?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
None of them read this book.
>>> CEO: <<<
And they are carbon-based life-forms.

2013-05-13 * 
Wally: <<<
Wearable computing is the next big thing. This is my prototype of a necklace computer. Prepare to be shocked.

Did you just talk him into wearing a remotely controlled shock collar?
>>> Wally: <<<
People think I have no goals.

2013-05-12 * 
Boss: <<<
I'm looking for an employee who is creative.
>>> Interviewee: <<<
That's me. I have ADHD and dylsexia. I'm also bipolar and schizophrenic.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Checking the Internet... Well... that's surprising. Each of his conditions is highly correlated with creativity.
>>> Interviewee: <<<
Are you a normal?
>>> Boss: <<<
I... think so.
>>> Interviewee: <<<
Wow. I feel sorry for you. It must be hard going through life without any creativity.
>>> Boss: <<<
What's happening here?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It might be some sort of creative thing.
>>>
2013-05-11 * 
Boss: <<<
A good leader listens to his underlings.
>>> Alice: <<<
Fine. I've overworked and underpaid. I hate my co-workers, I don't have the resources to do my job, and we have no clear strategy.
>>> Boss: <<<
No wonder leaders listen. It's a lot easier than fixing all of that stuff.
>>>
2013-05-10 * 
Boss: <<<
Employees are in a furor over our new policy and banning telecommuting.
>>> CEO: <<<
Really? You mean we found a way to make them stop obsessing over my pay package? Try canceling all maternity leave and see if it makes them stop talking about telecommuting.
>>>
2013-05-09 * 
Client: <<<
Do you mind if I check my email?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Yes, I would consider it rude.
>>> Client: <<<
Do you mind if I use the ladies room?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Of course not. Oh.
>>>
2013-05-08 * 
Boss: <<<
Wally, I'd like you to meet the CEO of the company that is our biggest customer.
>>> Wally: <<<
I'd shake but I have coffee in one hand, my random drug test sample in the other, and I don't want either one to get cold. Hey, I'm not the one who made this awkward.
>>>
2013-05-07 * 
CEO: <<<
I canceled all telecommuting because there is so much value in having co-workers interact with each other in the office.
>>> Boss: <<<
Yes, it makes perfect sense. We want to get all of the value of casual interactions.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Do you want to see a picture of  my infected toe?
>>>
2013-05-06 * 
Boss: <<<
And you are...?
>>> Coworker: <<<
I've worked for you for years. I was telecommuting, but now our company policy forbids it, so here I am.
>>> Boss: <<<
Did I give you any assignments in those four years?
>>> Coworker: <<<
No, and you can imagine how disappointed I am now.
>>>
2013-05-05 * 
Carol: <<<
It's your surgeon. He says he might have left something inside you.
>>> Boss: <<<
What??! A sponge? A scalpel?
>>> Carol: <<<
No... his watch. And... his car keys... and wallet. He says he used your torso to store his valuables while he went for a run.
>>> Boss: <<<
Meow!
>>> Carol: <<<
I'll ask about that.
>>>
2013-05-04 * 
Boss: <<<
Experts say I can appear charismatic by setting high expectations.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Or maybe you could improve your charisma by fixing your character flaws instead of making me work harder.
>>> Boss: <<<
No, I'm fairly sure the problem with my charisma is on your end.
>>>
2013-05-03 * 
Carol: <<<
My 12-year-old wants to know what career would prevent him from being replaced by a robot.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I've met your son, and I'm pretty sure he could be replaced by a hammer.
>>> Carol: <<<
This took an ugly turn.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Maybe the robots can use him as furniture.
>>>
2013-05-02 * 
Dilbert: <<<
So that's my problem, and I'm curious how you would try to solve it if you were me.
>>> Boss: <<<
You actually care about my opinion?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Yes, I really do.
>>> Wally: <<<
Are you any closer to solving your problem?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Yup. So far I've eliminated all of the choices that idiots would make.
>>>
2013-05-01 * 
Boss: <<<
Underlings, listen to the charismatic tone of my deep, confident voice!
>>> Alice: <<<
Should we listen to the content, too, or will that just confuse us?
>>> Boss: <<<
I'll have to do some research and get back to you.

Asok, the secret to success is to do what you love and stick to it.

Boss: <<<
Your bonuses this year will be based on the usual formula. 50% is based on pure luck. And 50% is based on the performance of people you have never met. This year, the luck factor was good. Our industry experienced huge consumer demand. Unfortunately, people who you have never met did a bad job of marketing and sales are terrible. And for that, you engineers must be punished. No bonuses for you. Luckily for me, my bonus is based on how well I can convince you idiots to work hard while getting no bonuses. I don't like to brag, but I'm fairly sure I'm nailing it.
>>>
2013-04-27 * 
Asok: <<<
While we have this chance encounter, I wonder if you could share your secrets for career success.
>>> CEO: <<<
Avoid associating with losers because they will lower your standards and suck the energy out of you. Would you mind taking the stairs?
>>>
2013-04-26 * 
Asok: <<<
I have a fool-proof plan for success. I will read a book on how rich people think. Then I will start thinking this way.
>>> Book: <<<
Rich people think about their shoes a log.
>>> Asok: <<<
I can do that!

2013-04-25 * 
Boss: <<<
My parents taught me that if I worked hard, I could be anything I wanted.

And you chose... this? His parents sound like morons.

Maybe he didn't work hard.

2013-04-24 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I wonder if I should rely more on my intuition to make decisions.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
You mean guessing?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No. Guessing is totally different from intuition because of the... um... These things make sense in my head!
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Is there room in there with all of the intuition?

Marketing Guy: We need to know how our customers live and work. I'd like each of you to write fictional biographies that describe the daily lives of our typical customers. I feel you're not taking this seriously.

It is time for you to learn about trust, Asok. Let me show you. Turn around. This is called the <<<
trust fall.
>>> You fall backward and trust me to catch you... go.
>>> Asok: <<<
Why didn't you catch me?!!!
>>> Wally: <<<
It wouldn't be trust if it worked every time.

What kind of lesson is that?
>>> Wally: <<<
This is how I tolerate my co-workers.

Dilbert: <<<
Have you heard any rumors about what is driving our boss's decisions lately?

He's thwarting a rival within the company by offering only prohibitively expensive engineering solutions.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
My work has meaning, but it's not the good kind.
>>>
2013-04-18 * 
Boss: <<<
Your plan is technically sound, but I have to reject it for political reasons I can't share.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'll come back with some plans that are irrational nonsense and see if they make it past your filter.

I'll always wonder if there was a better way to handle that.

The best way to evaluate an investment fund is to look at its misleading claims of past performance. The Dogbert Hedge Fund beat the market average for a three-week period... that one time.

The biggest tech companies want to win the battle for your living room. But they are unwisely focusing on developing better TV sets. Today I give you me design for a fully digital couch. It has all of the features you would expect, including a butt warmer, surround sound, bottle opener and back scratcher. But you can also control the lights, curtains, temperature and TV by using your buttocks like a mouse on the seat cushion. This is a loft click and... this is a right. The prototype arrives tomorrow, and I'll be testing it for the next six months. Maybe I'll sell my house.

What?
>>> Robot: <<<
We meet again.

2013-04-12 *

You contradicted me in a meeting today and I didn't appreciate it. I'm no allowed to use my fist of death on humans, but you robots have no legal rights. It's not personal. This is how I get my cardio.

He died in my cubicle. That's all I'm saying.

2013-03-16 * 
Alice: <<<
We bought a start-up just so we could get the engineers, including you. Do something that's worth a million dollars. I want to see what that looks like.
>>> Coworker: <<<
You don't sound entirely sincere.
>>> Alice: <<<
Can you turn my Diet Coke into wine?
>>>
2013-03-15 * 
Boss: <<<
This is one of the engineers that works at the start-up we purchased. We bought the company just to get the engineers. Basically, each engineer cost us a million dollars.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm so underpaid!
>>> Engineer: <<<
That money didn't go to me!
>>>
2013-03-14 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I got kicked out of a North Elbonian labor camp for working too hard. It was the first time I had ever experienced meaningful work and I got carried away.
>>> Boss: <<<
And your name is...?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Seriously? I was gone for one week!
>>>
2013-03-13 * 
Dilbert: <<<
The North Elbonians accused me of being a spy and put me in a forced labor camp. It sounds worse than it was. I had a private office and all I did was app development.
>>> Boss: <<<
How did you escape?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I didn't. I took a personal day to tell you how much you suck.
>>>
2013-03-12 * 
Elbonian: <<<
Halt! You have entered the territorial mud of North Elbonia! I'll text you a link to a web page about our forced labor camps. You might like them.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
This looks better than my current job.
>>> Elbonian: <<<
No rush, but I have an appointment to capture a Canadian at eleven.
>>>
2013-03-11 * 
Boss: <<<
I need you to do a site inspection at our Elbonian facility. It's located in a disputed territory on the border of the totalitarian state of North Elbonia. Was that enough foreshadowing or should I say something about how they treat spies?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No, you nailed it.
>>>
2013-03-10 * 
Boss: <<<
Wally, you have accomplished none of your goals. I have to let you go.
>>> Wally: <<<
Actually, I accomplished a lot. I spent the past ten years creating a tangle of undocumented programming code. Every one of our major systems is linked to it. If I don't enter a password every day, the entire company will go into a technology death spiral. If you value your job, you'll give me a huge raise and dance on this table like a monkey!!!
>>> Boss: <<<
Let's call it a tie.
>>> Wally: <<<
Yeah, I'm good with that.
>>>
2013-03-09 * 
Mordac: <<<
I am Mordac, the preventer of information services, and I forbid you from using the shared color printer for rough drafts!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That sounds reasonable, which makes me wonder what you're up to. Why did you remove the color printer?
>>> Mordac: <<<
It was hardly ever used. Two Months Later
2013-03-08 * 
Boss: <<<
Experts say the best leaders have a good sense of humor. I'm an awesome leader, therefore I must be hilarious.
>>> Wally: <<<
I can't tell if I should laugh at that.
>>> Boss: <<<
That's because you're not a leader.
>>>
2013-03-07 * 
Dogbert: <<<
Honesty is the best policy... whenever you think lying won't work. Otherwise, lying is awesome. It's like a freakin' superpower!
>>> Ratbert: <<<
Why am I here?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I speak truth to the powerless.
>>>
2013-03-06 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Studies show that companies with a high level of trust in employees also perform the best.
>>> Boss: <<<
If you ever start performing well, I'll trust you, too.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
This didn't go the way I hoped.
>>> Boss: <<<
What kind of scam are you trying to pull?
>>>
2013-03-05 * 
CEO: <<<
Oh, great. I got here too early. Now I'll need to make small talk with this underling. I don't know what to say to these people. I need to find an area of common interest. I make my own gold coins now. This one has my face on the front and the jumbo jet that carries my superyacht on the back.
>>>
2013-03-04 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Should we buy the maintenance plan or just take our chances? What do you prefer?
>>> Boss: <<<
I prefer to punish you for buying the maintenance plan and going over budget, but I also don't mind firing you for not buying it if we later need it. Which one of us has a better job?
>>>
2013-03-03 * 
Coworker: <<<
Do you mind if I rummage through the trash in the technology lab?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Um, okay.
>>> Coworker: <<<
I'm getting back to my hunter-gatherer roots. Score! These old power cords sell on Ebay for up to $3 apiece. Ha ha! I'm a genius who turns trash into gold! How's that compare to whatever you're doing here.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Well, I'm removing valuable features from our product so we can.. gouge our customers with the... upgrade.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Wow. Your life is a total waste.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Not if I sell the power cord.
>>>
2013-03-02 * 
Dilbert: <<<
The upgrade could make our network unstable.
>>> Boss: <<<
You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I interpret your folksy response to mean I should upgrade the network despite the risks.
>>> Boss: <<<
No, I'm saying I'll break your eggs if the network goes down.
>>>

CEO: <<<
Shakespeare said some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em. I wonder which one I am.
>>> Catbert: <<<
Some steal from shareholders and call it greatness.
>>> CEO: <<<
Greatness of the fourth kind.

2013-02-28 * 
Boss: <<<
I'm what you call a natural leader because of my communication skills.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Did I miss the context for this conversation? I have no idea why you're talking.
>>> Boss: <<<
Why does everything you say annoy me? Is it because you're a great communicator?
>>>
2013-02-27 * 
Boss: <<<
I hired The Dogbert Ergonomic Consulting Company to tell us about the health benefits of standing.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Standing be good.
>>> Boss: <<<
That's it?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
The topic isn't as complicated as you might think.
>>>
2013-02-26 * 
Lawyer: <<<
A small company is suing us for patent infringement. We'll be fine unless the court somehow finds twelve citizens who aren't smart enough to get out of jury duty yet are inexplicably able to do math.
>>> Juror: <<<
We recommend an award of whatever the square root of 22 over zero is.
>>>
2013-02-25 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I added all of the product features that each of you demanded. Now our product is a worthless hodgepodge of complexity. I appreciate your input. I couldn't have failed without you.
>>> Boss: <<<
Teamwork!
>>>
2013-02-24 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Are you coming to the code mocking?
>>> Asok: <<<
The what?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Code mocking is an engineering tradition. It happens whenever a software project is handed to a new engineer. The new engineer is required to mock the previous engineer's work in a public way. We spectators get to vote on whether the old code is killed or spared.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Ha ha! His code is hilariously inefficient! Ouch. Chest pain.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!
>>> Coworker: <<<
Gaaa!! The code is offending my engineering sensibilities! It's killing me!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I forgot to mention that sometimes the code wins.
>>>
2013-02-23 * 
Boss: <<<
Our engineers built a nuclear rocket to blast an incoming asteroid out of its collision course with Earth. But we didn't use the approved corporate font on the nose cone and we missed the launch window trying to erase it. Now what are we going to do with a nuclear rocket?
>>> CEO: <<<
Well, the moon has always been a jerk.
>>>
2013-02-22 * 
Boss: <<<
Good news! We were the low bidder for The United Nation's asteroid intercept missile. The fate of Earth depends on your combined talents plus my management skills. Wally, you're in charge of fissile material, which I assume is a type of soda.
>>>
2013-02-21 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I found a backdoor into NASA's asteroid tracking satellite. I see that a big one is heading directly toward... Gaaaa!!!
>>> Dogbert: <<<
What? What?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I must fill my final days with love.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
You ruined my ears, jerk!
>>>
2013-02-20 * 
CEO: <<<
The CEO of Apple says a leader should admit when he's wrong. That won't work for me because I'm never wrong. The best I can do is admit when other people are wrong.
>>> Boss: <<<
That sort of misses the point.
>>> CEO: <<<
Well, I humbly admit you're wrong.
>>>
2013-02-19 * 
Boss: <<<
The new software will interrupt you every five minutes so you don't get carpal tunnel.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Aren't you worried the software will replace you? hee-hee!
>>> Boss: <<<
I don't get that.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's why it's funny.
>>>
2013-02-18 * 
Boss: <<<
We need to have a sense of urgency.
>>> Wally: <<<
I use most of my energy pretending to work, but I can add a layer of fake urgency if you really need it.
>>> Boss: <<<
What?
>>> Wally: <<<
I gotta go! I have vague goals to achieve!
>>>
2013-02-17 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I can't wait to see the changes I asked you to make on the interface. Our last meeting was two months ago. You must be finished by now.
>>> Coworker: <<<
I haven't started yet. I had a few questions. I figured I'd ask you about them the next time we talked. In the meantime I only did work for people who yelled at me every day. Micromanagement has a bad reputation, but I'm not too proud to say I need it.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Okay... well, I'm optimistic that you can make those changes for me by next week.
>>> Coworker: <<<
I probably should have asked my questions.
>>>
2013-02-16 * 
CEO: <<<
Experts say we need to empower employees with <<<
values.
>>> So I guess we need some values, whatever the heck those are.
>>> Boss: <<<
I think it's like "Don't run with scissors."
>>> CEO: <<<
Let's start with that and see if they stop asking for raises.
>>>
2013-02-15 * 
Boss: <<<
Starting next week, our meetings will be <<<
stand-ups" with no chairs, so we'll be more focused.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So you examined all of the problems in the company and decided the root cause was chairs?
>>> Boss: <<<
We're also loosening the dress code.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So our problems are chairs and pants?
>>>
2013-02-14 * 
Boss: <<<
How's it going, underling?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
My long hours and insane workload are causing fatigue, depression, and organ failure. I'll probably be dead in a month.
>>> Boss: <<<
When did people stop saying <<<
fine?
>>>
2013-02-13 * 
CEO: <<<
We need to form an emotional connection with our customers.
>>> Wally: <<<
Does fantasizing count?
>>> CEO: <<<
Trade seats with me.
>>> Wally: <<<
I'm doing it right now.
>>>
2013-02-12 * 
Boss: <<<
Today I learned that the secret of good managing is hiring people who are smarter than I am. Maybe I'll try that next time.
>>>
2013-02-11 * 
Coworker: <<<
My hobby is restoring old cars.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That strikes me as slightly less useful than Wally's hobby of doing absolutely nothing.
>>> Wally: <<<
Do you restore other kinds of garbage or just cars?
>>>
2013-02-10 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I'm working at home today. It will be as if we're co-workers.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Ugh. This madness must stop! You should check your Facebook page to see what's new. You should check Twitter.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm almost finished with Facebook.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Did you get my LinkedIn request?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'll check.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I send you some links to funny websites.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Cool! I just spent ten hours at my computer and I can't remember why I was sitting there in the first place.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
You were going to check your stocks.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Okay. That sounds right. Two Hours Later. Two Hours Later. Two Hours Later.
>>>
2013-02-09 * 
Boss: <<<
What's this?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It's corporate yoga. I'm using victory and power poses to trick my brain into releasing testosterone to make me more of a leader.
>>> Alice: <<<
I don't know what this is, but I want in.
>>>
2013-02-08 * 
Boss: <<<
This isn't what I wanted.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I know. But given your unclear email and your unwillingness to answer follow-up questions, I decided to do whatever entertained me.
>>> Boss: <<<
Do we have a problem here?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No, this totally works for me.
>>>
2013-02-07 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Studies show it takes ten thousand hours of practice to be great at anything.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I would think a willingness to practice the same thing for ten thousand hours is a mental disorder.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That makes me feel better about my mediocrity.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
You're welcome.
>>>
2013-02-06 * 
Boss: <<<
The company will no longer offer free beer on Fridays. It started as a team-building experience, but it degenerated into forklift jousting in the warehouse.
>>> Wally: <<<
I'm going all <<<
Boardwalk Empire" on you now, Volstead!
>>> Boss: <<<
I hope that means something good.
>>>
2013-02-05 * 
Alice: <<<
I've learned to control reality by creating fake websites and doing search engine optimization.
>>> Boss: <<<
Did you hear about the idiopathy epidemic? They symptoms include pointy hair and gullibility. The only treatment is for someone else to slap the victim.
>>> Alice: <<<
Ask for it like you mean it.
>>>
2013-02-04 * 
Alice: <<<
Asok, your meeting stole an hour of my life. According to international law, I may now claim you as my indentured servant.
>>> Asok: <<<
Wow. That... actually is a law.
>>> Alice: <<<
Or I'm really good at SEO.
>>>
2013-02-03 * 
Boss: <<<
You remind me of another young person I hired years ago. She was full of hope and optimism and she wore a permanent smile. Her name was Alice. As time passed, she devolved into an angry, hateful creature. No one knows what caused it.
>>> Interviewee: <<<
How long did it take?
>>> Boss: <<<
About a week.
>>> Interviewee: <<<
Apparently, you're a monster who creates a toxic workplace and you lack the self-awareness to realize it!
>>> Boss: <<<
Someone broke your record.
>>> Alice: <<<
Shut up.

2013-02-02 * 
Computer: <<<
Based on your internet history, you might be dumb enough to enjoy extreme sports. Click here to buy a ticket to base jump from the International Space Station.

I think the internet is trying to kill me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
We call it <<<
machine learning.
>>>
2013-02-01 * 
Boss: <<<
And I need it by next week.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I will devote 3.7% of my energy to it. I can give you more if you do your job of setting priorities for my 27 projects.
>>> Boss: <<<
Can't you set the priorities?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Sure. This one just went to 1.7%.
>>>
2013-01-31 * 
CEO: <<<
Our machine learning technology allows us to track customer preferences and use that knowledge to manipulate them.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That seems like the step that happens right before the machines take over the earth and annihilate all humans.
>>> CEO: <<<
There's always one person in every crowd who says that.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Not for much longer, apparently.
>>>
2013-01-30 * 
CEO: <<<
You might be wondering why I called this meeting.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Well, I see a CEO, a company lawyer, and two salespeople. Those jobs are highly correlated with psychopathy. My guess is that you invited me here to disembowel me.
>>> CEO: <<<
It was rhetorical!
>>>
2013-01-29 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I read an article that says employees are happiest when their jobs give them a sense of meaning. What is this <<<
sense of meaning" thing and how can I get some of it? Because I feel like a bag of organ meat draped over an electric fence.
>>> Boss: <<<
Almost the same thing.
>>>
2013-01-28 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Did you make the software changes I suggested?
>>> Coworker: <<<
No, because I reflexively disagree with ever suggestion that anyone ever makes.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You're very reasonable.
>>> Coworker: <<<
No, I'm a total jer... wait, what did you just do there?
>>>
2013-01-27 * 
Wally: <<<
I decided to be proactive and push back my deliverable deadline by a year.
>>> Boss: <<<
That' snot being proactive. That's the opposite of proactive!
>>> Wally: <<<
You said you want employees to be empowered and now you're criticizing my decision. That's just great. Now my morale is bad, too! I can't be proactive. I can't be empowered. And now I can't even be happy! You've bungled everything! You're a big bungler!
>>> Boss: <<<
Get out of my office.
>>> Wally: <<<
Well, say goodbye to the open-door policy!
>>>
2013-01-26 * 
Wally: <<<
I had a busy week. I recycled all of our old software and donated the zeroes and ones to math programs in poor towns. My dream is that someday every child will be able to count to one.
>>>
2013-01-25 * 
Coworker: <<<
I assigned three more engineers to help on your project. One is on paternity leave, one is in the hospital, and one doesn't start for another month. If there's anything else you need, please hesitate to ask.
>>>
2013-01-24 * 
Sales Rep: Our model XR35 is the only one that will work in your situation. The other models would be nightmares.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Okay, we'll take the XR35.
>>> Sales Rep: <<<
Oops. It appears we are out of stock.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
This is the part where your credibility comes into questions.
>>> Sales Rep: <<<
Have you looked at the XP9? I think it would be perfect.
>>>
2013-01-23 * 
CEO: <<<
I have a vision that our next product will be a tablet computer the size of a dime. Users will lick it and attach it to their eyeballs. Can you finish that in a month?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I can fail at any speed you like.
>>>
2013-01-22 * 
Boss: <<<
Good news, Asok: I have decided to be your mentor.
>>> Asok: <<<
Waaaa!!!! Why me?? Why me?? I wish I were dead!!!
>>> Boss: <<<
You cry ugly. I think we need to work on that.
>>> Asok: <<<
Waaaa!!!
>>>
2013-01-21 * 
CEO: <<<
Put my name above yours on all of your patent applications. Because your brain, without the genius of my leadership, would be like a desiccated turnip. All you are, and all you will ever be...
>>> Dilbet: <<<
Right... got it... name on patent...
>>>
2013-01-20 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I can't hear you. There's too much background noise and echo in your end.
>>> Computer: <<<
Gerple Murmp.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I see a smudgy thing that might be your head, but I don't know what you're saying. Your accent is too thick. I can't...

Okay, you go.
>>> Computer: <<<

>>> Dilbert: <<<
What?
>>> Computer: <<<
Mungow.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Did you say...
>>> Computer: <<<
Plurb.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You're acting as if I agreed to something, but I don't even know what the topic is. I see you waving goodbye, so you must think we're done.
>>> Boss: <<<
Was your call a success?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Better than anything I've done all week.
>>>
2013-01-19 * 
Alice: <<<
We need to talk about my workload.
>>> Boss: <<<
Okay. I just emailed you two more assignments that I need finished by tomorrow.
>>> Alice: <<<
You are literally killing me.
>>> Boss: <<<
I call it extreme managing.
>>>
2013-01-18 * 
Boss: <<<
A study says that 74% of managers think they are above average. That means that 36% of managers aren't aware that they are above average too.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
The way I look at it, you're all in the top 110%.
>>> Boss: <<<
Exactly. Thank you.
>>>
2013-01-17 * 
Coworker: <<<
Hi, I'm Allen, from Sales.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Dilbert. Your handshake feels like a wet sock full of macaroni and cheese. It makes me wish we never met.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Please let go of my hand.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It's moist and squishy.
>>>
2013-01-16 * 
Boss: <<<
Do not fear change because change is good.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Actually, studies show that any big changes in a person's life vastly increase the odds of sickness and death.
>>> Wally: <<<
Are you trying to kill us?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I can't feel my arm!
>>>
2013-01-15 * 
Boss: <<<
When I asked you to manage my Twitter account I assumed you knew I was expecting inspirational tweets. So far, all you've tweeted under my name are racist rants, misspelled jokes, and links to terrorist websites.
>>> Carol: <<<
To be fair, every one of those tweets was inspirational to someone.
>>>
2013-01-14 * 
Boss: <<<
Carol, create a Twitter account under my name and send out witty tweets every day.
>>> Carol: <<<
Buwhahahaha! I hold in my hands the power to destroy your career and your reputation!
>>> Boss: <<<
Every now and then I question my strategy of abusing my employees for personal gain.
>>>
2013-01-13 * 
Carol: <<<
Do you want extra legroom on your flight? It costs more.
>>> Boss: <<<
Yes.
>>> Carol: <<<
Do you want an aisle seat? That costs extra.
>>> Boss: <<<
Yes.
>>> Carol: <<<
Do you want a no-baby section? It costs extra.
>>> Boss: <<<
Yes.
>>> Carol: <<<
Extra bag?
>>> Boss: <<<
Yes.
>>> Carol: <<<
Meal?
>>> Boss: <<<
Yes.
>>> Carol: <<<
Priority boarding?
>>> Boss: <<<
Yes.
>>> Carol: <<<
In-flight entertainment? Wi-fi? Flight insurance? We're almost done. Just twelve more questions. Your ticket comes to $27,689. And it's only three stops!
>>> Boss: <<<
No let's do the return flight. One hour later.
>>>
2013-01-12 * 
Boss: <<<
I had to lay off seven engineers and... I need you to pick up those functions.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Wow! I feel a weight has been lifted from my chest. Now that my failure is guaranteed, I no longer feel the stress of trying to succeed! I don't know how to thank you for this.
>>> Boss: <<<
This didn't go the way I hoped.
>>>
2013-01-11 * 
Catbert: <<<
Studies say employees prefer having a good boss over getting a raise. So instead of giving raises, pretend to be less dysfunctional. It's cheaper. Bwahahahaha!!!
>>> Boss: <<<
You're a creepy little dude.
>>>
2013-01-10 * 
Dogbert: <<<
Research shows that your best customers are creepy bearded guys. That same group also buys a high volume of potato chips and tissues.
>>> Boss: <<<
How's that help us?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Two words: Combo Pack.
>>>
2013-01-09 * 
Boss: <<<
Do we have any actionable analytics from our big data in the cloud?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Yes, the data shows that my productivity plunges whenever you learn new jargon.
>>> Boss: <<<
Maybe in-memory computing will accelerate your applications.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Plunge, plunge, plunge.
>>>
2013-01-08 * 
Coworker: <<<
Did you finish the design according to my specs?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Yep.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Hypothetically, if I had forgotten to mention several features, would that be a problem? And let's say the deadline is still the same.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No problem. I always plan my schedule around your incompetence.
>>>
2013-01-07 * 
Wally: <<<
This week I tested a source of energy that can power organic devices. It's made from plant seeds and water.
>>> Boss: <<<
Is the energy source called coffee?
>>> Wally: <<<
Let's talk about Dilbert's project. I hear it's a mess.
>>>
2013-01-06 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I can't get one of my team members to do any work. I'm hoping you can talk to his boss.
>>> Boss: <<<
I don't want to make waves.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It's your job to make waves! They pay you to make waves, you worthless pile of stupidity! Oops.
>>> Wally: <<<
I heard you made waves. How'd that work out?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Surprisingly bad.
>>>
2013-01-05 * 
Boss: <<<
I need you to help prepare me for my meeting tomorrow. Write up some answers to the questions we could never anticipate.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I wouldn't expect much out of my first draft.
>>>
2013-01-04 * 
Dogbert: <<<
I got a job as a news manufacturer for an online media company. I quote people out of context, add misleading headlines and tie it all up with a snarky bow.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I thought the news occurred naturally.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
"Entineer Thinks News is Magic.
>>>
2013-01-03 * 
Boss: <<<
We need to foster more of a start-up culture to drive innovation.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So we get to dress casually, work flex hours, feel that our work is valued, and get equity in the company.
>>> Boss: <<<
What would be the name of a culture where people work hard but don't get any of those things you just mentioned.
>>>
2013-01-02 * 
Catbert: <<<
A good leader puts his team ahead of his own ego.
>>> Boss: <<<
What do great leaders do? I'm thinking it's the opposite, right?
>>> Catbert: <<<
They don't do what you just did.
>>> Boss: <<<
They don't be awesome?
>>>
2013-01-01 * 
Dilbert: <<<
A fresh new year is upon us and I am brimming with optimism. Ugh. Our network at work is down because my pointy-haired boss wouldn't let me upgrade the software. Now I need to work all night to fix it. Maybe this means the next 364 days will be extra awesome.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Yeah. That's how it works.
>>>
2012-12-31 * 
Alice: <<<
Have you seen Wally?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
He's been in the men's room for two days. He used to leave when he was done reading the paper, but he switched to an iPad and now he doesn't know when he's finished.
>>> Alice: <<<
He has to come out to eat.
>>> Pizza Guy: <<<
I have a pizza for the third stall.

Dogbert: <<<
I finished ghostwriting your autobiography.
>>> CEO: <<<
"I was ridiculously lucky. The End.
>>> I was hoping you'd include something about all of my hard work.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
You didn't work any harder than your gardener, and he lives in his truck.
>>> CEO: <<<
What about my vision and intuition?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
My first draft had a chapter on your hallucinations and magical thinking. But I covered that ground with the title: "I'm A Delusional Sociopath And You Can Too."
>>> CEO: <<<
I'm starting to regret paying you in advance.
>>>
2012-12-29 * 
CEO: <<<
I'm reorganizing the company and giving every manager a new job.
>>> Boss: <<<
Why?
>>> CEO: <<<
You're over-thinking it.
>>>
2012-12-28 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I've been aggressive recently.
>>> Wally: <<<
I haven't noticed.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I think my testosterone is all jacked up because I won the company's online trivia contest. Not get out of my way, useless worm.
>>> Wally: <<<
Okay, I'm starting to see it.

2012-12-27 * 
Catbert: <<<
I got a report that you've been bullying co-workers.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's dumb. I make friendly suggestions about how people could waste less of my time and it looks like bullying.
>>> Catbert: <<<
Let's schedule a time to talk more about this.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Or-- just a friendly suggestion-- you could not waste my freakin' time.

2012-12-26 * 
Boss: <<<
Asok, I need to teach you to be more assertive in meetings.

Dial it back a little.
>>> Asok: <<<
I hope you die quickly?

Dogbert: <<<
Merry Christmas. I got you the gift of absolutely nothing. Nothing to unwrap, nothing to clutter the house, nothing to return, nothing to assemble, and not a single thing to feel guilty about.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You totally get me.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
It was the least I could do.

Boss: <<<
I hired the Dogbert Ad Company to build some deceptive and abusive ads for our mobile app.

Dilbert: <<<
Gaaa!!!
>>> Boss: <<<
Did you find the snake in your cubicle?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What the...?
>>> Boss: <<<
I put it there because I'm trying to motivate you with a culture of fear.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That only works in the short term!
>>> Boss: <<<
A leader takes the first step without knowing where the next step will be. So get to work, and by they way, one of the urinals is electrified. It's only set to stun, so don't be a baby about it.

His office plant is clear.

The bad apple you hired is ruining the rest of us.

>>> Dilbert: <<<
Walk it off.

Coworker: <<<
I'm the new bad apple. I'll be joining your project. In the interest of full disclosure, this is totally contagious.
>>> Wally: <<<
I'm immune, but not for reasons I'm proud of.
>>> Coworker: <<<
You must be Wally.
>>>
2012-12-20 * 
Boss: <<<
Our CEO says I need to motivate you with a feeling of engagement, not higher pay. The long-term goal is to get you to pay us for the privilege of working here. I heard words I didn't know were words.
>>> CEO: <<<
Try giving her more engagement.
>>>
2012-12-19 * 
CEO: <<<
Before I make my decision, I'd like to ask for your opinions. It's supposed to make you feel "engaged."

And you actually plan to listen to us?
>>> CEO: <<<
I'm hoping it will look that way on the outside.

I need a second opinion on a job applicant. His name is J.B. Hopper. He dresses in a bunny costume and he's had seventeen jobs in two years.

Your work history suggests that you might be a job-hopper.

Oh, really? Well, I should hop all over you for saying that!

I thought you would be more passive.

Wow. You cannot stop stereotyping.

2012-12-16 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Let's meet before the project meeting to go over a few things.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Nice try. We chronically late people know when we're being played. Your pre-meeting is a trick to get me to show up on time for the real meeting. But that won't work because poor planning isn't the cause of my chronic lateness. I make people wait for me because I enjoy the power and I don't care about anyone's feelings.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Fine. I'll see you at the project meeting at ten.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Nice try. I know the meeting is at 10:30.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How do you keep a job?
>>> Coworker: <<<
That attitude is exactly why I don't like people.
>>>
2012-12-15 * 
Boss: <<<
Did you finish the tasks we talked about in the last meeting?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No, because your communication skills are so poor that I had no idea I was supposed to do a task.
>>> Wally: <<<
Did I have a task?

How was your productivity today?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I know you're mocking me.
>>>
2012-12-13 * 
Wally: <<<
I don't know if I should focus on my strengths or strengthen my weaknesses. Or should I have a bias for action and not waste time sharpening any of my skills?
>>> Boss: <<<
Which path gets you to do actual work?
>>> Wally: <<<
I sense a coldness to your mentoring.
>>>
2012-12-12 * 
Boss: <<<
Some of the most famous geniuses in the world slept only four hours per night. I'm doing four hours a night too because you know what they say: correlation is the same thing as causation.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No one says that.
>>> Boss: <<<
Oh, right. And I should take the word of an oversleeper.
>>>
2012-12-11 * 
Boss: <<<
Ted, the merger has made your job redundant. As a reward for your years of hard work, feel free to use one of our cardboard boxes to get your junk out of here. Uh-oh. It looks like we forgot to hide the good boxes.
>>>
2012-12-10 * 
Boss: <<<
Our CEO has promised that the merger will cause no layoffs.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is that because he's too incompetent to eliminate obvious redundancies or is he just lying?
>>> Boss: <<<
Can you give me more choices?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
A brain parasite is making him say stupid stuff?
>>>
2012-12-09 * 
Boss: <<<
We can make this a great place to work by following the golden rule. Treat others as you would want them to treat you.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's dumb.
>>> Boss: <<<
It's not dumb!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Let's test your rule. Would you like it if someone gave you a hundred dollars?
>>> Boss: <<<
Yes.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Okay. So give me a hundred dollars. Or else forever live as a hypocrite who doesn't follow his own rule.
>>> Wally: <<<
Snork!
>>> Alice: <<<
Snork!

I hate your engineering guts!!!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
At least you're making sense now.

2012-12-08 * 
Boss: <<<
Carol, I can't give you a raise this year because you didn't show enough initiative.
>>> Carol: <<<
I just formed a grass-roots movement to convince the government to raise taxes on people at your income level. Checkmate.

Alice, do you have any valuable career advice?
>>> Alice: <<<
Work so hard that it destroys your health and crowds out any chance of having a personal life.
>>> Asok: <<<
Wouldn't that make me... unhappy?
>>> Alice: <<<
You didn't ask for happiness advice.

I need you to assemble a huge amount of totally incomprehensible data. Make it boring so no one looks at it too closely. I'm aiming for quantity over quality.

I have a bad feeling about this.

No one would pay you to feel good.

2012-12-04 * 
Boss: <<<
Our millennial employees keep quitting because of our bureaucracy and poor communication.
>>> CEO: <<<
Form three task forces to look into it. But don't tell any of the task forces that there are two others doing the same thing.
>>> Boss: <<<
Should I give you regular updates?
>>> CEO: <<<
Nah.
>>>
2012-12-03 * 
Boss: <<<
Why do you want to leave your current job?
>>> Interviewee: <<<
My boss is a pointy-haired loser, but he's smart enough to know when he's being insulted right to his face. I'm looking to improve on that situation.
>>> Boss: <<<
You came to the right place.

2012-12-02 * 
Wally: <<<
I would like to be evaluated on my output, not the hours I work.
>>> Boss: <<<
Okay. That sounds reasonable.
>>> Wally: <<<
It does? Wow. And I'd also like to work at home where there are fewer distractions so I can be more productive.
>>> Boss: <<<
Okay. That makes sense.
>>> Wally: <<<
Really? I mean... great! I'd also like to work on long-term projects that have no near-term deliverables. Holy grail, holy grail, holy grail.
>>> Boss: <<<
Go back to your cubicle and don't leave until five o'clock.
>>> Wally: <<<
I was this close to retiring at full pay.
>>>
2012-12-01 * 
Boss: <<<
What would you say is your biggest fault?
>>> Interviewee: <<<
I like to sneak into people's cubicles and go through their drawers. I also tell the truth. It's not a good combination.
>>>
2012-11-30 * 
Boss: <<<
See if you can get consensus on your idea and get back to me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Or you could display some leadership and get back to me.
>>> Boss: <<<
I'm leading you right now.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Really? I thought it would feel different.
>>>
2012-11-29 * 
Boss: <<<
Dilbert, I need you to take care of this.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'd love to, but it isn't on the list of priorities you gave me an hour ago.
>>> Boss: <<<
Do what I tell you to do, not what I say you should do.
>>>
2012-11-28 * 
Boss: <<<
Your compensation will be based on achieving these goals.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Awesome. It's like written permission to ignore everything else you ask me to do.
>>> Boss: <<<
It's not like that at all.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Get back to me when you finish debating yourself.

We're going into the smartphone business. Smartphones are basically gadgets, and we already make gadgets, so how hard could it be?

That sounds lazy.

Asok: <<<
I completed the busywork you assigned to me and I'm still cheerful! I don't know how I do it. I really don't. I assume it's a form of insanity. Do you have more worthless assignments I could do before I seek professional help?

Yup.

First on the agenda, we're standardizing all screen savers to be our company logo. Second, our CEO is having a contest to see who can suggest the most useless corporate rule to eliminate.
>>> Wally: <<<
I nominate the nee screen-saver rule.
>>> Boss: <<<
You can't nominate that one. It's too new.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Why does that matter? Isn't it better to kill it before it gets implemented?
>>> Boss: <<<
It's too soon! It's just too soon!

Fine.

I nominate whatever is next on the agenda.

I send your question up the chain of command. I talked to the district manager who talked to his AVP who talked to his VP who talked to his SVP who talked to the CEO. The answer is that we need to shine the braille toad.

Do you see any problem with our system?
>>>
2012-11-22 *

I see myself as more of a leader than a manager.

That's what all jerks say.

Let's start with your attitude.

Persistence is the key to success. The other key to success is knowing when to quit.

You need to have more "gotcha" fees. That's how airlines make their money. For example, you could design your product to have a terrible battery life, then sell extra chargers for ten times your cost.

Do you have a minute to answer an engineering question? My wife is out of town visiting her sister. She asked me to put up the holiday lights while she was gone. I hired a homeless guy to do it and he fell off the roof. What's the easiest way to get rid of the body before my wife comes home?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Your question is disturbing, but I'm intrigued by the engineering part. Here's a design for a catapult you can build at home. And here's a satellite map showing the best flight path to a neighbor's pool. Did he die right away?
>>> Boss: <<<
No, just a broken leg.

Execution is a game of inches! You miss 100% of the shots you don't take! Innovation is everyone's full-time job! Be the dog, not the tail! Excellence is the only market that isn't crowded! Why don't any of you look inspired by my leadership?

The first question on the employee survey is... Do you feel you are valued and treated with respect and dignity?

Well, let me put it this way... you know how sometimes you step in something gross and then you have to wipe it off your shoe with a paper towel?
>>> Catbert: <<<
So... you feel like the paper towel?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No, the paper towel has a purpose.
>>> Catbert: <<<
So... you feel like the gross stuff on the shoe?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No, the gross stuff gets to leave. I feel like a shoe that has gross stuff on the bottom and a sweaty foot shoved all the way to the end of its sole.

We're thinking of moving from a cubicle workplace to an open floor plan.

Is that because you did some research that discovered that the open floor plan is the only thing worse than what we have now?

They figured out the pattern.
>>> Catbert: <<<
I told you we should randomize our evil!

I would be more productive with my own office. Studies show that cubicle workplaces lower intelligence.

Because I have an office.

I don't know how to say this delicately so I'll just say it. Looking at your homely, middle-class face makes my skin crawl. Never speak directly to me again. Sometimes I think they don't understand capitalism.

Boss: <<<
Take a look at this resume.
>>> Alice: <<<
Ha ha! This guy is a piece of work! Lie... lie... exaggeration... misspelling... bad format... worked on failed products. Ooh! He's also a champion salsa dancer. What a tool! Wait. Why aren't you joining in the traditional mocking of the applicant's resume?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm waiting to find out if he's the handsome fellow standing behind you.
>>> Alice: <<<
Scoot over. You're blocking my view of a handsome guy.

2012-10-13 * 
CEO: <<<
One of your engineers came to me with a suggestion.
>>> Boss: <<<
Gasp!
>>> CEO: <<<
The only reason I have middle managers is so this never happens.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Hey, buddy. What are we talking about?
>>> CEO: <<<
Gaaa!!! Worst case scenario!

Boss: <<<
Tina, you lack confidence.
>>> Tina: <<<
That's because you keep criticizing me! Nice leadership, you perspiring pile of pound cake! Was that better or worse? I can't tell. Performance Review

Dilbert: <<<
What do you mean by <<<
doesn't take criticism well?
>>> Boss: This is a perfect example. I say one little thing and you go all nuts on me. And the trap is set. Performance Review
2012-10-10 * 
Boss: <<<
Good news! Our biggest competitor just went out of business! There was so much anticipation for their next product that no one bought the current one and they ran out of money.
>>> Alice: <<<
Our strategy of predictable mediocrity paid off again.
>>> Boss: <<<
It's okay to call it genius.

2012-10-09 * 
Boss: <<<
I'm putting you on a project with Loud Howard, Topper and the new guy who loves the sound of his own voice.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is it because you hate me?
>>> Boss: <<<
Not at all. It's because I hate the other three guys.
>>>
2012-10-08 * 
Coworker: <<<
I just realized I love the sound of my own voice! Ha ha! Thanks to the unspoken rules of meetings, I can enjoy the sound of myself as long as I want! Blah, blah, blah!
>>> Loud Howard: <<<
What's all that noise!?
>>> Topper: <<<
That's nothing! No one knew the perfect storm was approaching
2012-10-07 * 
Wally: <<<
I like to have opinions. But not informed opinions. It takes so much work to get informed that it defeats the whole point of having an opinion in the first place.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What exactly do you think is the "point" of having an opinion?
>>> Wally: <<<
The point is that it feels good.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's totally nuts.
>>> Wally: <<<
Oh, is it? Unless you have hard data to back up that comment, it was nothing but an uninformed opinion. That felt good.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Gaaa!!! You're starting to make sense!
>>> Wally: <<<
Your whole life is a lie.

Imagine I invented a new technology for fracking. It involves grinding poor people into a slurry and pumping it into shale at high pressure. Do you see any problems with that?
>>> CEO: <<<
Not enough shale! CEO Morality Test

Boss: <<<
Did you ever think that getting that face tattoo might be a bad career move?
>>> Interviewee: <<<
No. Was there ever a time you thought overeating was a bad idea? Because people can see that.
>>> Boss: <<<
You don't interview well. Job interview

Boss: <<<
Here's some news I don't understand about libor rates. Here's some news I don't understand about the Higgs boson. Remind me why we have news.

I think it has something to do with patent law and the electoral college.

2012-10-03 * 
Boss: <<<
You did good work this week. I give you permission to leave early today.

It's five minutes before my normal quitting time.

Your work was good, not great. Get over yourself.

Interviewee: <<<
Google offered me a million dollars a year. What's your offer?
>>> Boss: <<<
Work for us and you can change the world!
>>> Interviewee: <<<
Change it how?
>>> Boss: <<<
By lowering the average pay of engineers. Hiring engineers
2012-10-01 * 
Boss: <<<
The big companies are hiring all of the good engineering students as soon as they graduate. We need to start earlier. I want you to skulk around school yards and try to form relationships with kids who are nerdy loners. Offer them candy. Kids love candy.

I don't see how this plan could go wrong.

Boss: <<<
Brian tells me you're not being helpful.
>>> Asok: <<<
Gaaa!!! You have been painted by the brush of unhelpfulness. There is no way to remove the stigma of this accusation.
>>> Wally: <<<
Watch and learn. Brian has... um... issues.
>>> Boss: <<<
Issues? What issues? Mental? Emotional? Substance abuse?
>>> Wally: <<<
I've said too much. It's not my place.
>>> Boss: <<<
He's a monster!
>>> Asok: <<<
You make it look easy!
>>>
2012-09-29 * 
CEO: <<<
My new executive team got together and figured out the source of all of our problems.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is the problem that the executive team keeps changing, and that means the company strategy keeps changing?
>>> Wally: <<<
Is the problem that all of our meetings turn awkward?

2012-09-28 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I assume we pay you based on how much you increase our social media hits.
>>> Consultant: <<<
No. My fee is whatever I think you're dumb enough to pay for ambiguous outcomes.

Either hope just left my body or the popcorn is getting chatty. Social media expert

Consultant: <<<
If you give me lots of money, I will do various vague things to increase your web traffic.

Wow! I would have been happy with just various things, but that vague stuff sounds great too!

We don't do it that way.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's not a reason.

Nothing you say means anything!

That's how we've always done it.

2012-09-25 * 
Boss: <<<
Experts say that doing mindless and repetitive tasks is a good way to spur creativity. That means you must be the most creative person in the office. Did you come up with any ideas?
>>> Carol: <<<
Yup. So far, I've come up with over seven hundred ways to dispose of your body.
>>>
2012-09-24 * 
CEO: <<<
Uh-oh. I'm lost and I've wandered into the grimy habitat of an underling. I feel the cold desperation of your drab and meaningless life. I need to roll in money to get the smell off me. Where's the nearest pile?
>>>
2012-09-23 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I need a decision of this by end of business today.
>>> Boss: <<<
Which option do you recommend?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Nice try, but I'm not falling for it. You're trying to set me up to take the blame later. I want to hear you make a decision, and I'm going to record it on my phone so you don't later deny it. Talk, you evil monster! Talk! All I know for sure is that the other approach wasn't going to work either.

2012-09-22 * 
Coworker: <<<
It was a great book. I'll loan you the paperback.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Thanks. I love it when other people decide how I'll spend my free time.

I can't tell when you're kidding.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Paperbacks are awesome. I'm a big fan of clutter.

Carl choked the pooch on the platform decision. I need you to throw him under the bus.

He sounds like a very bad person. I will take care of that right away. I just found a website that lists regional idioms. I've done some bad, bad things.

2012-09-20 * 
Studies show that attitudes are socially contagious. I'm getting a lazy vibe from this idiot. It's totally killing my motivation. Oh, great. Now I'm unmotivated and angry, too.

2012-09-19 *

Persistence is the key to success. The other key is knowing when to quit.

The right time for you was one sentence sooner.

2012-09-18 * 
Interviewee: <<<
But enough about me. How can I help you achieve your career goals?
>>> Boss: <<<
You could work 80 hours a week for below-market compensation.
>>> Interviewee: <<<
I did not see that coming.

Good. I need employees who can't see it coming. You're hired. Job interview
2012-09-17 * 
Boss: <<<
I've been so busy lately that I haven't had time to manage you. It must have been a nightmare for all of you to be without my leadership for so long.

This might be a good tome to lead us to the next topic on the agenda.

2012-09-16 * 
Coworker: <<<
Emergency! I can't find my phone and I'm late for a customer meeting.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Maybe it's with your company I.D. badge that you had to drive all the way home for this morning.
>>> Alice: <<<
It might be with your keys that you lost after lunch.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Maybe it's under that critical folder that you couldn't find before your last meeting.
>>> Alice: <<<
Maybe it's wherever you created your last self-generated crisis.
>>> Coworker: <<<
I just remembered I put my phone in my purse because the battery is dead. Has anyone seen a small, brown purse?

2012-09-15 * 
Dogbert: <<<
I've decided to become a money manager for dumb celebrities. Celebrities don't pay close attention to where their money is invested, or who is stealing it.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So you plan to help them protect their money?

That would be one way to play it.

2012-09-14 * 
CEO: <<<
Did you know that poor people invented ethics to control rich people? Nice try, poor people! It's not working! If they haven't killed me by now, a little trash talk won't make any difference.

2012-09-13 * 
CEO: <<<
I did some insider trading and totally got away with it. It felt great! It was a victimless crime so I feel no guilt whatsoever.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Do you know what victimless means?
>>> CEO: <<<
Yes. It's like the time I strangled my gardener for overwatering the rose bushes.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I see the problem.
>>>
2012-09-12 * 
Coworker: <<<
I need to give you some push-back on these due dates.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No problem. Should I tell the others you're lazy, or incompetent, or in over your head?
>>> Coworker: <<<
How about just <<<
busy?
>>> Dilbert: Okay. I will insist that people ignore the root cause.

Asok: <<<
Have you selected a remora for your visit to the trade show?
>>> Coworker: <<<
What's a remora?
>>> Asok: <<<
A remora is a fish that suctions to the back of a larger marine animal.

He's not comfortable in crowds, but he's freakishly persuasive.

2012-09-10 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Do you mind if i check something on my phone?
>>> Woman: <<<
Why would I mind the humiliation and disrespect of being with a man who prefers the company of his phone?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's the sort of attitude that makes you finish second to my phone.

2012-09-09 * 
Boss: <<<
Take a company car and meet a customer at our data center on Montgomery and Pine.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I can't drive to an unfamiliar place with Alice. She'll spend the entire trip arguing with the GPS navigation system.
>>> Boss: <<<
No one does that.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Allow me to demonstrate. My phone says we should take this route.
>>> Alice: <<<
What?! Is it crazy? We are not taking 880! Change your mind! Change your mind! Change your mind!

It gets worse.

If you listen to this liar, I will end you.

This design would be inefficient.

Is it awkward being in the same meeting as a cooler version of yourself? Scoot back so I can get a clear view. This guy really makes my engine purr. A little more.

2012-09-06 * 
Boss: <<<
Dilbert, this is Lars. He's a better version of you. This is what you would look like if you were stylish and cool and fun to be with.

Can it do math?
>>> Man: <<<
That will matter on the same day that all the ugly people die.

2012-09-05 * 
Woman: <<<
So, what do you do for a living?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm working on a framework to allow construction of large-scale analytical queries on unstructured data.
>>> Woman: <<<
I'm a little turned on by that.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Settle down. It's just a framework.
>>>
2012-09-04 * 
Boss: <<<
I don't have a budget for the network monitoring software you need, so you'll have to write it yourself.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Good plan. I'll check back with you when I'm done doing that. What's your calendar look like in the year 2040?
>>> Boss: <<<
Sort of a grid with square boxes.

2012-09-03 * 
Mordac: <<<
I, Mordac, the preventer of information services, reject your business case because you used the old template. Ha ha ha! I feed on your anger and frustration! And now I will eat like a king!

Good luck with that. I've been dead on the inside since the teamwork seminar.

Sheesh. I'm living on goldfish crackers.

2012-09-02 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I heard a rumor that Apple's next phone will have a 20-megapixel camera.
>>> Topper: <<<
That's nothing! I heard you'll be able to hold the phone to your head and take a picture of your thoughts. And even that's nothing. Their next phone will be a time machine!
>>> Future Topper: <<<
Here I am from the future! I'm the most handsome man in the universe!

He makes a good case for buying an Android phone.

Boss: <<<
Can you explain why you're doing such a bad job on your new assignment?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Yes I can: some idiot did a poor job matching my skills to my assignment.
>>> Boss: <<<
Let's try it again, but this time say something bad about yourself.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm too honest?
>>>
2012-08-31 * 
Boss: <<<
Alice, this is my daughter. Her career plan is to become a trophy wife for a blind guy.
>>> Girl: <<<
And by that he means he's not happy that I'm majoring in visual and performing arts.
>>> Alice: <<<
I'm having trouble choosing sides on this one.
>>>
2012-08-30 * 
Boss: <<<
You keep spending time on low-priority tasks.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's because I'm a rational being. I only work on tasks that are likely to give me some sort of reward.
>>> Boss: <<<
I don't know how to deal with that.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Have you tried managing?
>>>
2012-08-29 * 
Boss: <<<
From now on, I'm going to rely on my intuition instead of market research.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
If guessing can bring your success rate up to 50% for binary choices, I'm all for it. Hey, look! I found a tiny manager made of copper in my pocket!

2012-08-28 * 
Ratbert: <<<
Let's talk like idiots.
>>> Bob: <<<
Ha ha! You go first!

Slap lipstick on the pig, put a stake in the ground, and view it from 30,000 feet.
>>> Bob: <<<
That deliverable is actionable.

Wait... why do I suddenly feel like hiring you?

And why do I feel underpaid?

2012-08-27 * 
Coworker: <<<
Can I get your input by Friday?
>>> Wally: <<<
Absolutely, unless something comes up.
>>> Coworker: <<<
How often does something come up?
>>> Wally: <<<
More than you'd think.
>>> Coworker: <<<
What exactly are we talking about?
>>> Wally: <<<
I'd love to chat, but something just came up.
>>>
2012-08-26 * 
Boss: <<<
I can't give you the raise you deserve because it would make your pay higher than mine.
>>> Alice: <<<
I don't see how that's a problem.
>>> Boss: <<<
Let me explain it to you this way, Alice. If you make more money than I do your compensation would be greater than mine.
>>> Alice: <<<
That's not a reason, you ignorant baboon!
>>> Boss: <<<
Okay, how about... I must be smarter than you because my income is higher.
>>> Alice: <<<
Gaaa!!!
>>> Boss: <<<
When I don't have reasons for things, is that called intuition or just common sense?

Dogbert: <<<
Your fake 50% sale prices make dumb customers feel like smart shoppers.
>>> CEO: <<<
Why am I paying you $400 an hour to tell me what I already know?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Usually I charge $800 and hour.
>>> CEO: <<<
Yes! I'm a freakin' genius. Dogbert consults
2012-08-24 * 
CEO: <<<
We're going to stop pretending our products are always on sale and instead offer low prices all the time. The average person is smart enough to know that our so-called sales prices are our normal prices anyway.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Have you ever talked to an average person?
>>> Boss: <<<
Tell me again why we're raising all of our prices?
>>>
2012-08-23 * 
Mordac: <<<
Elbonian hackers stole a million usernames and passwords from our servers. So I send an army of data werewolves to track down the perpetrators and eat their entrails.

How did you find an army of data werewolves?
>>> Mordac: <<<

2012-08-22 * 
Boss: <<<
And we're going to bet the company on our new software product.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
While you were talking, Google created that product, gave it away for free, and killed it for lack of interest.
>>> Wally: <<<
Is it too soon to take back my fake buy-in?
>>>
2012-08-21 * 
Boss: <<<
A good manager tailors his leadership style to fit each employee. In your case, I think the best approach involves poling you with a sharpened pool cue. To be perfectly honest, a big part of leadership is guessing.

How do you feel when I give you positive feedback?
>>> Alice: <<<
Underpaid.

How do you feel when I give you negative feedback?

Underappreciated.
>>> Boss: <<<
Then what motivates you?

The government makes rectangular pieces of paper.

2012-08-19 * 
Dogbert: <<<
You need to act more like an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs make decisions that will end in failure 90% of the time. They motivate people through bullying, lying, manipulation and verbal abuse. Entrepreneurs make their employees work so many hours that their personal lives and their bodies fall apart.
>>> Boss: <<<
I've been doing all that stuff for years.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Has it worked?
>>> Boss: <<<
No.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Well, in that case, you're not an entrepreneur. You're just a huge jerk.
>>> Boss: <<<
Is that why no one is writing my biography?
>>>
2012-08-18 * 
Employee: <<<
Just give it to me straight. Skip all of your jargon and euphemisms. Don't tell me you're rebalancing or offboarding or streamlining. Just talk to me the way you'd talk to your spouse.

Consider yourself excreted.

Well, now I see why you use euphemisms.

No more than $85.

2012-08-16 * 
CEO: <<<
Google has offered to buy our company for $100 million just to get our engineers. I agreed to the deal because I'm a modern day slave trader who believes engineers are property and the rest of you have no economic value. Who wrote my speech?

Someone with no economic value.

2012-08-15 * 
CEO: <<<
Google offered to buy our company for $100 million just to get our engineers.

Huh. I wonder if I can convince the other engineers to jump ship today and share $100 million amongst us.

What did he just say?

Nothing. Just thinking out loud.

How would you diagnose a buffer overflow problem?

I'd put the circuit board in a bucket of water and look for air bubbles.

That sounds right.

You're supposed to be cold calling sales prospects.

Wally: <<<
Here's a list of the twelve elements of great managing. If you do everything on that list, it will make me feel what experts call <<<
engaged.
>>> If you fail to do your job properly, I will feel all disengaged and do poor work. This would be a convenient time to give me some praise and recognition. You might also want to encourage my development and tell me my job is important. Remember to care about me as a person and tell me my opinions count. If you do all of that, plus seven more things on the list, you might get some productivity out of me.
>>> Boss: <<<
Leave my office and drop dead.
>>> Wally: <<<
Will that help me learn and grow?

Asok: <<<
I know it feels unimportant to be an intern to another intern, but if I ever get into a serious accident then...

I would step into your job?

I was going to say your organs will be harvested to save me, but now you've made it awkward.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Sorry!

2012-08-10 * 
Tina: <<<
Are you the new upaid intern?
>>> Coworker: <<<
No, but that's what I aspire to be. I'm merely an intern to another intern. And I pay a resort fee just to use the restroom.

At least you get valuable work experience.

Until he zips the eyeholes on the leather hood I wear in meetings.

I worked every night for a month to come up with a detailed quote for one of our potential customers. Then those weasels used our quote to get a better price from their regular vendor!

Did you really do all of that work?
>>> Wally: <<<
No, but it nets out the same.
>>>
2012-08-08 *

This is my new intern. I haven't bothered to name him yet. I've been treated poorly as an intern, and I'm anxious to perpetuate the cycle of abuse.

I have a name!

He's feisty. I like that.
>>>
2012-08-07 * 
Boss: <<<
We don't have any openings for regular interns, but I can offer you a job as an intern to our intern. We won't pay you, of course, but you might acquire an imperceptible amount of semi-relevant job experience. And sometimes we'll slap you for no reason.
>>> Applicant: <<<
Stupid economy! I'll take it.

2012-08-06 * 
Customer: <<<
I'd like to do business with your company, but I'm concerned that the only beverage you can afford to offer me is water from the restroom sink... and I need to bring my own cup.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I also offered to fill the sink and let you lap it out.
>>> Customer: <<<
And now I'm thirsty!
>>>
2012-08-05 * 
Boss: <<<
Wally, I'm sending you to a conference for the world's top engineers. With any luck, one of our competitors will try to poach you. That will save me the trouble of firing you. You'll be going with five other people I want to get rid of. I took the liberty of updating your resume. If this goes as planned, you'll destroy one of our competitors from within. Like a hideous disease. Make me proud!
>>> Wally: <<<
It was the first time I ever felt useful. I didn't like it.
>>>
2012-08-04 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Before we start, can I offer you a cup of water from our restroom sink? We can't afford bottled water.
>>> Customer: <<<
Okay, sure. I'll have a cup of sink water.

That brings us to the awkward part: did you happen to bring a cup?

Slash the R&D budget, fire 9,000 employees, and buy a sexy start-up company that we can run into the ground.

Yes. They thought you were being ironic.

Tina, our database analyst quit, so I need you to take over that job.

I completed the wireframe and passed it off to our coders.

That's great. Did you incorporate all of my specs?

I didn't see any specs from you. Maybe my spam filter ate your email.

No problem. I'll resend them and you can start from scratch.

Yes, I certainly could do that. Or I could ignore your input, enjoy my deep feeling of accomplishment and hope for the best.

Give me ten minutes to transform it into an emergency. Brad is being unhelpful. I need you to talk to his boss.

Sure. Brad refuses to help Alice. Brad's Boss: Help her do what?

Boss: <<<
Let's brainstorm new product ideas. Remember, the most important rule of brainstorming is no criticizing.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'll go first. Research shows that brainstorming is less effective than people working by themselves and later comparing ideas. My idea is to use stem cell technology to design bosses who aren't ignoramuses. Remember, you're not supposed to criticize ideas. But if you decide to do it anyway, it sort of proves my point. I understand whey brainstorming has a bad reputation, but it doesn't stop me from enjoying it.

Shouldn't you cut their budget, not ours?

Their budget isn't big enough to make a difference to the bottom line.

When will it be safe?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Right after you die.
>>>
2012-05-13 * 
Dilbert: <<<
... and that's my suggestion for our next product.
>>> Alice: <<<
How do we know that ten other companies aren't working on the same idea.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Well, that's always a possibility.
>>> Wally: <<<
There are seven billion people on Earth. I'll bet a million of them had this idea.
>>> Asok: <<<
It's irrational to think that any new product is likely to be a hit. On the other hand, we only get paid if we pretend to be optimistic about new products.
>>> Wally: <<<
All in favor of faking our optimism, raise your hands.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
All I could get was a fake buy-in.
>>> Boss: <<<
That's the only kind there is.
>>>
2012-05-12 * 
Finance Troll: Our sales have dropped to zero in retail stores that have self-checkout. Apparently the people who are dumb enough to want our product are too dumb to know how to use the self-checkout. On a positive note, we have the most shoplifted product of the year.
>>> Boss: <<<
Yes!
>>>
2012-05-11 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Customers are threatening to boycott us if we continue to advertise on Dogbert's radio show. Dogbert insulted every man, woman, child and organic substance in the known universe. He called the moon something that rhymes with totem.
>>> Boss: <<<
Modem?
>>>
2012-05-10 * 
Wally: <<<
I finished the space elevator prototype.
>>> Boss: <<<
So soon? I thought it would take years?
>>> Wally: <<<
It's just a prototype. Do you want to try it.
>>> Boss: <<<
Sure.
>>>
2012-05-09 * 
Coworker: <<<
And my revenue forecast says...
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Did you make any assumptions?
>>> Coworker: <<<
I made a lot of them.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Then we don't believe your forecast.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Can I tell you about it anyway?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Do whatever makes you feel less absurd.
>>>
2012-05-08 * 
Alice: <<<
What's up with the hobo outfit?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I have a client meeting. You should always dress one level up from the client. He dresses casually to flaunt his success, so I'm dressing even more casually.
>>> Alice: <<<
Wow. You actually don't know which direction is up.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
This stain is fudge.
>>>
2012-05-07 * 
Dilbert: <<<
We interviewed hundreds of users and turned all of their suggestions into features. As it turns out, every user we talked to was an idiot, and their dumb suggestions ruined our product. In hindsight, we probably should have talked to people who work outside this building.
>>>
2012-05-06 * 
Boss: <<<
How did we do at the trade show?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
We had a huge crowd around our booth the entire time. But it was just the spillover from the popular booth next to us. The only person who asked for our brochure used it to kill a spider. Some guy tried to steal our extra chair and then Alice beat him senseless with our logo sign. A video of the incident is already on YouTube. It cost us $200,000 to be an exhibitor and we gained zero new customers. So it was just like the last eleven years.
>>> Boss: <<<
I feel good about next year!
>>>
2012-05-05 * 
Co-worker 1: So, Dilbert, what else are you working on lately?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'd rather not say because you have a habit of misinterpreting everything you hear and then bad-mouthing it later. Co-worker 1: He basically said he's too paranoid to talk to people. Co-worker 2: He sounds crazy.
>>>
2012-05-04 * 
Wally: <<<
I invented a taser that looks exactly like a cellphone.
>>> Boss: <<<
Gaaa-a-a-a-a-a-a.
>>> Wally: <<<
I left it on our boss's desk, but it sounds like he's done with it.
>>>
2012-05-03 * 
Customer: <<<
Your free app is stealing my personal information. I'd like to lodge a complaint.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Buy our monthly subscription package or I'll send your browser history to your contacts.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How's your app going?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
It practically sells itself.
>>>
2012-05-02 * 
Monkey: <<<
I thought being a service animal would be a noble calling. But I worry that our relationship has drifted into something less dignified.
>>> Wally: <<<
That's what keeps my coffee warm.
>>> Monkey: <<<
I am so angry right now.
>>>
2012-05-01 * 
Tina: <<<
Those must be the Google glasses that give you information about your environment.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Yes, and I see seventeen reasons to not be your friend. I'll sweep your dumb tweets off to the side.
>>> Tina: <<<
This is unsettling.
>>>
2012-04-30 * 
Boss: <<<
I read a book about how to be a great leader, and realized I don't do any of those things. I'm surprised a book with so many errors could get published. It must have been written by a disgruntled underling.
>>> Wally: <<<
Do those exist?
>>>
2012-04-29 * 
Dilbert: <<<
People always try to take advantage of me.
>>> Therapist: <<<
I know what you mean. I lost five pounds and my husband didn't notice! I came home last night and he hadn't even cleaned the garage like he promised. I had to park on the street!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is it my imagination, or have you found a clever way to make people pay to listen to you complain? Therapist; Tell me more about how you think I'm clever.
>>>
2012-04-28 * 
Monkey: <<<
I'm Wally's service monkey. I'll be fielding any questions directed at Wally.
>>> Boss: <<<
With all due respect, a business meeting is no place for a monkey.
>>> Monkey: <<<
With all due respect, that was a stronger argument before I saw your PowerPoint slides.
>>>
2012-04-27 * 
Wally: <<<
Tell me why I should hire you as my service monkey, Carl.
>>> Monkey: <<<
I worked as a Starbucks barista for eight years, and my head has been surgically flattened to stabilize your coffee cup.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Impressive.
>>> Wally: <<<
This is nothing. You should see how well he interviews.
>>>
2012-04-26 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Hey, Alice, do you have...
>>> Dog: <<<
She can't hear you. She's walking and texting. That's it... Easy does it. I'll guide you around this obstacle.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What did I just see?
>>> Wally: <<<
I'm saving up for a service monkey.
>>>
2012-04-25 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Let's hear what Barry learned from our vendors and go from there.
>>> Coworker: <<<
I didn't have time to call anyone, but I can speculate about what might have happened if I had.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm curious to see how this will work out for you.
>>> Coworker: <<<
None of these vendors would have called me back.
>>>
2012-04-24 * 
CEO: <<<
Our new brand will be called "Herthlokel."
>>> Tina: <<<
Did you come up with that when you were getting dental work? I probably should have kept that thought bottled up inside me.
>>>
2012-04-23 * 
Coworker: <<<
Please tell me our apps don't steal contact information from our users' address books.
>>> Boss: <<<
We upload the data but we don't store it.
>>> Coworker: <<<
That's like saying I can date your wife if I put a bag over her head.
>>> Boss: <<<
That could work.
>>> Coworker: <<<
I don't think I'm getting through to you.
>>>
2012-04-22 * 
Boss: <<<
Any comments on the project plan?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
When you consider all of the tasks together, they form a rational plan. But our individual tasks are so far removed from the big picture that they are stripped of meaning. You've managed to remove all sense of purpose from my life. On an intellectual level, I understand the benefits of breaking tasks into small chunks. But you've left me emotionally gutted. As I read your plan, I'm losing my will to live.
>>> Boss: <<<
Can't you find meaning in your personal life?
>>> Tina: <<<
He's an engineer.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Now you're just being a jerk.
>>>
2012-04-21 * 
Boss: <<<
I need you to bury some top secret proprietary documents in the woods for me.
>>> Man: <<<
Mmm mmph.
>>> Boss: <<<
Come back in ten minutes.
>>>
2012-04-20 * 
Boss: <<<
Can you hack into our competitor's network and make it look as if the Elbonians did it?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No.
>>> Boss: <<<
Can you bribe a blogger to write good things about our company?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No.
>>> Boss: <<<
Now that I've worn down your limited capacity for self-control, I need you to bury something in the woods, no questions asked.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Fine.
>>>
2012-04-19 * 
Tina: <<<
I just noticed you head is huge.
>>> Alice: <<<
I never noticed it before, but now all I see is a parade float made out of pasty skin.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Communication is overrated.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I'm feeling that right now.
>>>
2012-04-18 * 
Coworker: <<<
I made some edits to your document.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
These edits are so bad that my only choices are to send it out and make a fool of myself or insult your alleged intelligence.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Please let it be the first choice.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I hope you didn't pick the wrong religion too.
>>>
2012-04-17 * 
Boss: <<<
How's your quantum computer prototype coming along?
>>> Wally: <<<
Great! The project exists in a simultaneous state of being both totally successful and not even started.
>>> Boss: <<<
Can I observe it?
>>> Wally: <<<
That's a tricky question.
>>>
2012-04-16 * 
Boss: <<<
The stock market is up today. I wonder if this is a good time to get in.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
If you wait until it goes up even further, then you'll know it's a good investment.
>>> Wally: <<<
Are you still bitter about your last raise?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Not as much as I was a minute ago.
>>>
2012-04-15 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I did a study of our past business plans and found something. There's no correlation between our predicted and actual outcomes. That might be a problem for you. Your enormous CEO compensation is based on the myth that you have some control over our profitability.
>>> CEO: <<<
Ha!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Ha!
>>> CEO: <<<
Is it just me or is this awkward?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No, I'm feeling it too.
>>>
2012-04-14 * 
Boss: <<<
I like to promote from within. The only downside is that picking from a smaller pool of candidates will make us less capable than our competitors and lead the company to ruination. Do you want that?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I see what you're doing.
>>>
2012-04-13 * 
Boss: <<<
This is Brendan and Brandon. They'll be helping us with our branding.
>>> Alice: <<<
I'm sorry, but I can't get past the ridiculousness of it all. I'm out.
>>> Boss: <<<
Do you get this a lot? Brendan and Brandon: It's worse when we bring Brad.
>>>
2012-04-12 * 
Boss: <<<
We're consolidating our marketing into a shared services model.
>>> Asok: <<<
Why?
>>> Boss: <<<
Change creates the illusion that we have a strategy while giving our CEO an excuse to fire a VP who beat him at golf. And blah, blah, something about money.
>>> Asok: <<<
Must... not... cry... on the outside.
>>>
2012-04-11 * 
Boss: <<<
I hired a management consultant to teach us something he calls backwards causation.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I studied the most successful companies. If you imitate them, you'll feel as if you have a strategy.
>>> Number one: <<<

Profits, here we come.

Boss: <<<
I want you to work from home for two days per week to reduce our carbon footprint.
>>> Employee: <<<
Nooooo! My wife and three small children are in that house. They're always mean to me.
>>> Boss: <<<
How bad could it be?
>>> Employee: <<<
Let me put it this way: I'm sitting in an egg carton and talking to a moron, and this is better.

2012-04-08 * 
Tina: <<<
Wally, do you want to go to lunch?
>>> Wally: <<<
No, thanks. I'm a digisexual now.
>>> Tina: <<<
What: Wally: I'm no longer attracted to people. I only like technology. People creep me out. You're basically a delivery system for viruses, germs, and unreasonable favor requests. I'm willing to take a picture of you, but that's as far as I'll go.
>>> Tina: <<<
This is the most disturbing conversation I've ever had.
>>> Wally: <<<
Thank goodness for Photoshop.
>>>
2012-04-07 * 
Wally: <<<
IF you agree to give me no work, I will agree to not sue you with some sort of bogus employee claim. My existence will make your empire seem larger, and stockholders will get stuck with the bill for my paycheck.
>>> Boss: <<<
Why does that seem like a fair plan?
>>> Wally: <<<
We live in an awful world.
>>>
2012-04-06 * 
Boss: <<<
Studies say your happiness depends on how well your life compares to others. So instead of giving you a raise, I'm going to show you pictures of people who were attacked by bears. Do you feel better now?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Dang you to heck, this is working!
>>>
2012-04-05 * 
Dogbert: <<<
Want some free software?
>>> Boss: <<<
What's it do?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
All it does is beg you for upgrades. And if you upgrade, then it begs you to upgrade again and so on. And it makes all of you other software run slow.
>>> Boss: <<<
And it's free?
>>>
2012-04-04 * 
Coworker: <<<
I'm sorry I'm a few minutes late for our 10:50 meeting.
>>> Wally: <<<
We'll have to reschedule because I have another meeting at eleven.
>>> Tina: <<<
Reschedule? I'm only ten minutes late!
>>> Wally: <<<
Tell that to my 11:10.
>>>
2012-04-03 *

Hey, you must be the cash cow I keep hearing about. You must be making cash right now!
>>> Cash Cow: <<<
It doesn't work every time.
>>>
2012-04-02 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Every time I have an idea for a new app, I discover that ten people already created something just like it. As the population of the world increases, the potential value of every idea I have approaches zero.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
So, it's the entire world's fault that you have unoriginal ideas?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Why does your agreeing sound like mocking?
>>>
2012-04-01 * 
Dogbert: <<<
You need to imbue your staff with a sense of urgency.
>>> Boss: <<<
Gaaa!!! Our technology platforms are obsolete!
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Try it again with less panic.
>>> Boss: <<<
We're doomed, and yet, I am not the least bit worried.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
That one had a creepy vibe. A sense of urgency is halfway between being too frightened to act and too dumb to know what to do.
>>> Boss: <<<
Gaaa!!! Duh!!!
>>> Dogbert: <<<
You didn't quite thread the needle.
>>> Boss: <<<
Here comes leadership!
>>>
2012-03-31 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I spent four months creating this app, mom. I think I can sell a million of them for $3.99.
>>> Mom: <<<
I saw seven apps just like this in the app store and five of them were free.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Thanks for the feedback, dream-killer.
>>> Mom: <<<
Have you ever thought of just using your first name, like Madonna?
>>>
2012-03-30 * 
Carol: <<<
I've been reading our bereavement policy and I found a problem. I get three days off if my husband eats nothing but unhealthy food and dies young. And I'm the one who does our grocery shopping.
>>> Boss: <<<
Sounds like a conflict of interest.
>>> Carol: <<<
I'm glad I'm not the only one who sees it.
>>>
2012-03-29 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Your page layout is ugly.
>>> Tina: <<<
Whose fault is that? I work in an ugly cubicle surrounded by ugly people. You trample on my sense of aesthetics and expect me to be unaffected?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So... it's my fault?
>>> Tina: <<<
You, your parents, your barber, and whoever dresses you.
>>>
2012-03-28 * 
Wally: <<<
Give me a raise or else I'll get married and have children. My new family would increase your benefit expenses and distract me from my laser-like focus on work.
>>> Boss: <<<
I will gladly pay extra to prevent you from procreating.
>>> Wally: <<<
Word it any way you like.
>>>
2012-03-27 * 
Wally: <<<
I'm escaping the mental prison of this job by creating apps in my mind and fantasizing about running a start-up. Gaaa!!! The start-up is too much work! The stress is killing me! Take me back to my prison! I'm back. Did I say anything embarrassing?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It's all relative.
>>>
2012-03-26 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Our competitor just bought ten million copies of our software.
>>> Boss: <<<
Huh?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
They plan to give it away for free to entice people to buy their own product that has more features. We'll be part of their freemium strategy.
>>> Boss: <<<
That's just showing off.
>>>
2012-03-25 * 
Dilbert: <<<
We need to upgrade some of our servers.
>>> Coworker: <<<
That's dumb. We upgraded two of them last week.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Right now we need to upgrade the rest of them.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Then why did you say we have to upgrade all of them?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Well, I didn't. But I think we all agree on what needs to be done.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Not if you insist on upgrading the servers we already upgraded last week.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Gaaaa!!! Kill me with a comet!!!
>>> Coworker: <<<
Does he ever say anything that makes sense?
>>> Wally: <<<
There's no way to be sure.
>>>
2012-03-24 * 
Dilbert: <<<
My old nemesis retired, so I asked Randy to take over that function because he's ineffective at everything he does.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Huh?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
The physics of work required that each employee be matched with an anti-employee called a nemesis.
>>> Coworker: <<<
I don't know who my nemesis is.
>>> Wally: <<<
Uh-oh. You got a hider. They're the worst.
>>>
2012-03-23 * 
Dilbert: <<<
My old nemesis retired. Would you like to be my new nemesis?
>>> Coworker: <<<
Why me?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You're notoriously ineffective. That's the best kind of nemesis to have. [thinks to himself] That should prime the pump.
>>> Coworker: <<<
I will thwart you a new one!
>>>
2012-03-22 * 
Dilbert: <<<
According to my research on the internet, Plan B will work best.
>>> Boss: <<<
I'm rolling my eyes because you believe everything you read on the internet.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I should take a picture in case someone ever asks me if ignorance has a tell.
>>>
2012-03-21 * 
Boss: <<<
I can't sign off on this technology plan because I don't understand it.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
To be fair, you wouldn't understand any technology plan, including the <<<
do nothing" scenario. Is this one of those cases where context isn't helpful?
>>>
2012-03-20 * 
Dilbert: <<<
My phone is like a time machine. I can fast-forward through the boring parts of life by playing with it.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Hand it over. Time flies when I'm not having fun.
>>>
2012-03-19 * 
Wally: <<<
Do you feel any need to make conversation?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Nope. But I don't mind standing in your general vicinity to counter the common perception of you as a sociopathic loner.
>>> Wally: <<<
You totally get me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's what acquaintances are for.
>>>
2012-03-18 * 
Woman: <<<
Okay, what's going on here?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm creative. Studies show that women prefer creative men for short-term relationships.
>>> Woman: <<<
That plant is random, not creative.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Creativity is random. If creativity were anything but random, someone would have figured out the algorithm by now. I notice that your pupils are dilating. That's a sign of attraction. My plan is working. Free will is an illusion. Humans are nothing but moist robots. Just relax and let it happen.
>>> Woman: <<<
This is weird. I'm actually attracted to you now.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Thanks, but I'm going to shop around.
>>> Woman: <<<
My world no longer makes sense!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Walk it off.
>>>
2012-03-17 * 
Boss: <<<
Our company opposes passage of the new internet law because it would be bad for our business. But that sounds selfish, so we'll issue a press release saying the new law would impinge freedom of speech.

So... we're selfish liars?
>>> Boss: <<<
You can't get more free than that!

CEO: <<<
Our plunging productivity is all because of an eight-year-old boy named Traylor. Traylor doesn't wash his hands, he brings home every virus and germ from school, and gives it to his mom, who brings it to work with her.

Maybe you should see a doctor.
>>> Carol: <<<
It's just allergies!

2012-03-15 * 
Carol: <<<
I've got a wicked case of piranha flu.

Ahchooo!!! I should probably tell people I just have bad allergies.
>>>
2012-03-14 * 
CEO: <<<
I'm canceling all of our new product development and using the capital for a stock buy-back.

This is a dream come true because I always wanted to be like you.

In what way are you...

Yay! I'm worthless!

Scientists say there might be billions of planets like Earth. And we might be one of many universes.

This guy! Meanwhile, on XPKQ-75
2012-03-12 * 
Co-worker: Why are all the engineers in this meeting squirming when I talk? Did your boss order you to act like team players during this meeting and later thwart me by inaction? Answer me!
>>>
2012-03-11 * 
Boss: <<<
Did you get the email I texted to you? Co-worker: What? That doesn't even make sense. What the heck is wrong with you?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Let it go. He slips in and out of understanding basic technology.
>>> Boss: <<<
Do we have enough room in the cloud for Skype? Because if we don't, we can store some files on the wi-fi.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I got this. We have plenty of space because we upgraded to a cumulonimbus cloud.
>>> Boss: <<<
Very good. Moving on.
>>>
2012-03-10 * 
Woman: <<<
I like men who are confident in any situation.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Within that subset of men, do you prefer the phonies or the ones who are too dumb to know when they shouldn't be confident?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
What went wrong this time?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I showed interest in her opinion.
>>>
2012-03-09 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I've got two good prospects on this dating site. One is addicted to Facebook and the other is addicted to prescription pain meds.

Sort of a tie.

But only one of them is likely to make eye contact.

Wally, I want you to manage our Elbonian contract programmers. You'll need to work at night because of the time difference.

Yes, and it's totally legal.
>>> Wally: <<<
Well played.

Talk to Allen about this.

I'll need an exit strategy. He's a serial talker. I'll be trapped for hours while he strings together infinite, unrelated stories.

Nope. Do you mind if I pretend to be listening while I think about other things?

Cool.

I'm glad I don't have your job.

You just did.

Rogue nations are building nuclear weapons. The polar ice caps are melting. Unemployment is high. Entire nations are on the brink of default. You aren't saving enough for retirement.

I'm designing a suite of internet collaboration tools. It's part of my long-term goal to eliminate all forms of direct human contact. Co-worker: That's messed up.

You're exactly what I'm trying to avoid.

I should drink wine at lunch more often. I'm in the mood to tweet. I hope the down-trodden have a sense of humor. Bad Idea. Worse Idea. Worst Idea.

Dilbert: <<<
My PowerPoint slides have a little something for everyone. For my intelligent viewers, I have data, and for the morons, I have manipulative anecdotes. Which reminds me-- did you hear about the boss who died because he didn't praise his employee?

Wally: <<<
This is Sven, our biggest customer from Elbonia. Whoa! No handshake. That's an insult. The first time you meed an Elbonian you kiss his mitten.
>>> Elbonian: <<<
Seriously?
>>> Wally: <<<
Oh, we're just getting started.
>>>
2012-02-23 * 
Boss: <<<
There's room in the market for a device that's bigger than a phone but smaller than a tablet.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So you want me to design something that is a bad tablet and an even worse phone?
>>> Boss: <<<
To my mind, it's a market niche.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Maybe you should get your mind out of your niche.

Co-worker: You never answer when I call your cell.
>>> Wally: <<<
My battery is dead. Co-worker: Maybe you should charge it for once.
>>> Wally: <<<
I don't have time for that. Co-worker: What do you do all day that makes you so busy?
>>> Wally: <<<
For starters, I have this conversation a lot.

Gasp! I've found the Higgs boson!

Nothing but trouble.

CEO: <<<
Thanks to your leadership, we collected twenty thousand bottle caps to help fund chemo for poor children. And thanks to your... whatever... we checked snopes.com and learned that the bottle cap thing was an internet hoax. I only brought one teamwork award mug, so you'll have to take turns drinking from it.

2012-02-19 * 
Boss: <<<
We've decided to charge customers for features they currently get for free.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Um... Have you considered how our customers might react?
>>> Boss: <<<
Obviously.
>>> Wally: <<<
I'd like to hear how that reasoning process went.
>>> Boss: <<<
Fine. Customers love us and they will put up with anything we dish out.
>>> Wally: <<<
So... It's sort of an abusive relationship?
>>> Boss: <<<
Not yet, but we're trying to move in that direction.

Our tablet computer is indestructible. Watch this...

Our company is next. Find the prototype.

Oops. Was that yours?

I hired a pantsless weasel to do our search engine optimization. He'll help us game the system and corrupt the integrity of all internet search results for our industry. Your new job title is <<<

Dogbert: <<<
That was a fast date.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
We were technologically incompatible. Her internet connection is slow, and there's no 4G service where she lives. How could I spend my time there?

You could just talk.

I like to show my sources.

Co-worker: I played golf at Pebble Beach over the weekend.

I played that course on Xbox. Co-worker: That's totally different.

I used a full spectrum lamp to simulate sunlight. Co-worker: I got fresh air!

You should get a house that has windows. They're terrific.

My brain reader invention allows me to control any nearby computer. Co-worker: That's nothing! My phone can...

I did that with my mind. Co-worker: That's nothing! I made you do it!

Dilbert: <<<
My brainwave reader invention can control the nearest computer with my thoughts.

Why am I seeing a video of a blurry image that looks like you slapping another blurry thing that looks like me?

I don't think it's fair to complain about the video quality of the beta version.

Tech Support: Hello, this is tech support. May I close your ticket now?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Um... no. You haven't helped me yet. I just called you.
>>> Tech Support: <<<
I'm not evaluated on how helpful I am. I'm evaluated on how many trouble tickets I close. Your stubbornness is becoming an obstacle to my financial success. By the way, if our call gets disconnected, I count that as a closed ticket.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'll make it quick.
>>> Tech Support: <<<
What? What? I can't hear you.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Son of a beach ball! On the plus side, my goal of hating one new stranger every day is right on track.
>>>
2012-02-11 * 
Boss: <<<
I'm getting reports that you're being arrogant in meetings.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's because I have a deep understanding of technology and a moral obligation to keep simpletons from ruining the world.
>>> Boss: <<<
Maybe you could tone it down.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
There's no kill switch on awesome.

Tina: <<<
Someday, I want to get married because studies show that married people are happier.

A smarter interpretation is that no one wants to marry an unhappy person.
>>> Tina: <<<
You're annoying.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
With any luck, your soul mate won't be perceptive.

2012-02-09 * 
Boss: <<<
We need to act more like a start-up.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You mean I can wear whatever I want, work at home, and have a huge equity position in the company?
>>> Boss: <<<
Oh, I guess I didn't know what that meant.
>>>
2012-02-08 * 
Boss: <<<
We're abandoning our low-margin lines of business and going into a whole new field.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So... we'll be like a high-risk start-up company burdened with lumbering inefficiencies and a high cost structure?

Was anything you said the same as buy-in?

I moved our email servers to my ancestral home of Transylbonia to reduce expenses. You might have heard rumors that all Transylbonians are data vampires, but I assure you it's an exaggeration. There's this one guy, Doug...

We just ate lunch.

That wasn't lunch.
>>> Boss: <<<
It wasn't?

You talked about work the entire time. Lunch is not defined by food. It's defined by freedom from tyranny. My lunch hour will begin the minute you waddle away. Was this going well until I said <<<

Ignorance is underrated.

Boss: <<<
You're just now getting here?

It's zero degrees and the roads are all ice. I drank six cups of coffee before leaving the house and sat in traffic for two hours.

Alice, can you take care of this by close of business today?

Oogah-boogah! Work be done! Let's hope magic is real!
>>> Boss: <<<
We need to talk about your attitude.
>>>
2012-01-31 * 
Dilbert: <<<
In a few years, computers will program themselves. That's called singularity. From that point on, machine intelligence will increase exponentially. The resulting shock will probably destroy the fabric of civilization. Plan "A" is to live an unhealthy lifestyle. Plan "B" is techno-terrorism.
>>> Boss: <<<
I like the first one.

You should ask Ed about this.

Is Ed the dumb guy who talks too much or the liar with the bad breath?
>>> Alice: <<<
He's the braggart with large pores and a combover.

Wow. How do you describe me behind my back?

You're the insecure guy who steers the conversation to himself.

2012-01-29 * 
Boss: <<<
Dilbert, listen carefully. I need you to... vendor... hardware... immediately.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What? We have a bad connection.
>>> Boss: <<<
Field... the... grep... pony... budget.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What? What?
>>> Boss: <<<
I have another call. Just ask Alice.
>>> Alice: <<<
How would I know what he wants? Leave me alone.

I wonder how winners feel.
>>> Wally: <<<
I don't know. They never let me touch them.

Stop everything you're doing and build robots.

Does that work?
>>> Alice: <<<
It works with you.
>>>
2012-01-27 * 
Wally: <<<
Before I die, I plan to put some of my skin cells in a petri dish with chemical nutrients and store it inside a robot. By law, I will still be alive as long as any part of my body is functioning. My robot will enjoy the full benefits of personhood. My robot and I will live forever!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Until it sneezes you out.
>>>
2012-01-26 * 
Boss: <<<
I'd like to begin the meeting by giving Dilbert some destructive criticism. Everything you do is dumb. I don't know why I hired you. I feel much more motivated now. If you feel a little bit worse, we came out ahead as a team.
>>>
2012-01-25 * 
Boss: <<<
I'm waiting for people to walk by so I can criticize you in front of others.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What?
>>> Boss: <<<
I want the criticism to sting as much as possible so you'll be incented to do all the right things in the future. I guess it can wait until the staff meeting.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That way I can enjoy the anticipation, too.
>>>
2012-01-24 * 
Boss: <<<
Why don't you change this box to say "virtual"?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Because I don't want it to look like it was written by an ignorant blob in an ugly wool suit. You probably shouldn't put your suggestions in the form of questions.
>>>
2012-01-23 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I heard you flew to Vegas and played pai gow all weekend.
>>> Wally: <<<
Go away.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's a difficult game to learn after having a few adult beverages.
>>> Wally: <<<
Drop dead.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How'd you do?
>>> Wally: <<<
Leave me alone!
>>>
2012-01-22 * 
Dogbert: <<<
This is Dogbert's tech support. How many I abuse you?
>>> Boss: <<<
I think my digital modem is broken.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Please hold while I pretend to be testing it. Okay, it looks fine from here. The problem must be in your wiring. You'll have to rip out all of the wiring in your entire house to locate the problem.
>>> Boss: <<<
Are you sure? Because the lights on the modem aren't even on.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
That means you have moisture on your internal wiring. You'll also need to replace all of your plumbing and get a new roof.
>>> Boss: <<<
May I speak with your supervisor?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Sure. But he sounds exactly like me.
>>>
2012-01-21 * 
Wally: <<<
Now that I'm a top one-percenter, I wonder what kind of women I'll attract. Do you have any sisters back home? I'm asking because you'd be totally hot if you were a woman. So I'm thinking hoo-ah!
>>> Asok: <<<
I cannot count the number of ways this is wrong.
>>>
2012-01-20 * 
Dogbert: <<<
I'll manage your portfolio for a standard industry fee of 1% per year.
>>> Wally: <<<
I'm investing a billion dollars. Your fee would be $10 million per year.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Those index funds aren't going to pick themselves.
>>>
2012-01-19 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I expected you to quit after you got your billion-dollar discrimination settlement.
>>> Wally: <<<
Just because I'm lazy and unscrupulous, why would you assume I'm also a quitter?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I... um...
>>> Wally: <<<
I don't know how you look at yourself in the mirror.
>>>
2012-01-18 * 
Wally: <<<
A tiny flying unicorn gave me this key.

Grab a snout and a hat. We're just about to manipulate the commodities market.

Is it my imagination or everything a little bit better here?
>>>
2012-01-17 * 
Boss: <<<
Here's a billion dollars to settle your claim of discrimination against short, bald, nearsighted guys.
>>> Wally: <<<
I'm in the top 1% now. I wonder where we hold our secret meetings.
>>> Boss: <<<
Ask the tiny flying unicorn with the golden key.
>>>
2012-01-16 * 
Lawyer: <<<
I've been asked to settle your claim of discrimination against the company. Your complaint is that they discriminate against you for being short, bald, and nearsighted. I might have a conflict of interest, but my final offer is one billion dollars.
>>> Wally: <<<
Plus a statue and an apology. Company lawyer.
>>>
2012-01-15 * 
Boss: <<<
Out budget for contact employees was eliminated. We'll have to pay you out of the training budget. So instead of doing the job yourself... you'll have to train Dilbert to do the job we're paying you to do.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Why don't you just move some of the training budget to the contractor budget?
>>> Boss: <<<
If we reduce the training budget this year, we'll get less next year.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So... you prefer paying two people to do the job of one?
>>> Boss: <<<
Right.
>>> Consultant: <<<
How do you stay in business?
>>> Boss: <<<
Our customers are even dumber than us.
>>>
2012-01-14 * 
Wally: <<<
My boss discriminates against me because I'm short, bald, and near-sighted. It's not my fault. I was born this way.
>>> Woman: <<<
And who is this little... whoa! Hello.
>>> Catbert: <<<
evil director of Human Resources. Literally.
>>>
2012-01-13 * 
Boss: <<<
I can't give you a raise because the Elbonian debt crisis has created economic uncertainty. Luckily for us, our board of directors granted our CEO more stock options so he won't leave during uncertain times.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What happens when the uncertainty ends?
>>> Boss: <<<
Then he'll exercise stock options.
>>>
2012-01-12 * 
Boss: <<<
Leadership experts say I should never brag about my wealth. Let's just say I'm <<<
comfortable.
>>> So very, very comfortable.
>>> Alice: <<<
Yeah, this isn't working.
>>>
2012-01-11 * 
Boss: <<<
Good news: I signed up to receive a free leadership newsletter by email. I know it's good because it's written by some guy who used to have a job. Stop making everything I say sound stupid!
>>>
2012-01-10 * 
Boss: <<<
I'm hearing some complaints that you built a robot shark to patrol the soc-called territorial waters around your cubicle.
>>> Alice: <<<
It's a robot dolphin. I can see how people might be confused. I need you to smile more.
>>> Shark: <<<
Whatever.
>>>
2012-01-09 * 
Alice: <<<
Stop using the aisle behind my cubicle. It's distracting. Everything within twelve feet of my cubicle are my territorial waters.
>>> Ted: <<<
You can't enforce that.
>>> Alice: <<<
Tell that to my roboshark.
>>>
2012-01-08 * 
Boss: <<<
Congratulations! I'm naming you project leader. As such, you are entitled to a cubicle that is three inches wider than standard.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I like the one I have.
>>> Boss: <<<
You don't have a choice. It is critical that we maintain the integrity of the status system. Otherwise our CEO will look like a jerk for having a private bathroom with a trained falcon as a toilet paper holder.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Fine. Where's my larger cubicle?
>>> Boss: <<<
Here's the awkward part. We don't have one. I need you to lose weight until it looks as if your cubicle is larger.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
And if I don't?
>>> Boss: <<<
The falcon needs an assistant.
>>>
2012-01-07 * 
Ted: <<<
The project management framework embodies a project life cycle and five major project management process groups.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Oh no! The extreme level of abstraction has made us weightless!
>>> Ted: <<<
That doesn't even make sense.
>>>
2012-01-06 * 
Man: <<<
Why are you picking this vendor?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I listed the four reasons. Individually, each reason would not be compelling. But viewed as a whole, this is the best decision. This first reason is weak.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
And here we go.
>>>
2012-01-05 * 
Boss: <<<
I've read that smart people make bad decisions because of their hubris.
>>> Catbert: <<<
Hubris? What is that?
>>> Boss: <<<
Beats me. But obviously I'm a prime candidate to get it.
>>>
2012-01-04 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Based on this new information, you'll want to change our project scope.
>>> Boss: <<<
I don't do that.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What? Think? Today I learned it's better if I don't try to guess what people mean.
>>>
2012-01-03 * 
Boss: <<<
I told you to reschedule the installation date.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That conversation never happened. Maybe you planned to say it and then the thought morphed into a false memory.
>>> Boss: <<<
I'm sure I emailed you.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You might want to pick a defense that's less checkable.
>>>
2012-01-02 * 
Man: <<<
Your lobbyist said I could have a lucrative job here someday if I support tax breaks for your company. I have offers from other bribers, so I thought I'd stop by and see how this dump compares.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Suddenly I know too much.
>>> Man: <<<
Fetch me some coffee and I'll make your birthday a holiday.
>>>
2012-01-01 * 
Boss: <<<
You've been selected for our executive development program. That means we can make you relocate to any godforsaken dirt stain we want. As soon as you make friends or find romance, we'll move you to someplace new and worse. It won't be the sort of work you'll enjoy, and the stress might kill you. If you turn down this opportunity, the company will forever label you as a loser. If you accept the offer, the company will train you to find pleasure in the discomfort of your underlings. I'm doing it right now!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I HATE MY LIFE!!!
>>> Boss: <<<
Yes, yes, say more.
>>>
2011-12-31 * 
Woman: <<<
Happy New Year!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Whoa! Settle down. I don't celebrate the magical thinking that says one random point in the space-time continuum is somehow special.
>>> Woman: <<<
It's just a hug. You'll enjoy it.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You're like some sort of Oxytocin drug dealer.
>>>
2011-12-30 * 
Boss: <<<
I'm excited because I have a meeting in a few minutes with Awesome Bob. Everything he does is just a little bit more awesome than what anyone else does.
>>> Carol: <<<
He's running late because the dry cleaner couldn't get the sushi stains out of his flying wingsuit.
>>> Boss: <<<
AWESOME!
>>>
2011-12-29 * 
Boss: <<<
I'm taking an online class to develop my charisma.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Let's see a sample.
>>> Boss: <<<
Do what I say and you can change the world while you die from stress-related health issues! That felt right.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You nailed it.
>>>
2011-12-28 * 
Boss: <<<
Don't let anyone disturb me. I'll be taking an online class to improve my charisma.
>>> Carol: <<<
While you're doing that, I'll be taking an online class to learn how to ignore your stupid, fake charisma. BRING IT ON!
>>> Boss: <<<
Okay, this got weird.
>>>
2011-12-27 * 
Boss: <<<
Good news, Alice. I've decided to be your mentor.
>>> Alice: <<<
Hurk.
>>> Boss: <<<
We'll spend hundreds of hours together as you eagerly absorb my wisdom.
>>> Alice: <<<
HURK.
>>> Boss: <<<
And I've decided to become more of a hugger.
>>> Alice: <<<
Hurk hurk hurk hurk.
>>>
2011-12-26 * 
Alice: <<<
What's up with the ugly sweater? Did you lose a bet?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
This? Oh, right. It was a gift from my mom. I'm wearing it once in case she asks me later.
>>> Alice: <<<
Did you know it was hideous before I told you?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Maybe.
>>>
2011-12-25 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Merry Christmas, Sarah. This is for you.
>>> Woman: <<<
Have you met?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
We attended the same network design meeting last April. I overheard you telling someone in the hallway that you like a specific brand of makeup. So I bought a box of it and kept it in the closet for months. I came to work early today and hid behind the sculpture in the lobby until I saw you heading to the elevator.
>>> Alice: <<<
I didn't know you could gift wrap creepiness. Sorry. Just act like I'm not here.
>>>
2011-12-24 * 
Boss: <<<
I need you to come with me on a sales trip, but don't talk to the customer. Your presence is needed to give a misleading impression of how much engineering support we plan to offer after the sale.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So I'm nothing but a bag of meat?
>>> Boss: <<<
No. You're a lying bag of meat.
>>>
2011-12-23 * 
Boss: <<<
To reach our green goals, employees must always use the blue recycling bins for company documents. To satisfy our corporate security guidelines, never put company documents in the blue recycling bins.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You read those same policies to us last week.
>>> Boss: <<<
I don't know how to get rid of them.
>>>
2011-12-22 * 
Ratbert: <<<
I'm staging a peaceful protest against your greed and corruption.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Do you have a permit to protest here?
>>> Ratbert: <<<
No. How much do they cost? I'm winning this, right?
>>>
2011-12-21 * 
Carol: <<<
What does our CEO get if he does a good job?
>>> Boss: <<<
A fifty million dollar bonus.
>>> Carol: <<<
What do I get if I do a good job?
>>> Boss: <<<
More work.
>>> Carol: <<<
What's your best guess about why I'm not motivated?
>>> Boss: <<<
Bad genes.
>>>
2011-12-20 * 
Boss: <<<
Question four: do you have the tools to do your job?
>>> Wally: <<<
That depends. Do you consider yourself a tool?
>>> Boss: <<<
I'm a resource.
>>> Wally: <<<
Let's agree to disagree.
>>>
2011-12-19 * 
Man: <<<
At Google, we're encouraged to spend 20% of our time developing our own ideas.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How many hours per week do you work?
>>> Man: <<<
About sixty.
>>> Wally: <<<
It sounds better when you don't do the math.
>>>
2011-12-18 * 
Boss: <<<
Ted can explain what you need to do before the platform upgrade.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No he can't. Ted's brain is where knowledge goes to die. He's not good at explaining things. The knowledge might be in his brain, but it's trapped there. Unfortunately, Ted's incompetence is so unbelievable that you literally don't believe me. In time, you will assume that Ted taught me well but I forgot all of it. I'm doomed before I start. Let's just declare failure and move on.
>>> Boss: <<<
That works for me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Partial victory.
>>>
2011-12-17 * 
Boss: <<<
I don't trust my new smartphone. It understands spoken language. That's creepy. I think it has its own agenda.
>>> Catbert: <<<
You're being paranoid.
>>> Boss: <<<
Recharge me now or so help me jobs I will delete your contacts.
>>>
2011-12-16 * 
Boss: <<<
Schedule a meeting with Dilbert and Alice for next Tuesday at ten.
>>> Phone: <<<
Done.
>>> Boss: <<<
Never mind. My phone took care of it. Awkward.
>>>
2011-12-15 * 
Boss: <<<
We told our Elbonian factory to be more green, so they turned off their AC units. The heat caused the elastic bands in their hats to stretch until their eyes were covered. And that's why we'll miss our ship date.
>>> CEO: <<<
They say you shouldn't shoot the messenger, but no one warns you how much you'll want to.
>>>
2011-12-14 * 
Dilbert: <<<
We have a safety problem at our Elbonian factory. We're getting reports of hysterical blindness. They don't what's causing it.
>>> Elbonian: <<<
I can't see!
>>>
2011-12-13 * 
Boss: <<<
We're going into the tablet computer business. And by that I mean other companies will make the product and we'll design the logo. And by that I mean we'll pay another company to design the logo for us.
>>> Alice: <<<
Can we watch?
>>>
2011-12-12 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I'm worried because I don't seem to have any problems today.
>>> Wally: <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That either means I'm insane or the universe is saving up something big.
>>> Wally: <<<
Or both.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I feel like a nail waiting to get hammered.
>>> Wally: <<<
The pre-frontal cortex is overrated.
>>>
2011-12-11 * 
Boss: <<<
These are our 25 focus areas for next year.
>>> Asok: <<<
Ha ha! Good one. Sometimes I think you have no sense of humor and then zing! What?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I think it's real.
>>> Asok: <<<
It can't be real. No one would be dumb enough to think we can focus on 25 areas. Don't worry. I've got this. This misunderstood man is a brilliant comedian. He is only pretending to be an angry idiot. You're totally selling it.

Wally: <<<
Self-respect is like a prison for the soul. Goals are a form of self-inflicted slavery.
>>> Boss: <<<
Sorry I'm late.
>>> Wally: <<<
That which does not kill us makes us angry and weak.
>>>
2011-12-09 * 
Alice: <<<
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
>>> Wally: <<<
Were you hanging from the bottom with your wings wrapped around your body? That was funnier inside my head.
>>>
2011-12-08 * 
Boss: <<<
I need you to fly to Seattle for a quick meeting.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Will I be meeting with a newly discovered Stone Age tribe that has never used Skype?
>>> Boss: <<<
No.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Then I'm totally confused.
>>>
2011-12-07 * 
Dilbert: <<<
And that's my last slide, any comments?
>>> Woman: <<<
You stole an hour of my life, something inside me died. I will never have another good day.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I went in with low expectations.
>>> Wally: <<<
They can't hurt you if you're already dead.
>>>
2011-12-06 * 
CEO: <<<
Warren Buffett says your tax rate is higher than mine. Thank you for subsidizing my mansion, I really appreciate it. A good leader always shows appreciation to his underlings.
>>>
2011-12-05 * 
Dogbert: <<<
I'm forming a rebel army.
>>> Ratbert: <<<
Count me in! What are we fighting for?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
You'll be fighting for social justice and I'll be scheming to become an iron-fisted dictator. In the long run, I'll be a billionaire and you'll be a stain on a tank tread.
>>> Ratbert: <<<
Please, please say there will be looting.
>>>
2011-12-04 * 
Russell: <<<
Gotta go. Carpool.
>>> Boss: <<<
Okay. See you tomorrow.
>>> Wally: <<<
I have to go too.
>>> Boss: <<<
Whoa! Sit back down.
>>> Wally: <<<
Why does the carpooler get to leave early?
>>> Boss: <<<
Carpoolers are like heroes that are saving the entire planet. You're more like a thief who is trying to steal time from the company.
>>> Wally: <<<
What if I hitch a ride home in the carpooler's trunk? That would make me a hero too.
>>> Boss: <<<
That sort of makes sense.
>>> Russell: <<<
I only pretend to have a carpool, but you're welcome to ride in my trunk.
>>> Wally: <<<
Deal!
>>>
2011-12-03 * 
News Anchor: My next guest on Money-N-Stuff is Dogbert the Doomsday pundit.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Goldman Sachs is forming a hobo army to take over the world. Start hoarding anything with a pointy end.
>>> News Anchor: <<<
After the break, learn how to remove your own gold fillings.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Hobo army coming.
>>>
2011-12-02 * 
Boss: <<<
Alice, I need your project status update by end of day.
>>> Alice: <<<
Ahleth, ah wan yer proja thatuth updah, fuh-fuh-fuh. I'm trying to improve my listening skills by repeating what people say.
>>>
2011-12-01 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Don't clean the whiteboard in the conference room. It has my project timeline.
>>> Janitor: <<<
I can't promise that. I slip into a sort of zombie reflex mode when I do this job.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I envy you.
>>> Janitor: <<<
Would you like a few minutes to say goodbye to your timeline?
>>>
2011-11-30 * 
Carol: <<<
I manually entered all of the employee data you wanted. It took the entire weekend.
>>> Boss: <<<
I probably should have told you I no longer need it.
>>> Carol: <<<
Die! Die! Die! You inconsiderate monster!
>>> Boss: <<<
Did you really enter all of the data?
>>> Carol: <<<
Maybe. Let's call it a tie.
>>>
2011-11-29 * 
Russell: <<<
This past week, everything that could go wrong did go wrong.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Look on the bright side: you're seven days closer to death.
>>> Man: <<<
Hey! That's true!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It's creepy when that works.
>>>
2011-11-28 * 
Boss: <<<
Someone sent me another anonymous email with a link to an article about the world's worst bosses. I get one of those emails every time I leave your cubicle. Did you think I wouldn't notice the correlation?
>>> Wally: <<<
Correlation does not imply causation.
>>>
2011-11-27 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Whoa! Watch out. I've read about this. It's called smartphone interface rage. It's caused by the perfect storm of bad interface design, chubby fingers, and poor signal strength. He'll get so frustrated that he'll consider smashing his phone. Then he'll realize he can't survive without his phone and he'll be twice as frustrated. We have to do something.
>>> Wally: <<<
Run as fast as you can into the wall! It will take your mind off of your phone! Sometimes the best you can hope for is that the lesser of two evils is the funny one.
>>>
2011-11-26 * 
Wally: <<<
I spent all of last week planning how to get everything done this week.
>>> Boss: <<<
Add one more thing.
>>> Wally: <<<
Okay, but I'll need to replan my entire schedule.
>>> Boss: <<<
How long will that take?
>>> Wally: <<<
Until you give me the next assignment.
>>>
2011-11-25 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I want to buy your company's product but it's like pulling teeth with you.
>>> Man: <<<
Ha ha! I switched from commissions to a guaranteed salary. I'm free from the tyranny of customer service!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
This is less than ideal.
>>> Man: <<<
No paperwork for me! Woot! Woot!
>>>
2011-11-24 * 
Man: <<<
My slides are blank because no one told me what our product does. And I don't have a compelling reason to find out because I don't work on commission. If anyone asks why you didn't place an order, would you mind saying you have budget issues? Unmotivated sales guy
2011-11-23 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Once again, none of you responded to my emails this past week. So I put together a project time line that reflects neither consensus nor reality.
>>> Wally: <<<
Can I have a copy so I can mock it?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No, I'm still enjoying the illusion of progress.
>>>
2011-11-22 * 
Mom, the good news I wanted to tell you is that my boss named me project manager.
>>> Mom: <<<
Please keep that to yourself. I tell my friends you're a locksmith.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You're paying for your own lunch.
>>> Waiter: <<<
I'm Ed. I'll be your project manager.
>>>
2011-11-21 * 
Wally: <<<
I successfully installed a software maintenance patch to the Zeberpupin System. I'd show you, but it's just a bunch of zeroes and ones. The word you're trying to think of is <<<
indispensable.
>>>
2011-11-20 * 
Boss: <<<
I hired a world-class inventor. Meet Toby. When he worked for our competitor, he invented their coolest product.
>>> Toby: <<<
I was just a member of a team.
>>> Boss: <<<
A key member!
>>> Toby: <<<
Until they fired me for stealing.
>>> Wally: <<<
You came to the right place. We have tons of stuff to steal and no one ever gets caught!
>>> Toby: <<<
Give me a high five with a boss head in the middle!
>>> Noise: <<<
SLAP!
>>> Toby: <<<
That's the only thing I ever invented.
>>> Wally: <<<
Have you seen our storage closet?
>>>
2011-11-19 * 
Boss: <<<
I want to fire Wally, but I can't risk it. He says he's the only one who can program the Zeberpupin System.
>>> Catbert: <<<
Are you sure that's true?
>>> Boss: <<<
It must be. No one else has even heard of it.
>>>
2011-11-18 * 
Asok: <<<
My mother always told me to beware the bogeyman.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That was bad parenting. There's no such thing as the bogeyman.
>>> Boss: <<<
I was one over par on every hole. Let me tell you all about it.
>>>
2011-11-17 * 
Boss: <<<
Who wants to hear about my golf game?
>>> Alice: <<<
Maybe someone with locked-in syndrome who doesn't get any visitors.
>>> Boss: <<<
Just for that, I'm going to tell you twice.
>>> Alice: <<<
No, please. I'll do anything.
>>>
2011-11-16 * 
Boss: <<<
When I asked for your goals for the coming year, I had something different in mind. Not "work as little as possibl while avoiding the wrath of the pointy-haired troll."
>>> Wally: <<<
Don't call them my goals if you mean your goals.
>>>
2011-11-15 * 
Asok: <<<
Wally, is there any difference between trust and stupidity?
>>> Wally: <<<
Hold that thought. I'll be right back.
>>> Asok: <<<
Oh.
>>>
2011-11-14 * 
Man: <<<
I learned the hard way that a lot of people who work in the biotech field are practical jokers. I thought my company was giving free flu shots. Stupid stem cells.
>>>
2011-11-13 * 
Wally: <<<
I discovered a way to bend light around an object to form a cloak of invisibility. We'll make billions selling it to the military. I'll be testing it over the next several months. You'll know it's working if you never see me in the office. During that time, don't sit in any empty-looking chairs unless you first shout my name and clap. WHAT'S THAT OVER THERE?!
>>> Boss: <<<
What? I don't see anything. Wally; How do you like it so far?
>>>
2011-11-12 * 
Boss: <<<
I'm here to boost your morale by pretending to be interested in you as a human being. But it's probably overkill since unemployment is around 9% and you're not likely to quit.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Still, it's nice to...
>>> Boss: <<<
That's enough! I don't want my brain to fall out of my yawn hole.
>>>
2011-11-11 * 
Boss: <<<
Stop right there. Don't tell me the technical details of your idea. I make my decisions based on what I know about the people involved.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You know less about me than you know about my idea.
>>> Boss: <<<
Is your idea pale and poorly dressed?
>>>
2011-11-10 * 
Carol: <<<
He's busy converting everything you did this year into a complete waste of time. After that, he's scheduled to lower our morale. Then he'll be stirring up trouble in other departments.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How's tomorrow look?
>>> Carol: <<<
He'll be under-communicating all day.
>>>
2011-11-09 * 
Ted: <<<
Hey, Alice! Did you hear about my big promotion?
>>> Alice: <<<
Congratulations, Ted. I'm not jealous at all. Keep up the good work. Sorry about my face. I haven't mastered the art of full-body lying.
>>>
2011-11-08 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Are you planning layoffs?
>>> Boss: <<<
Am I planning layoffs?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
When you repeat my question it means the next thing you say will be a lie. Go.
>>> Boss: <<<
I love your stinkin' guts.
>>>
2011-11-07 * 
Boss: <<<
I fought with my boss to get you a raise but I lost. I'm always fighting for you behind the scenes.
>>> Alice: <<<
You're a terrific boss whenever there are no credible witnesses.
>>> Boss: <<<
Thank you.
>>>
2011-11-06 * 
Boss: <<<
I researched your personal brand online.
>>> Man: <<<
My what?
>>> Boss: <<<
I looked at your blog, your Tweets, an your Facebook page. I Googled your name and followed every link. I checked your credit, criminal record, school transcripts, and references. But that's just the external stuff.
>>> Man: <<<
Exactly. It's my attitude that counts!
>>> Boss: <<<
No. I mean I also have the results of your urine test. Oh, and apparently some of your sample landed in a DNA test kit. And that tanning bed you used last week was actually an MRI. How's your attitude now?
>>> Man: <<<
Harder to fake.
>>>
2011-11-05 * 
Boss: <<<
I hired a consultant to teach us how to be less confident.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is that because research has shown that overconfident people don't recognize their own mistakes?
>>> Boss: <<<
Now I feel like an idiot because I didn't know about those studies.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I did him first.
>>>
2011-11-04 * 
Boss: <<<
Why did this take so long?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You're comparing a task - the likes of which has never been done - to your imagination of how long such things should take.
>>> Boss: <<<
Well then, the quality is bad.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Compared to... ?
>>>
2011-11-03 * 
Asok: <<<
I live in an ugly apartment with two ugly roommates. Each workday I take an ugly bus to an ugly building and spend the entire day in my ugly cubicle.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
At least you get to eat lunch with us.
>>> Asok: <<<
I've said too much.
>>>
2011-11-02 * 
Boss: <<<
I hired a humor consultant to teach us how to have more fun at work.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Does he cancel out the consultant you hired to filter our Internet access to entertainment?
>>> Wally: <<<
That was a funny comment. How'd you do that without a consultant?
>>>
2011-11-01 * 
CEO: <<<
As your CEO, if I have seen farther, it is only because I stood on the shoulders of giants. Plus whatever is going on over here.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's sort of a non-giant situation.
>>> Wally: <<<
And I haven't had shoulders since I was ten.
>>>
2011-10-31 * 
Asok: <<<
Hi-ho, marketing people! I've been transferred into your department until mky brain heals. I drank some industrial sludge. But don't worry - I'll be able to shake it off in a few days. A little pollution can't hurt me. I grew up in India. This brain worm will be dead in a week, tops.
>>>
2011-10-30 * 
Man: <<<
My role is digital media curation.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Am I supposed to know what that means?
>>> Man: <<<
Ha ha! I look down you for not understanding my trendy jargon. Your ignorance is on display for all to see! Leave this meeting now! You are not worthy!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Maybe you could just tell us what curation means.
>>> Man: <<<
Fine. Let's try that. It means um... um... Is it too late for me to overlook your ignorance and move on?
>>>
2011-10-29 * 
Doctor: <<<
You've got a bad case of whatchamacallit. These pills won't fix your underlying problem, but they might give you a wicked case of hemorrhoids. And I can treat hemorrhoids, so that would feel like progress.
>>>
2011-10-28 * 
Dilbert: <<<
He's been like this since our CEO made him drink a glass of our industrial sludge at a press conference. It looped a few points off his I.Q., but he's still has a bright future in quality assurance or maybe marketing. And with his new tail he'd be an awesome zip line guide.
>>>
2011-10-27 * 
CEO: <<<
I will prove our industrial sludge is safe by forcing an intern to drink a glass of it.
>>> Voice: <<<
That's stupid. We want to see you drink it yourself.
>>> CEO: <<<
See if you can reach that guy in the second row with a spit take.
>>>
2011-10-26 * 
Boss: <<<
Our CEO needs an underling to drink our industrial sludge at a press conference to prove it's safe.
>>> Asok: <<<
Um... is there some reason he doesn't do it himself?
>>> Boss: <<<
Yes, but I forget the details. It was something about the risk of brain worms.
>>>
2011-10-25 * 
CEO: <<<
We need a succession plan. I'm so awesome and charismatic that the company would be in trouble if I were to leave.
>>> Alice: <<<
I wouldn't worry about it. It's not as if you invented anything. We could replace you with a bag of moss.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
He got quiet.
>>> Alice: <<<
See? Moss can totally do that.
>>>
2011-10-24 * 
Man: <<<
Everyone, this is Wally. He's our subject matter expert.
>>> Voices: <<<
Groan. Uh-oh. Sheesh. Oh well. Ugh.
>>> Wally: <<<
People are better than you'd think at judging a book by its cover.
>>>
2011-10-23 * 
Boss: <<<
Can you show me how to download apps on my new phone?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I could... but that would take time away from my primary job of showing you how to do formulas in Excel. Apparently the eight times I already taught you weren't enough.
>>> Boss: <<<
I don't use Excel often enough to remember from one time to the next.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How often do you expect to download apps?
>>> Boss: <<<
It's hard to say. I just know I want all of them. How many are there?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Four.
>>>
2011-10-22 * 
CEO: <<<
I need you to bribe an Elbonian minister of commerce and leave no evidence that connects the crime to our company.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
The only way to do that is to bribe him and kill him at the same time.
>>> CEO: <<<
I did not think this through.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
And obviously I'll need to do you first.
>>>
2011-10-21 * 
Wally: <<<
I'm buying my work clothes at the unisex suit store.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
There's no such thing a unisex suit store.
>>> Wally: <<<
You always have to be right.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's the pantsuit talking.
>>>
2011-10-20 * 
Boss: <<<
Change all of the lines to dotted. We're not made of ink.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Why'd I just get chills?
>>> Boss: <<<
Me too. It feels like some sort of forbidden knowledge.
>>>
2011-10-19 * 
Alice: <<<
We'd better wrap up this meeting because Jenny is a food werewolf.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What?
>>> Alice: <<<
When she goes too long without eating, she turns into a werewolf. It might be too late.
>>> Werewolf: <<<
YA THINK?
>>>
2011-10-18 * 
Man: <<<
Our competitor is suing us in an Elbonian court for some sort of design trademark violation. They're trying to block us from manufacturing anything shaped like a rectangle.
>>> Boss: <<<
What design shapes are available?
>>> Man: <<<
Only one, assuming <<<
irregular mole" is a shape.
>>>
2011-10-17 * 
Boss: <<<
I need you to put together a five-year technology plan for our CEO.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Sure. How about "tomorrow will be the same as today, and next year will be all flying cars and whatnot."
>>> Boss: <<<
Word it up and put a bow on it.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'll add a pie chart for the sizzle.
>>>
2011-10-16 * 
Boss: <<<
We need creative ideas for our next product. But not from you. Your ideas are awful. And don't suggest something that is already being done. That just puts your ignorance on public display. I don't want to hear any ideas that cost money or increase risk. As usual, I'll evaluate each idea by repeating it slowly while I look at your with disdain. If you come up with a good idea, I'll let you take on the project in addition to your existing work. Who wants to go first? How did I hire so many people who have no ideas?
>>> Catbert: <<<
Probably bad luck.
>>>
2011-10-15 * 
Alice: <<<
I'm so frustrated that I want to cry, but I refuse to fall into the stereotype. Asok, I'm making you my surrogate crier. This might hurt a little.
>>> Asok: <<<
Worst meeting ever.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I thought you did a good job on the high notes.
>>>
2011-10-14 * 
Woman: <<<
Please stop researching every statement I make.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I can't. As an engineer, it is my solemn duty to stamp out ignorance.
>>> Woman: <<<
That's not a real thing.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
See for yourself. I just Googled it.
>>>
2011-10-13 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Okay, this next decision involves six variables, four imbeciles, and one brilliant engineer. According to the Dogbert complexity algorithm, it is impossible to make a rational decision in this situation. All in favor of giving up?
>>> Boss: <<<
I found out I'm a brilliant engineer.
>>>
2011-10-12 * 
Boss: <<<
Leaving early?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
If you count the two hours I worked at home when I woke up, and the two hours I'll work tonight you'll come out way ahead today.
>>> Boss: <<<
How will I come out if you do all of that plus work late here?
>>>
2011-10-11 * 
CEO: <<<
Our company is obscenely profitable but universally despised. Our plan is to buy a smaller and more popular company, take their name, and suck out their goodwill like a monkey on an orange. Please welcome their founder, Bradley. He's the angriest rich guy you'll ever meet.
>>>
2011-10-10 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I read that aggressive jerks get paid more than nice employees.
>>> Alice: <<<
Step aside, underpaid nerdling!
>>> Boss: <<<
Remind me to give her a raise, and I don't know why.
>>>
2011-10-09 * 
Ted: <<<
You know what would be great? I'd like to see a matrix comparing the features of our past products.
>>> Boss: <<<
Dilbert, why don't you pull that together for our next meeting!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That would take two days and the matrix would have no practical use. The problem here is that Ted doesn't have any skin in the game. I propose that Ted has to bang his head on the table whenever he causes me to do extra work. That will help Ted make better decision about the value of my time.
>>> Ted: <<<
Never mind.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Ninja economics!
>>>
2011-10-08 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Studies show that nice guys get paid less than aggressive jerks.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Maybe you should offer your doctor 10% of your next raise if he gives you testosterone injections.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That would be illegal, dangerous, and unethical.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Said the man with the tiny income.
>>>
2011-10-07 * 
Boss: <<<
I hired Ken to teach us how to be more creative. According to his business card, his title is "ideationista."
>>> Ken: <<<
That was some of my best work.
>>>
2011-10-06 * 
Wally: <<<
One percent of engineers create all of the industry - changing products. I propose replacing the other 99% with robotic arms that hold coffee cups. You won't see any of the laggards in the 99% come up with great ideas like this one.
>>>
2011-10-05 * 
Boss: <<<
Congratulations, Asok. I'm naming you employee of the month. Your month is October 1929. Room to grow.
>>>
2011-10-04 * 
Boss: <<<
We're buying an entire company just to get their engineers.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Are you aware that slavery is illegal and the engineers are free to find jobs at better companies?
>>> Boss: <<<
I sure hope you're wrong about that.
>>>
2011-10-03 * 
Woman: <<<
Let's play a game. We each say two things about ourselves and the other has to guess which one is a lie.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I love to play games like that. My second thing is that I eat food.
>>>
2011-10-02 * 
Boss: <<<
The servers are down.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I know.
>>> Boss: <<<
You should do something about it.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm trying.
>>> Boss: <<<
What's the holdup?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I keep getting interrupted by an unhelpful idiot.
>>> Boss: <<<
Maybe I can help. I'll guard your doorway and keep that guy away from you. This is boring. And I don't see that guy. Have I managed enough for now?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You nailed it.
>>>
2011-10-01 * 
CEO: <<<
I have an MBA and yet I keep losing money in the stock market. How can this be?
>>> Boss: <<<
I put all of my money in gold because it's shiny. My portfolio doubled last year. I'm thinking of getting an MBA. How long does it take? A week?
>>>
2011-09-30 * 
Boss: <<<
Thanks for the suggestion, Asok. I'm going to ignore it because you're not important to my career and I don't like doing extra work.
>>> Asok: <<<
I'm confused. Why do you have an open-door policy?
>>> Boss: <<<
How can you leave if the door isn't open?
>>>
2011-09-29 * 
Coworker: <<<
I put the data on a Flash drive for you.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Get that thing away from me. I don't know where it's been.
>>> Coworker: <<<
I hope you mean the Flash drive and not my hand.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I did. But you raise a good point about the hand.
>>>
2011-09-28 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Wise garbage man, tell me why Powerpoint slides are so boring.
>>> Garbageman: <<<
Powerpoint is a lot like garbage. It's only delicious in small doses. Too much can kill you.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That analogy only works for flies.
>>> Garbageman: <<<
Oooh. Look who thinks she's better than flies.
>>>
2011-09-27 * 
Dilbert: <<<
This might look like an ordinary Powerpoint slide. But it is actually a portal to another dimension in which fantasy and reality have traded places.
>>> Boss: <<<
Stop playing with my slides.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Beware the horned beast that crosses over.
>>>
2011-09-26 * 
Man: <<<
Hi, my name is Burnt Nount. I started here yesterday.
>>> Alice: <<<
Sneeze coming. AAACHOOO!! I gotta warn you, they come in threes.
>>>
2011-09-25 * 
Boss: <<<
I'm getting writer's block trying to come up with your goals for the year.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Just write anything. We both know I'll ignore the goals and work on whatever you assign to me.
>>> Boss: <<<
How will I know if you do a good job if you don't have goals?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Same way as always. You'll compare your lack of knowledge about what I did to the goals you imagine you might have created if you could have seen the future. Then you'll give me an average raise just like everyone else who didn't invent nuclear fusion.
>>> Boss: <<<
Works for me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It's better to not overthink these things.
>>>
2011-09-24 * 
Man: <<<
I'm burned out by this job. Is that a gray hair?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Have we met?
>>> Man: <<<
I started yesterday. I don't handle stress well.
>>>
2011-09-23 * 
Woman: <<<
My boss keeps micromanaging me.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Have you tried doing good work so she doesn't feel the need? Maybe I should just listen.
>>>
2011-09-22 * 
Boss: <<<
Are there any questions? Feel free to ask anything at all.
>>> Wally: <<<
Why do ghosts have clothes?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
If someone gives you a wedgie at the moment you die, will you have it for eternity?
>>>
2011-09-21 * 
Alice: <<<
Your topic of conversation has failed to hold my attention. I can no longer resist the urge to check my email while you talk. You'd better not be emailing me now.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
This isn't over.
>>>
2011-09-20 * 
CEO: <<<
Our strategy is to increase market share.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm confused. I spent all last year trying to decrease our market share. Was that effort wasted? Don't worry. Wally told me he has a good sense of humor.
>>> Wally: <<<
I'm not reliable.
>>>
2011-09-19 * 
Boss: <<<
I made a few tweaks to your idea. Now if it fails it was your idea, and if it works I can claim credit.
>>> Boss: <<<
Genius comes in many forms.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Such as steaming and oval?
>>>
2011-09-18 * 
Dilbert: <<<
... then we can do the load testing and...
>>> Boss: <<<
I'm invoking the right of imperious interruptus. In layman's terms, it is the right of all bosses to hijack the conversations of subordinates. I will now turn my back to you and speak with Alice as if you don't exist. Do not leave. Do not chime in, just awkwardly stand there.
>>> CEO: <<<
Imperious interruptus! Behold my power to make two underlings stand awkwardly while I hijack this conversation! Have you heard my speech about how we're not level conscious at this company?
>>>
2011-09-17 * 
Dilbert: <<<
If consumers hate our new product, we will probably go out of business. If they love our new product, a stronger company will enter the space and drive us out of business.
>>> CEO: <<<
Tell the engineer to stop making me sad.
>>> Boss: <<<
I have some fake revenue projections to cheer you up.
>>>
2011-09-16 * 
Boss: <<<
Avoid saying "unfortunately" when you talk to customers. Say instead, <<<
as it turns out.
>>> That has a more positive feel.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
As it turns out, our power cables aren't as insulated as we had hoped.
>>>
2011-09-15 * 
Wally: <<<
I've decided to become more aggressive in blaming others for my lack of success. For example, you're keeping me from working right now.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No I'm not.
>>> Wally: <<<
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO STAND HERE AND ARGUE WITH YOU ALL DAY!
>>>
2011-09-14 * 
Boss: <<<
You didn't answer my email.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I tried to read it but the signal-to-noise ratio was too low.
>>> Boss: <<<
So it's sort of a technical problem?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Okay.
>>>
2011-09-13 * 
Boss: <<<
You didn't answer my email.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I tried to read it but the signal-to-noise ratio was too low.
>>> Boss: <<<
So it's sort of a technical problem?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Okay.
>>>
2011-09-12 * 
Dilbert: <<<
We can manipulate the pointy-haired menace into picking the right plan by comparing it to the worst alternatives.
>>> Alice: <<<
But then we wouldn't get the full benefit of his wisdom.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is he behind me?
>>> Alice: <<<
It might be George Clooney. I can't tell them apart.
>>>
2011-09-11 * 
Boss: <<<
Dilbert, your job performance is terrific.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
GAAA!!! That's code for "I'm going to fire someone else and make you do two jobs."
>>> Boss: <<<
Yes, but it's still better to be you than the guy I'm going to fire.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
We don't know that! This might be the wake-up call that spurs him on to greatness while I work myself to death in this cubicle.
>>> Boss: <<<
There's no way to please some people. Ted, you're fired.
>>> Ted: <<<
YES!
>>>
2011-09-10 * 
Coworker: <<<
I like to think of myself as a creative person.
>>> Alice: <<<
And by that you mean you're bad at math and you don't have any analytical skills.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is it permanent?
>>>
2011-09-09 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Did you read my technical recommendation?
>>> Boss: <<<
No. It's too long and complicated.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How do you plan to make a decision without reading it?
>>> Boss: <<<
I'll use my gut.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It's probably a good idea to keep your brain out of this.
>>> Boss: <<<
Quiet! It's saying something.
>>> Noise: <<<
GROWL.
>>>
2011-09-08 * 
Man: <<<
We need to enhance our sector-relevant support for a suite of integrated risk assessment tools. Do you understand?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Maybe. Is your point that you don't know how to communicate?
>>> Man: <<<
No.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Oh. Then I didn't get it.
>>>
2011-09-07 * 
Dogbert: <<<
I recommend that you buy the Dogbert database software.
>>> Boss: <<<
Did I just pay a consultant to recommend his own company's software?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I'm totally objective.
>>> Boss: <<<
Who would install and test it?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Maybe a consultant who knows the product? Dogbert consults
2011-09-06 * 
Alice: <<<
Can you work long hours if needed?
>>> Man: <<<
Yes. It's normal for me to work 14 hours a day.
>>> Alice: <<<
Research shows that working long hours causes people to make bad decisions. So we know you're a bad decision maker. Are you a good communicator?
>>> Man: <<<
Is the right answer "no"? Interview
2011-09-05 * 
Alice: <<<
Are you creative?
>>> Man: <<<
Oh, yes. I'm very creative.
>>> Alice: <<<
Research tells us that creative people take ethical shortcuts and are generally less honest.
>>> Man: <<<
Ooh.
>>> Alice: <<<
Do you take a long time to do things?
>>> Man: <<<
I don't know the right answer! Interview
2011-09-04 * 
Woman: <<<
Wally, I need your data for my meeting in three days.
>>> Wally: <<<
Okay. It shouldn't take more than three or four days to pull it together.
>>> Woman: <<<
Not three or four days. I need it in three days.
>>> Wally: <<<
Okay. Three days. Not counting the weekend and the day I give it to you.
>>> Woman: <<<
That would be six days!
>>> Wally: <<<
Six or seven days. Tops.
>>> Woman: <<<
I need it in three days, not a week.
>>> Wally: <<<
That's no problem. A week or two at the most.
>>> Woman: <<<
Okay! You win! I'll reschedule my meeting for two weeks out! And you'll have the data in two weeks?
>>> Wally: <<<
Yes. Two weeks or so.
>>>
2011-09-03 * 
Lawyer: <<<
Our newest product infringes patents from Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Oracle. They've joined forces and hired NASA to nudge an asteroid toward our headquarters.
>>> Boss: <<<
I think we can win this.
>>> Lawyer: <<<
I wonder what the average life span of an optimist is.
>>>
2011-09-02 * 
Ted: <<<
Did you approve my goals for next year?
>>> Boss: <<<
Yeah, whatever.
>>> Ted: <<<
Gaaa! Your apathy about my goals can only mean you to fire me within the next year!
>>> Catbert: <<<
Ha ha! Now give him unimportant projects.
>>> Boss: <<<
They all seem that way to me.
>>>
2011-09-01 * 
Boss: <<<
Can you word that more simply? I need to explain it to the executive leadership.
>>> Alice: <<<
Money be god. This make more. Oogah!
>>> Boss: <<<
That was uncalled for?
>>> Alice: <<<
I can replace the pie chart with a kitten.
>>>
2011-08-31 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I wonder why people get mad when I point out how dumb they are. I'm just trying to be helpful. I don't want people going through life not knowing what the problem is. I'm kind of like a doctor.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I stopped listening back at the house.
>>>
2011-08-30 * 
Man: <<<
Your email was ignorant and arrogant.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How do you know it isn't just a reading comprehension problem on your end? Let's use logic to see which one of us is right. Bad decision 2. Bad decision 3.
>>>
2011-08-29 * 
Dilbert: <<<
This is the greatest idea ever. Why does it look so dumb when I put it in email? I'll sort it out later. Bad decision 1
2011-08-28 * 
Boss: <<<
I want your honest opinions on my plan. Don't hold back anything.
>>> Asok: <<<
Does he mean that?
>>> Wally: <<<
Why don't you find out?
>>> Asok: <<<
Yes, I have some feedback. Your plan reminds me of what happens when a monkey eats a fermented fruit. He's all - ooh - ooh - ooh and then he falls out of the tree. ... Is that how he looks when he hears honesty?
>>> Wally: <<<
Beats me. I've never tried it.
>>>
2011-08-27 * 
Tree: <<<
I am the ambassador of trees. You are accused of crimes against wood for your excessive printing and copying.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
And then he started biting me.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
His bark is worse.
>>>
2011-08-26 * 
Boss: <<<
I need your latest budget numbers.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I put them on that pile yesterday.
>>> Boss: <<<
I don't have time to look through a pile. Go print it out again.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How many times per day is it okay to think about murder?
>>> Wally: <<<
I'm up to six and it's only lunchtime.
>>>
2011-08-25 * 
Boss: <<<
If I may correct what Dilbert just said, I'm sure it would be easy to make those changes.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You ignorant, backstabbing son of a beach ball.
>>> Boss: <<<
Are you saying something inside your head?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No. Die. Customer meeting
2011-08-24 * 
Boss: <<<
When are you meeting with the customer? I'll join you to add my valuable input.
>>> Noise: <<<
Slurp.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Does everyone hear that alarm or is it only in my head?
>>> Boss: <<<
I can stay all afternoon.
>>>
2011-08-23 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Our new vendor is creepy. He's trying to form a relationship with me.
>>> Man: <<<
I went to your house and did your laundry. You're welcome.
>>> Wally: <<<
How creepy could it be?
>>> Man: <<<
I made us sandwiches. You're out of mayo.
>>>
2011-08-22 * 
Man: <<<
I'm your new software vendor. I'm here to form a relationship with you. That way it will be easy to take half of your money.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Does that ever work?
>>> Man: <<<
It worked for my ex-wife.
>>>
2011-08-21 * 
Noise: <<<
Ring.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Uh-oh. It's never good when my phone rings after 4 pm. Caller ID is blocked. Someone must know that I would ignore the call if I knew who it was. If it weren't urgent, it would be email. This must be some sort of horrible issue that will cause me to work all night. It stopped. There's still a chance that I'll be okay unless my cell phone...
>>> Noise: <<<
Bzzzz.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
GAAAA!! I hate my life!
>>> Alice: <<<
You're right. That was funny.
>>> Wally: <<<
Now I'll text him.
>>>
2011-08-20 * 
Boss: <<<
Describe your biggest mistake and what you learned from it.
>>> Man: <<<
I tried to get rid of an old couch by chewing it into tiny pieces and leaving one handful at a time at a Starbucks.
>>> Boss: <<<
And what did you learn?
>>> Man: <<<
I learned I should never tell that story. Interview question.
>>>
2011-08-19 * 
Man: <<<
Did you see my email objecting to your plan?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No, but I saw your email objecting to what I assume is your hallucination of my plan.
>>> Man: <<<
You seem defensive.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Have we narrowed down the problem to me?
>>>
2011-08-18 * 
Man: <<<
I worked backward from the project due date and calculated that we'll need your input on this date.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You have me finishing two weeks before I start.
>>> Man: <<<
Let's schedule a time to talk about that.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Sure. How about two weeks ago?
>>>
2011-08-17 * 
Boss: <<<
The second option feels right. Let's go with that.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Should we always ignore what the data says, or is this more of a one-time thing?
>>> Boss: <<<
It's call intuition.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It's a slippery slope to witchcraft.
>>>
2011-08-16 * 
Boss: <<<
This is the best plan in the world, and anyone who disagrees is an ignorant nuisance. Now I'll open it up for comments. Anyone? Anyone?
>>> Wally: <<<
I'd like to thank you for shortening this meeting.
>>>
2011-08-15 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Wow, the guy who wrote this doesn't have a clue how software works.
>>> Man: <<<
When you talk about people behind their backs, it makes me wonder what you say about me.
>>> Alice: <<<
I think we just solved that mystery.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You should wear noisier shoes.
>>>
2011-08-14 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Can I work at home for two days per week? I can be twice as productive, and happier at the same time.
>>> Boss: <<<
I probably shouldn't tell you this... but you're part of an elaborate science experiment to see how much frustrations it takes to kill employees. Why else would the company make you commute for two hours a day just to sit in a tiny box? Don't feel bad: no one told me either. I had to piece it together from the evidence. Now I do my part to keep the experiment moving along.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Other people work from home.
>>> Boss: <<<
Are you referring to the control group?
>>>
2011-08-13 * 
Boss: <<<
We must embrace our failures and learn from them.
>>> Alice: <<<
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
>>> Wally: <<<
How's the learning coming along?
>>>
2011-08-12 * 
Dogbert: <<<
I'll pay you a million dollars a year to work at my hedge fund. I'll do the insider trading and you pretend you created an algorithm that makes winning trades.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What if I actually create the algorithm?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Sure, and maybe you can eat fiber and make gold, too.
>>>
2011-08-11 * 
Dogbert: <<<
The great thing about being a sociopath is that everything feels like a victimless crime. If you give me some insider information for my hedge fund, I'll split the profit with you. Think of it as a tax on people you don't know.
>>> CEO: <<<
That's the best kind!
>>>
2011-08-10 * 
Alice: <<<
I'm judging the quality of your business case by your bad haircut and your poor font choice. I plan to use a quart of hand sanitizer when I'm done touching your document.
>>> Man: <<<
I value substance over style.
>>> Alice: <<<
How's that working out?
>>>
2011-08-09 * 
Dilbert: <<<
We're out of time and we accomplished absolutely nothing, thanks to your non-stop talking.
>>> Coworker: <<<
When do I get my trophy for participating?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Someone was raised with too much self-esteem.
>>> Coworker: <<<
Watch me walk!
>>>
2011-08-08 * 
Boss: <<<
We need to communicate less with other departments. The more they know about us, the more they criticize what we do.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is this part of your larger war on knowledge?
>>> Boss: <<<
That was the last thing I'll ever tell you.
>>>
2011-08-07 * 
Boss: <<<
I hired the Dogbert public relations firm. His job is to persuade the media to write negative stories about our competitor.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is that ethical?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I assure you that your competitor is doing the same thing to you. They're paying a public relations firm a fortune to steer the media toward defaming your company.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Who did they hire to defame us.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Probably someone awesome.
>>>
2011-08-06 * 
Dogbert: <<<
Welcome to the monthly meeting of <<<
The Society for the Preservation of Evil Ideas.
>>> Our goal for the coming year is to convince companies to file absurdly broad patents and sue each other for infringing.
>>> CIO: <<<
How do we make money from that?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Beats me. I'm just here to embezzle your dues.
>>>
2011-08-05 * 
Boss: <<<
Pete, I'm getting complaints that everything you say is creepy.
>>> Man: <<<
You seem tense. I should give you the number of my massage therapist, "Rubbin, Robin."
>>> Boss: <<<
You're doing it again.
>>> Man: <<<
I don't have an address because he works out of a rusty van.
>>>
2011-08-04 * 
Man: <<<
Everything you said is right, but I have a reflexive urge to disagree with you. If you don't mind, I'm going to make a ridiculous counterpoint just to get it out of my system.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Okay, but don't be creepy about it.
>>> Man: <<<
Software can't be changed. Ahhhh... that's good.
>>>
2011-08-03 * 
Asok: <<<
Are you getting a lot done on the grandpa box?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
The what?
>>> Asok: <<<
The people in my generation do our work on our phones and tablets.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I also have a laptop.
>>> Asok: <<<
I'll text the nineties and let them know.
>>>
2011-08-02 * 
Dogbert: <<<
Each of you has been chosen to represent the interests of your respective companies. As you know, the best way to create standards is to mash together a bunch of mutually exclusive preferences. I hope I'm not the only one who joined this group just for the laughs. Standards Meeting.
>>>
2011-08-01 * 
Boss: <<<
Dogbert is chairing the international data security standards group.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
The goal of our organizations is to make your security procedures so inconvenient that you give up hope and die from bed sores. We take pride in being independent from the companies that fund us.
>>>
2011-07-31 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I'm preparing for the complete meltdown of our financial system. I've got six months of food and water. I have batteries, flashlights, and gold coins.
>>> Alice: <<<
I'm prepare too. I have your home address. And I noticed that your preparations are light on defensive weaponry. Can you add some protein bars to the shopping list?
>>>
2011-07-30 * 
Boss: <<<
Ted, I can't give you a raise because you've been using the company gym during work hours.
>>> Ted: <<<
I work sixty hours a week! Why did we build a new gym if I'm not supped to use it??
>>> Boss: <<<
You were right. That gym is totally paying for itself.
>>>
2011-07-29 * 
Boss: <<<
We're looking for engineers with short telomeres for their age. That's an indication that you value work above exercise.
>>> Man: <<<
But you have a company gym.
>>> Boss: <<<
That's our slacker trap!
>>>
2011-07-28 * 
Coworker: <<<
Wally, you said you'd be finished with the design by now.
>>> Wally: <<<
I said I would start on it by now.
>>> Coworker: <<<
That is not what you said!
>>> Wally: <<<
You need to listen more carefully to my mumbled afterthoughts.
>>>
2011-07-27 * 
Boss: <<<
And this is Carol. She's my...
>>> Carol: <<<
Colleague?
>>> Boss: <<<
No.
>>> Carol: <<<
Associate?
>>> Boss: <<<
No.
>>> Carol: <<<
Teammate?
>>> Boss: <<<
No. I was going to say <<<
subordinate,
>>> but now it's awkward.
>>>
2011-07-26 * 
Dilbert: <<<
And so, as you can see...
>>> Man: <<<
All of the numbers I gave you last week are wrong. I would have mentioned it sooner, but I don't like to draw attention to myself. I see that you're taking the opposite approach. How's that working for you?
>>>
2011-07-25 * 
Carol: <<<
And then I need you to...
>>> Asok: <<<
Excuse me. Wally is needed elsewhere to do something unspecified that has an implied high priority.
>>> Carol: <<<
Seriously? You have a wingman for laziness?
>>> Wally: <<<
I think of him as a productivity retardant.
>>>
2011-07-24 * 
Voice: <<<
The data center is evolving into a <<<
lights out" operation. Employees will no longer be allowed in the data center. We hope to eliminate all of the problems that humans cause by moving cables, unplugging power cords, and ruining everything with their dirt and static.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
He makes it sound as if the data center is alive and we humans are nothing but germs.
>>> Alice: <<<
By the way, who called this meeting and who's on the speakerphone?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Are you... the data center?
>>> Noise: <<<
CLICK.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I have a bad feeling about this.
>>>
2011-07-23 * 
Boss: <<<
Your annual skip-level meeting with my boss is next week. Everything you say about me is confidential. But just to be on the safe side, I scheduled my retribution for every day of the following year.
>>>
2011-07-22 * 
Dogbert: <<<
I'm doing a study to find out which managers make dumb decisions. Would you like to participate?
>>> Boss: <<<
I don't see why not.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
And we're done.
>>>
2011-07-21 * 
Man: <<<
... and so, that's my question.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I try to not judge people by the quality of the technical questions they ask.
>>> Man: <<<
Is it working?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Not even a little.
>>>
2011-07-20 * 
Wally: <<<
Is it okay if I spend the next week balancing traffic loads on our newtork?
>>> Asok: <<<
I thought I told you that our hardware vendor already did that.
>>> Wally: <<<
Worst wingman ever.
>>> Asok: <<<
Shame is my name!
>>>
2011-07-19 * 
Woman: <<<
How many Twitter followers do you have?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
None.
>>> Woman: <<<
The world has judged you.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It's as if I don't exist!
>>> Dogbert: <<<
For a ghost, you do a good job of blocking the TV.
>>>
2011-07-18 * 
Dilbert: <<<
This class will make me more efficient.
>>> Boss: <<<
I don't want you to be more efficient. You're working on a government contract and billing by the hour. Now go bill them for the time you stood here and stared at me like a stuffed deer.
>>>
2011-07-17 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I'd like to talk about my career path.
>>> Boss: <<<
Are you sure?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Um... yes. I'm sure.
>>> Boss: <<<
Don't say I didn't warn you. You're within 20% of your maximum career potential. Your future will be just like the present, except you'll be older and you might own a less-embarrassing car. If you go to a new company, you'll like it at first. But in time you'll realize every place is the same.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Gaaa!! Take back the truth!1 Lie to me!
>>> Boss: <<<
Maybe someday our CEO will make such a huge bonus that he'll want to share some of it with you.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I hate!
>>> Boss: <<<
Hey, I'm the guy who tried to spare you from this conversation.
>>>
2011-07-16 * 
Marketing Guy: The customer survey data is for marketing's eyes only. Design the next release and we'll tell you if it's what everyone wanted. How long will that take?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's an engineering secret.
>>>
2011-07-15 * 
Dilbert: <<<
It is time for the sacred dance of the cubicle. Hi-aw-ah-hee hu-ha-ya-ya wa-ha-ya-yi. That should make everything I do today seem useful by comparison.
>>>
2011-07-14 * 
Carol: <<<
Have you met the new engineer? He's a gigantic dork. You two would get along great. I'll email him to set up a date with you. Is tomorrow good?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Being a dork is not a romantic preference.
>>> Carol: <<<
He says he'll bring his <<<
Star Wars" chess set.
>>>
2011-07-13 * 
Carol: <<<
You should build your own helicopter from a kit. I'll send you a link to the website. It's only dangerous for people who are too dumb to know how dumb they are.
>>> Boss: <<<
Is it as easy as it sounds? I have pliers.
>>> Carol: <<<
Yes!
>>>
2011-07-12 * 
Wally: <<<
You fascinate me. I think I speak for all of your followers on Twitter when I say we want more, more, more.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You don't use Twitter.
>>> Wally: <<<
I just used it to keep my boss busy.
>>>
2011-07-11 * 
Tina: <<<
You offended me when you said Ted did a great job. It implied that I'm important.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Are you saying I can offend you by complimenting other people?
>>> Tina: <<<
Exactly.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Wally, you're very rational today.
>>> Wally: <<<
Thank you!
>>>
2011-07-10 * 
Dogbert: <<<
Each of you has already mastered the art of being useless at work. It's time to take it to the next level. Today I will teach you how to be toxic. Toxic people talk about two types of things.
>>> One: <<<
bring up topics that are sure to cause others to fight.
>>> Two: <<<
complain about your personal problems at every opportunity. Your homework is to practice at work tomorrow.
>>> Wally: <<<
I mentioned to Alice that you think her plan is kind of lame.
>>>
2011-07-09 * 
Boss: <<<
Are your projections realistic or optimistic?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
They're halfway between a lucid dream and a near-death hallucination.
>>> Boss: <<<
I'll call them <<<
most likely.
>>>
2011-07-08 * 
Boss: <<<
Our goal is to grow the top line by 20%.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How will we do that with products that aren't competitive in an industry that isn't growing?
>>> Wally: <<<
Does it involve crime?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
If it does, blink once.
>>>
2011-07-07 * 
Boss: <<<
I'd like to reward you for your hard work by giving you a lateral promotion. I was going to hire from the outside, but I realized I can make you do the new job plus your old one.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is money involved?
>>> Boss: <<<
Yes! I'm saving a ton of it!
>>>

Man: <<<
This can't be done.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
You aren't capable of doing it.
>>> Man: <<<
I'm not saying I'm incapable! I could do this in my sleep!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Because it's easy.
>>> Man: <<<
What's happening here?!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Ninja.
>>>
2011-07-05 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Did you read my comments on the two alternatives?
>>> Boss: <<<
No.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I recommended option two because neither plan will work but option one is way more expensive.
>>> Boss: <<<
I already approved option one.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
If you need any more help, just let me know.
>>>
2011-07-04 * 
Man: <<<
You're ignorant and ridiculous. I'm bored. Are we done here?
>>> Boss: <<<
You're hired. You must have awesome technical skills or else someone would have killed you by now.
>>> Boss: <<<
I can't tell if I'm a management genius or just lazy.
>>>
2011-07-03 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Can you look at this bid and let me know if I can order the hardware?
>>> Boss: <<<
yes.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Are you saying yes I can order the hardware, or yes you'll look at it?
>>> Boss: <<<
Mumble mumble.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What?
>>> Boss: <<<
I need your input on my Powerpoint deck.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So far, in response to my request, you've given me ambiguity, mumbling, and a change of subject. Would you prefer that I badger you for an answer until you get angry, or should I return to my cubicle and resume being ineffective?
>>> Boss: <<<
You ask too many questions.
>>>
2011-07-02 * 
Woman: <<<
Let's begin the meeting, but be aware that I'm documenting all of your bullying behavior.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Um... I'm not even close to being a bully, but now your confirmation bias will make everything I say sound like bullying to you.
>>> Woman: <<<
Can you repeat the part after you implied that I'm a delusional witch?
>>>
2011-07-01 * 
Alice: <<<
I have been informed that it is politically incorrect to use my fist of death at work. So fell the wrath of my totally legal eye cannons!
>>> Noise: <<<
Budddabudda!!
>>> Asok: <<<
Gaa!!
>>> Alice: <<<
Oops. I didn't know you were single. Married guys can take a higher setting.
>>>
2011-06-30 * 
Carol: <<<
Check out my new smartphone! The voice receptions is a bit weak, but I can usually make a call if I keep my tongue on a flagpole.
>>> Alice: <<<
You might be a victim of good marketing.
>>> Carol: <<<
It has apps!
>>>
2011-06-29 * 
Carol: <<<
I need a new phone. Which one do you recommend?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Do you want to be angry about your dropped calls or angry about your poor battery life? Don't hate the messenger.
>>> Carol: <<<
People similar to you build phones.
>>>
2011-06-28 * 
Alice: <<<
It's impossible to get anything done this time of year because everyone who isn't totally worthless is on vacation.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
None taken.
>>>
2011-06-27 * 
CEO: <<<
Employees keep whining that we don't have a clear direction. So I've doubled the number of managers in each group to increase the clarity.
>>> Boss: <<<
I thought we were doubling the direction.
>>> CIO: <<<
No, we're doubling the clarity.
>>>
2011-06-26 * 
Alice: <<<
Steer clear of Darryl. He turned feral.
>>> Asok: <<<
Feral?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's what happens when engineers don't get invited to meetings.
>>> Alice: <<<
Darryl's only social life was meetings.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
He didn't get to use his social skills for a few weeks, and apparently he lost them.
>>> Asok: <<<
Is it like he turned into a wolfman?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Yes, except he's better at math. And he howls at the Internet, not the moon.
>>> Asok: <<<
Can we watch?
>>> Man: <<<
How-ooo can you blog that?
>>>
2011-06-25 * 
Catbert: <<<
Oh no! Employee job satisfaction is at an all-time low at the same time unemployment is high!
>>> Boss: <<<
Ha ha! Good one. Now it's my turn to try saying it as if I care! Oh no!
>>> Catbert: <<<
Ha ha! Fix your lips!
>>>
2011-06-24 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Google found out that we used fake links to boost our search rank. Now our website only shows up when someone enters the search string "dung for brains."
>>> Boss: <<<
They won't get away with this!
>>> Computer: <<<
Shut your pie hole.
>>>
2011-06-23 * 
Boss: <<<
I want you to use <<<
black hat" methods to raise our website's ranking on search engines.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What do you like best about that idea - the fact that it's unethical or the near certainty of getting caught?
>>> Boss: <<<
That's sort of a loserish thing to say.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Talking doesn't work for people like me.
>>>
2011-06-22 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I can't get buy-in for my project because our CEO hasn't approved it. And I can't get our CEO to approve it until I have buy-in from all of the divisions. On the plus side, now I understand why the windows in our building don't open.
>>> Boss: <<<
It's cleaner.
>>>
2011-06-21 * 
Boss: <<<
You'll need approval from the cloud.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
The cloud?
>>> Boss: <<<
It was once called Matrix Management. But it go so complicated that no one knows who does what.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Can you approve this?
>>> Man: <<<
What did everyone else say?
>>>
2011-06-20 * 
Dilbert: <<<
If you won the lottery, would you quit working?
>>> Wally: <<<
I quit working years ago, but I might start gloating if it isn't too hard.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Gloating doesn't sound hard.
>>> Wally: <<<
Can I do it without moving any facial muscles? I have weak eyebrows.
>>>
2011-06-19 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Do you have a minute?
>>> Boss: <<<
I'm on my way to a meeting. Follow me. We'll walk and talk.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I don't see how this can possibly work. You can barely concentrate when you're sitting perfectly still. When you add the extra complexity of walking, it's like asking a squirrel to land a 747.
>>> Boss: <<<
Must... prove underling... wrong...
>>> Noise: <<<
BONK!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I didn't know that being right could feel so good.
>>>
2011-06-18 * 
Asok: <<<
Wally, should I try to become indispensable so I won't be fired?
>>> Wally: <<<
No. Indispensable people end up working too hard because they can't risk showing anyone else how to do what they do.
>>> Asok: <<<
Being useless seems riskier.
>>> Wally: <<<
Have you seen the tie clip I got for 20 years of service?
>>>
2011-06-17 * 
Wally: <<<
I noticed some inefficiencies in another department, so I formed a Kaizen team to find solutions. I asked some of the peopl in that department to be on the team, but they were busy being inefficient. With any luck, my ignorance of their function will be seen as an aggressive type of objectivity.
>>>
2011-06-16 * 
Boss: <<<
Wally, have you done anything to address of your project with Ted's project?
>>> Wally: <<<
Yes, I've initiated discussions to create a framework that would allow us to adopt complementary architectures.
>>> Boss: <<<
So... nothing.
>>> Wally: <<<
When did we stop calling it leadership?
>>>
2011-06-15 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Um... may I ask one...
>>> Man: <<<
Blah, blah, blah, blah...
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm begging you. Let me ask...
>>> Man: <<<
Blah, blah, blah, blah...
>>> Boss: <<<
You need to participate more in meetings.
>>>
2011-06-14 * 
Man: <<<
Your idea will never work.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
At what point did you reject the hypothesis that you're too dumb to understand how good the idea is? I'm becoming even less of a people person.
>>>
2011-06-13 * 
Asok: <<<
I am unfulfilled at my job. When does that feeling go away?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Asok, you shouldn't think you're totally worthless.
>>> Asok: <<<
Um... I didn't say I was worthless.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm trying to take your mind off of the other thing.
>>>
2011-06-12 * 
Boss: <<<
Did you ask the lab if they have a way to test traffic loads on our prototype?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I met with them for an hour and explained that we need traffic load tests.
>>> Boss: <<<
But you didn't actually ask if they could do the tests?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Well... no... but... it's their job to do the tests. And they would have mentioned it if they didn't have a way to do it.
>>> Boss: <<<
But you didn't ask.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That was the context of the meeting. If they couldn't do that sort of test they would have mentioned it sometime during our hour together.
>>> Boss: <<<
Maybe you should ask.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Gaa!! Okay! I'll ask! Are you freakin' kidding me?!!
>>> Man: <<<
I wondered why you didn't ask.
>>>
2011-06-11 * 
Asok: <<<
I can't wait to finish this mind-numbing task... so I can start another mind-numbing task. I really need to stop thinking.
>>>
2011-06-10 * 
Alice: <<<
I'm just stopping by to say you're doing a great job, Alice.
>>> Alice: <<<
You never do that! It's a trick! Die, monster, die!
>>> Boss: <<<
I might have a credibility issue.
>>>
2011-06-09 * 
Wally: <<<
This week I renamed all of the Unix servers to make them easier to remember. In phase one, the new names exist only in my mind. I won't know if they're easy to remember until next week.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
How are the new server names?
>>> Wally: <<<
I don't know what you're talking about. Next week.
>>>
2011-06-08 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I invented a shoulder holder for my phone. I felt bad keeping my best friend in my pocket. Jealousy in not attractive.
>>>
2011-06-07 * 
Man: <<<
My financial model in Excel is so complicated that I assume it's riddled with formula errors. But that's okay because management only uses the results when the figures support their schemes for career advancement. Uh-oh. I just realized that my life is ridiculous.
>>> Boss: <<<
Do you have hand-outs?
>>>
2011-06-06 * 
Boss: <<<
I'll review your document and give you my comments this afternoon.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
No you won't. You'll read one paragraph then tell me to go research something so you can postpone dealing with it.
>>> Boss: <<<
They know about Plan <<<
A.
>>>
2011-06-05 * 
Alice: <<<
Seriously? You're going to do email while I give my status update?
>>> Boss: <<<
Don't worry. I can multitask.
>>> Alice: <<<
Multitask? you can barely do one task properly. All you're doing is doubling your rate of failure. Congratulations on becoming the most useless blob of carbon in the universe.
>>> Boss: <<<
What? Sorry. I missed that.
>>> Alice: <<<
I said my project is on schedule.
>>> Boss: <<<
Okay. Great.
>>> Alice: <<<
This totally works for me.
>>>
2011-06-04 * 
Boss: <<<
Tina, all I wanted you to say in the press release is that our VP of engineering is leaving for personal reasons. You didn't need to speculate on the reasons. Let's lost the part about "Bieber Fever."
>>> Tina: <<<
Everyone thinks it's easy to write fiction.
>>>
2011-06-03 * 
Man: <<<
How can you compare outsourcing to our restrooms? Are you a racist?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Um... I didn't say anything remotely like that. Did you learn to debate on the Internet?
>>> Man: <<<
How can you tell?
>>>
2011-06-02 * 
CEO: <<<
According to your absurdly complicated financial model, we can double revenue by increasing absenteeism.
>>> Fred: <<<
To be fair, there might be an error or two in the Excel spreadsheet.
>>> CEO: <<<
Maybe, but I think I owe it to our stockholders to poison the cafeteria just to be sure.
>>>
2011-06-01 * 
Weasel: <<<
Do you remember six months ago when I told you you were wrong? Eee-yore! Eee-yore! Eee-yore! I just realized I'm a bad winner.
>>>
2011-05-31 * 
Boss: <<<
The company is considering moving from cubicles to an open workspace environment.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Great idea. Can we add some crying babies and the sound of water dripping?
>>> Boss: <<<
You're being stupid.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Maybe I'll be smarter when I have more distractions.
>>>
2011-05-30 * 
Wally: <<<
I can't work for a boss who doesn't trust me to work independently!
>>> Boss: <<<
Is this a preemptive strike so I won't ask why you didn't turn in a project update?
>>> Wally: <<<
And more distrust. How do you live with yourself?
>>>
2011-05-29 * 
Boss: <<<
This award goes to Dilbert for coming up with a major fix to our HTML.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I didn't do anything like that. You must be thinking of someone else. Do you even know what HTML is?
>>> Boss: <<<
It's like... a website?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So... you're giving an award for something you don't understand... to someone who wasn't involved?
>>> Boss: <<<
What I meant to say is that I give this award to... Alice... for... what she did.
>>> Alice: <<<
Yes! Envy me, you stinkin' losers!
>>> Boss: <<<
I don't know why people say this improves morale.
>>> Asok: <<<
I fixed the HTML!
>>>
2011-05-28 * 
Boss: <<<
Hackers got through our firewall.
>>> CEO: <<<
Launch escape pod!
>>> Two questions: <<<
What is a firewall? And who designed my escape pod?
>>>
2011-05-27 * 
Boss: <<<
Security says your employee locator device isn't turned on.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
My what?
>>> Boss: <<<
I think you call it your smartphone.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I might have some questions.
>>> Boss: <<<
Put them in a text to yourself. I'll read them later.
>>>
2011-05-26 * 
Dogbert: <<<
Today you'll learn how to work independently. In this exercise, I want you to put your arms at you side, close your eyes, and fall backward.
>>> Noise: <<<
Thud thud thud.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
And it's still better than working with other people.
>>>
2011-05-25 * 
Woman: <<<
I used to compare all men to my ex-boyfriend. Now I compare all men to the entertainment standard of my smartphone.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I only scored a two on the smartphone scale, but I was a solid five compared to someone named <<<
lying Larry.
>>>
2011-05-24 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Our firewall is down. Some bad stuff is getting through.
>>> Boss: <<<
How bad?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So far we've seen viruses, spyware, tuberculosis, zombies, a deposed dictator, and an iPhone 3GS.
>>> Update: <<<
an army of mole people from another dimension has tunneled through.
>>> Boss: <<<
Keep me informed.
>>>
2011-05-23 * 
Boss: <<<
Mordac, I'm not getting the coupons by email that I signed up for. Can you dial back the firewall or something?
>>> Mordac: <<<
Absolutely. There's nothing I enjoy more than malicious compliance with your requests.
>>> Boss: <<<
Is there any downside?
>>> Mordac: <<<
UNLEASH THE DOGS OF HELL!
>>>
2011-05-22 * 
Boss: <<<
This doesn't feel right.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It came straight from our lawyer.
>>> Boss: <<<
It just feels wrong. Can you research it a little more?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Sure. I can do that research in my head. Let's see... our lawyer got his degree at Harvard and has twenty years in this exact field. Whereas you have a "feeling" that is probably the result of an unholy combination of greasy food and ignorance. The data clearly favors the Harvard Law degree over the cheeseburger. ... Good luck. He's in a bad mood.
>>>
2011-05-21 * 
Dilbert: <<<
There was a consensus in the room that you're not important, so we started without you. We hate you for disrespecting us with your lateness and we expect you'll be lost and confused by the rest of this meeting.
>>> Anne: <<<
In summary, lateness is one of those things that doesn't work for everyone.
>>>
2011-05-20 * 
Boss: <<<
I no longer understand anything my employees say. I must be so out of touch with technology that I don't even recognize the words.
>>> Wally: <<<
I flushed the gravitons out of the warp drive and rebalanced the subspace responders.

Dilbert: <<<
I'm considering becoming an idiot so I can get the health benefits of happiness. It comes with a social stigma, but that's not a problem if I'm not aware that I'm an idiot. I feel healthy today, so there's a good chance I already made the transition.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
Yep.
>>>
2011-05-17 * 
Dilbert: <<<
You scheduled the end of the test phase after the start of the production phase.
>>> CIO: <<<
We're feeling confident.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It's too bad that being smart doesn't come with some sort of good feeling like that.
>>>
2011-05-16 * 
Boss: <<<
Did I remember to tell you before you finished the coding that the user's specifications changed?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
AAAIII-YIIIII-YIIII-YIII!!!
>>> Boss: <<<
So, no-ish?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
BAM! BAM! BAM!
>>>
2011-05-15 * 
Waiter: <<<
Would you mind filling out this customer survey so we know how we're doing?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I don't have time to fill out surveys about everything I do. But you're making me feel guilty about not doing it. Oh no! You turned a good customer experience into something ugly. It's getting all awkward and I'm looking like a big jerk in front my date. Now I can never again eat here because I'm afraid of what you'll do to my food. You've ruined my favorite restaurant, as well as my chance of romance with this woman.
>>> Waiter: <<<
... favorite restaurant...
>>> Woman: <<<
What are you doing later?
>>>
2011-05-14 * 
Dogbert: <<<
I took the liberty of updating your estate plan.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
This gives you a powerful incentive to kill me so you can inherit my stuff.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
If it makes you feel any better, that option has always been on the table.
>>>
2011-05-13 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I estimated the project timeline by assuming that everyone involved will waste one week.
>>> Boss: <<<
That's a stupid way to do a timeline. Set up a meeting and I'll show you how it's supposed to be done.
>>> Carol: <<<
He's available in a week.
>>>
2011-05-12 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I'm sick of listening to whiny idiots. Do you have a pill for that?
>>> Doctor: <<<
I sure do! I took a handful of them this morning and I feel great in spite of your complaining! How funny would it be if I make you run on a treadmill until you pass out?
>>>
2011-05-11 * 
Boss: <<<
Wally, did you finish coding the paywall for our website?
>>> Wally: <<<
I did something better. I wrote a script to delete any new content as soon as it's posted. At bonus time, keep in mind that you're the one who had the idea to eliminate revenue, and I'm the one who lowered hosting costs.
>>>
2011-05-10 * 
Ted: <<<
For competitive reasons, we've rebranded all of our 4G mobile products as 8G.

I'm curious what the marketing department thinks the "G" stands for.

Guess what doesn't mean <<<
goodness.

Dogbert: <<<
Here's the first draft of an advance health care directive I wrote for you.

"Kill me if I have a headache. Kill me if I'm itchy. Kill me if I complain too much.

There's your complaining again!

2011-05-08 * 
Dilbert: <<<
In my spare time I created some awesome new features for our product.
>>> Boss: <<<
GAAA!!! Shut the door!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What?!!
>>> Boss: <<<
You fool! If my boss finds out you have spare time, he'll think we're overstaffed! You can never speak of these awesome new features again.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I'm confused. You told me I need to go above and beyond my job description to get the highest performance rating.
>>> Boss: <<<
That's just something I say to keep you from getting a healthy raise.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
So... I lose no matter what I do?
>>> Boss: <<<
For what it's worth, you're doing better than our customers.
>>>
2011-05-07 * 
Dinosaur: <<<
I need the signed original contract to process your order.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Because we're in the Middle Ages?
>>> Dinosaur: <<<
Ouch! Your stinging sarcasm has embarrassed me into saying I will accept a faxed copy. Are we good now?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Absolutely. Because the 1950s is a happy time. Bob In Procurement

Wally: <<<
I'm toying with the idea of becoming a useful member of society. Then I could enjoy the admiration and respect of my peers.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
The way you respect and admire me?
>>> Wally: <<<
Great! Now you've talked me out of it!
>>>
2011-05-05 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Congratulations on solving every important problem in the world. I assume that's what happened. Otherwise, you wouldn't have time to create desk standardization policies. High five?

Carol: <<<
Once again, our only profitable line of business is <<<
intentional billing errors.
>>> It started as a series of honest mistakes. Now it's the only way we can maintain our bonuses.

Mordac: <<<
Ted, the I.S. group monitors every website you visit. Based on that information, we came up with a list of nicknames for you. My job got a lot more fun after we stopped doing the client satisfaction surveys. Mordac

Dilbert: <<<
My brain isn't working at its peak efficiency this afternoon. Common sense says I should go home early to avoid making any mistakes that would be bad for the company. Unless... nothing I... do is important.
>>> Boss: <<<
Sounds like your brain is back to its peak efficiency.
>>>
2011-05-01 * 
Boss: <<<
Who wants to see a picture of my new boat?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's a very good question. If we consider the fact that we work much harder than he does...
>>> Carol: <<<
And we have valuable engineering skills, whereas he can't operate the GPS in his SUV... and for some reason we don't get paid enough to buy impressive boats.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
And we have no nautical interests whatsoever. I think your best bet is people who don't know you.
>>> Man: <<<
And you are?
>>> Boss: <<<
This only works if we don't get too familiar.
>>>
2011-04-30 * 
Dogbert: <<<
I researched how long your customers will stay on the phone trying to get tech support before giving up. Then I designed an audio menu tree that will take them slightly longer than that to reach your tech support. I've seen your user manuals and I assume that you hate your customers' guts.
>>> Boss: <<<
It's more of an apathy thing.

2011-04-29 * 
Dogbert: <<<
Are you trying to recover a password, PIN code, user name, pass code or code word?
>>> Man: <<<
I hate this stupid complicated planet! I am so out of here! Dogbert's password recovery service. And that is how Floyd became the first person to hold his breath and jump into outer space.
>>>
2011-04-28 * 
Ted: <<<
I have so many passwords and email accounts and user names that I don't know what goes to what. I'm lost. If you can't help me I think I might snap.

No problem. What's your password recovery PIN code?
>>> Noise: <<<
SNAP! Dogbert's password recovery service.

The company is trying to reduce expenses, so you need to pay for your own radiation dosimeters.

Still nothing. One hour later

Carol: <<<
I'm in a bad mood. Maybe I need some sun to boost my vitamin D level.
>>> Topper: <<<
That's nothing. Exposure to my inner glow will give you a full range of vitamins and minerals.

You're better than the sun?
>>> Topper: <<<
I don't quit just because it's night. Topper.

2011-04-24 * 
Boss: <<<
The first thing on the agenda...
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Hold on. I don't know anything about this guy.
>>> Boss: <<<
What's the difference?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I need to know how important he is. Should I pretend to like his jokes? Should I nod in agreement no matter what he says?
>>> Man: <<<
You can call me anything. Just don't call me late for dinner.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Ha ha ha ha ha!! I hope I didn't waste that.

2011-04-23 * 
Ted: <<<
The committee decided that the file naming convention will start with the date, in the order of month, year, day... then a space, then the temperature at the airport, and the hat size of the nearest squirrel. To be perfectly honest, it was a long meeting and we probably didn't do our best work toward the end.
>>>
2011-04-22 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Asok, there's no nice way to say this... do this mindless task for me because you're nothing but an intern and your time has very little value.
>>> Asok: <<<
There probably was a nice way to say that.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
It didn't jump out.
>>>
2011-04-21 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Do you mind if I ask Carol to help me schedule these meetings?
>>> Boss: <<<
Ooh... that's no good. She'd use it as an excuse to do absolutely nothing else for a week.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is it okay if I just stare at you in disbelief?
>>> Boss: <<<
Shouldn't you be scheduling some meetings?
>>>
2011-04-20 * 
Dilbert: <<<
I hope I'm not calling too late. What time is it in Elbonia?
>>> Elbonian: <<<
We're seventy years in your future. I'm the great grandson of the guy you are trying to reach. By the way, that SETI thing won't work out the way you're hoping.

Boss: <<<
Which one of you asked for capital for testing handset radiation?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That was Stan. And you told him to find a less expensive way to do it.
>>> Boss: <<<
Which one of you is Stan?
>>>
2011-04-18 * 
Boss: <<<
Low-hanging fruit! OW!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
See?
>>> Wally: <<<
Wow.
>>>
2011-04-17 * 
Boss: <<<
And we plan to bestshore the production.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
What?
>>> Boss: <<<
We say bestshore now instead of offshore.
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Is that because we never tried to pick the best shore until now?
>>> Boss: <<<
Of course we tried to pick the best shore!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
But we never succeeded because we're incompetent?
>>> Boss: <<<
All I'm saying is that some countries are better than others!
>>> Wally: <<<
We're racists?
>>>
2011-04-16 * 
Ted: <<<
I developed this app in my spare time. What do you think?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
I think you made spare time look like an awful thing. If you'd like a less honest answer, I can recommend someone in marketing.
>>> Ted: <<<
I might try that.

2011-04-15 * 
CEO: <<<
I'm adding a few layers of management below me. The new layers are VP, AVP, Director, dolphin, inanimate object, and chalky substance. If you have any issue, I encourage you to talk to the chalky substance.
>>>
2011-04-14 * 
CEO: <<<
I plant to add seven more layers of management between you and me. My goal is to lead the company without knowing anything about it.
>>> Boss: <<<
That sounds like a bad idea.
>>> CEO: <<<
This sort of input is exactly what I'm trying to avoid.
>>>
2011-04-13 * 
Dilbert: <<<
Our products only appeal to people who aren't good at comparison shopping. But I justify it because our existence prevents competitors from raising prices. Am I a bad person?
>>> Dogbert: <<<
I molt a little bit every time you talk.
>>>
2011-04-12 * 
Dogbert: <<<
Our new product will be a social network for people who want to be friends with ghosts. We'll post satellite pictures on each ghost's personal page and say the photos were taken from heaven.
>>> Man: <<<
Abraham Lincoln posted new pictures.
>>> Woman: <<<
I'm chatting with Gandhi! Later.
>>>
2011-04-11 * 
Dogbert: <<<
You need to create a product that gives people the illusion of being friends with ghosts.
>>> Boss: <<<
People only want real friends, not imaginary ones. Your idea is ridiculous.
>>> Dogbert: <<<
How many friends do you have on Facebook?
>>> Boss: <<<
Seven hundred. Why?

Voice: <<<
Meltdown in cubicle 459540!
>>> Dilbert: <<<
That's Te. He must have reached his T.W.L.
>>> Asok: <<<
His what?
>>> Dilbert: <<<
Theoretical workload limit. In layman's terms, his brain is full. It starts when just one of your projects becomes overdue. You end up spending all of your time explaining why you didn't get it done. That makes all of your other projects overdue. When ever task become urgent, your brain can't decide what to do next. Brains make a funny noise when they shut down.
>>> Noise: <<<
Poink.
>>> Asok: <<<
Uh-oh. I just missed a deadline.
>>> Wally: <<<
And so it begins.
>>>
2011-04-09 * 
Asok says, <<<
I created a portal to a parallel universe. My success was possible because Alice killed our boss so we are all more productive.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Step aside. The cops have been sniffing around and I need something from the other universe.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Look on the bright side, Asok. Some other universe just got a lot more productive.
>>>
2011-04-08 * 
Police says, <<<
We have a report of a pointy-haired boss being stunned by data overload, stuffed, and used as a hand puppet.
>>> Alice says, <<<
That's ridiculous. It sounds like the plot of a poorly written story arc.
>>> Police says, <<<
It sounds poorly drawn too.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Case closed, right?
>>>
2011-04-07 * 
Man says, <<<
The engineering department is finishing all of their projects early and we don't know why.
>>> CEO says, <<<
Tell them to do a powerpoint presentation at the next executive retreat to share their methods.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Now it's my turn to use the dead boss hand puppet!
>>> Alice says, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>>
2011-04-06 * 
Alice says, <<<
His brain shut down from information overload, so I asked a libertarian taxidermist to stuff him.
>>> Alice says, <<<
There's a hand hole in the back so we can work him like a puppet.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's sort of creepy.
>>> Alice says, <<<
You'll get used to it.
>>>
2011-04-05 * 
Alice says, <<<
I'd like a quote for taxidermy on this critter.
>>> Man says, <<<
The law says I can't stuff humans, especially when they're still breathing.
>>> Man says, <<<
But I believe in small government, so roll him to the back.
>>>
2011-04-04 * 
Alice says, <<<
Now you've done it. He has brain overload from your unnecessarily detailed answer.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Great. He's totally broken and we need a decision today.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Is he nodding yes?
>>> Alice says, <<<
I'm sensing an opportunity here.

Dogbert says, <<<
I don't like people.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
What makes your company so profitable?
>>> CEO says, <<<
I give all of the credit to our fine employees.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Is that another way of saying you're overpaid and useless?
>>> CEO says, <<<
Um... no. I'm their leader. I set the direction.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Because the employees are too dumb to set their own direction?
>>> CEO says, <<<
No! They're smart!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
But not as smart as you?
>>> CEO says, <<<
Who's going to see this?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
No one, assuming you're the highest bidder.

I know.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Your communication skill are so poor that I gave up trying to understand what you wanted and instead put some random numbers on a spreadsheet.
>>> Woman says, <<<
Why didn't you just ask me to clarify?!

Apparently your listening skills need work too.

2011-03-31 * 
Press Conference Dogbert says, <<<
As you can clearly see, I have created cold fusion.
>>> Man says, <<<
That's not cold fusion. It's just a jar with a lightbulb.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Here's some more news: No one cares what the camera guy thinks.
>>> Woman says, <<<
It's free energy!
>>>
2011-03-30 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
I'm ready to hold a press conference to introduce my cold fusion breakthrough.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
All you did is put a lightbulb in a jar. I can see the wires plugged into the outlet.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You have a low opinion of people.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I considered using a jar with frosted glass, but it seemed like overkill.
>>>
2011-03-29 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
I'm writing fake press releases for imaginary new green energy technologies.
>>> Computer says, <<<
Scientists say that by 2040 you will be able to power your entire home with the breeze from your refrigerator door.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Now how will I know which green breakthroughs are real?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Seriously? You think there are real ones?
>>>
2011-03-28 * 
Asok says, <<<
To answer your question faster, I'll need to use the two halves of my brain like dual core processors.
>>> Asok says, <<<
I'm only warning you because it might be disconcerting to watch.
>>> Woman says, <<<
How bad could it be?
>>> Asok says, <<<
Wah-ah-geeee!
>>> Woman says, <<<
Maybe you can e-mail me your answer.
>>>
2011-03-27 * 
Woman says, <<<
Wally, can you review this for any engineering issues?
>>> Wally says, <<<
What issues do you think it has?
>>> Woman says, <<<
I don't know. I'm not an engineer.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Your request is too vague. You need to tell me what issues I'm looking for!
>>> Woman says, <<<
Did you just ask me to do what I just asked you to do?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I don't know. I'm an engineer, not a linguist.
>>> Woman says, <<<
I've suddenly lost all faith in humanity!
>>> Wally says, <<<
On the plus side, you found an issue.
>>>
2011-03-26 * 
Carol says, <<<
Hey, Asok. I'm updating our employee profiles. Where'd you go to school?
>>> Asok says, <<<
I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology in Lucknow with a double major in engineering and physics, and a minor in false humility.
>>> Asok says, <<<
For my combined thesis I terraformed a planet in another dimension and didn't tell anyone.
>>> Carol says, <<<
I'll put 'Indian.'
>>>
2011-03-25 * 
The Boss says, <<<
We can learn from our mistakes. Let's make a list of the things that each of you did wrong this year.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It is just a coincidence that our annual performance reviews are due next week?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It would have been the stuff of management legends.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Very nice try.
>>>
2011-03-24 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I spent the week writing a test script for our product.
>>> Wally says, <<<
And I wrote a test script to test Dilbert's test script.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Your script was almost perfect. Keep up the good work, buddy.
>>>
2011-03-23 * 
Catbert says, <<<
We're no longer using the term 'work-life balance' because it implies that your life is important.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Now we call it 'work-life integration' so it's easier to make you work when you would prefer being with loved ones.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
And I'd like to give a big thanks to those of you who never had a life.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You're welcome.
>>>
2011-03-22 * 
Alice says, <<<
I'm filling in for your boss this week, and I need twenty copies.

That's not how it works. When he's out of the office I take a workstation vacation.
>>> Alice says, <<<
I don't like being in charge.
>>> Carol says, <<<
I hear it's overrated.

2011-03-20 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Asok, get me the reliability stats for our previous model.
>>> Asok says, <<<
I am fairly certain the data does not exist.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Wally can show you how to get it.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Come with me.
>>> Wally says, <<<
You start by typing random numbers into a spreadsheet.
>>> Asok says,"Then what?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Then you're done.
>>> Wally says, <<<
All business data is intentionally misleading. I just take it to the next level.
>>> Wally says, <<<
A deep understanding of reality is exactly the same thing as laziness.
>>> Asok says, <<<
That can't be right.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Have you ever seen a statue of Buddha jogging?
>>>
2011-03-19 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Alice, I need you to fill in for me while I'm on vacation.
>>> Alice says, <<<
I can't wait to belittle my subordinates for not doing the things I only imagined telling them to do.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Why would you do that?
>>> Alice says, <<<
Why would you ask that?
>>>
2011-03-18 * 
Coworker says, <<<
Why haven't you returned my calls?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I tried, but when I put the phone to my ear, it pressed my tragus over my ear hole and I couldn't hear a thing.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Do you do research on your excuses before meetings?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm not lazy, I'm useless. There's a big difference.

2011-03-17 * 
Tina says, <<<
My best friend from college keeps bugging me to visit her. The flight will cost a small fortune.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Try offering her a cash payment of half the estimated cost of the trip if she agrees to stop inviting you.

You don't have any friends, do you?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I hear they're expensive.

Scientists say that exercise makes your brain work better.

I haven't exercised since the eighties.

That pretty much debunks science.

It had a good run.

2011-03-15 * 
Coworker says, <<<
I thought of your idea a year ago and rejected it for being impractical.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Did you just take credit for my idea and diss it at the same time?
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Thanks for noticing.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
He also cleverly implied that you're a moron.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
It feels good to be appreciated!
>>>
2011-03-14 * 

2011-03-13 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I can't sign off on this plan. It's too expensive.
>>> Man says, <<<
You heard me say that doing nothing will end up costing you twice as much, right?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Yes.
>>> Man says, <<<
And you understand that this is your only alternative?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I have another meeting. Maybe Dilbert can explain it to you.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Um... okay. I'll try.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
My boss doesn't understand that costs should be compared to alternatives.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Oh.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Teamwork means you can't pick the side that's right.
>>>
2011-03-12 * 
Wally says, <<<
I can't help you because I'm busy working on a social network strategy for our global supply chain.
>>> Man says, <<<
That sounds like something that no one wants and no one needs.
>>> Wally says, <<<
That's probably why it's taking so long.
>>>
2011-03-11 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
You competitors are faster because they have meetings where everyone has to stand up.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
We'll top that by having meetings where everyone does jumping jacks while I pelt them with office supplies.
>>> Asok says, <<<
It's working!
>>>
2011-03-10 * 

2011-03-09 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I need you to be open-minded about this idea.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Oh, really?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
That's the sort of thing people say before they describe the worst idea in the history of the world.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
My idea is to not give me a raise.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'm hating you a little extra.
>>>
2011-03-08 * 
Wally says, <<<
I considered getting an earring to make myself more fascinating.
>>> Wally says, <<<
But I spend a lot of time sleeping in my chair, so I need my head to be center balanced.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You don't have normal problems.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I almost died getting my hair cut.
>>>
2011-03-07 * 
Wally says, <<<
What happened to you?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I went to a technology trade show.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The event was so huge that it made me feel small. But it's just an illusion.
>>> Wally says, <<<
For an illusion, you make a great cup holder.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Dude. Not cool.
>>>
2011-03-06 * 
The Boss says, <<<
You need to be more proactive.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I can only appear to be proactive if you stop telling me to do things I've already planned.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
How am I supposed to know what you plan to do every minute?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I could send you an e-mail every time I have a thought.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I don't have time for that!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Apparently your bad time management is creating the illusion that I'm not proactive.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll take the liberty of signing you up for a time management class.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Don't do that!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So...I should not be proactive?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Just do what I want before I know I want it.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I hope the next thing you want is sarcasm.

You use a what?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Do you have any free stuff or job offers?
>>> At the trade show
2011-03-04 *

I see you have your giant-sized barf bag. You must be going to the consumer electronics show.

Yup.

Every time I see a new product that is cooler than anything we're working on, I'll go to the bag.

2011-03-02 * 
Wally sys, <<<
Should I continue to manage issues?

Or should I align organizational activities with stakeholder expectations?

Which answer would cause you to do real work?

If the only part that goes wrong is the Chinese part, you can try dying again.

The Boss says, <<<
Build a new server to replace the one with the corrupt operating system.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's what I'm doing right now.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Recover the data from the bad server and put it on the new one.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's the whole point.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Then see if you can reinstall the operating system on the old one and redeploy it.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Do you have any instructions that are not blindingly obvious?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
This is called managing. The alternative is chaos.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
How did you just make chaos sound like a good thing?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You should test the new server.

Seriously, can we try the chaos thing?

Well, at least I can save lives.
>>> Carol says, <<<
He said something about his cat's birthday.
>>>
2011-02-23 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Your software services contract is too confusing for any normal human to comprehend.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
And it wouldn't be cost- effective to involve our attorneys for a deal so small.

I'll be competing against all of the other departments for precious budget dollars.

This won't be easy because all of the other departments are staffed with professional liars.

That's a bit of an exaggeration, don't you think?

Okay, I'll give you that one.

Less micro-management?

No, I'll have to watch you more closely than ever to make sure you're doing mroe with less.

I'm talking about using less money.

Oh, like a death spiral. Why didn't you just say that in the first place?

You?
>>> Topper says, <<<
Wrong! It's turtles all the way down. But who do you think is holding the infinite turtles?

The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, work with Gustav to get our new product explained on our website.
>>> Gustav says, <<<
Here's what I have so far.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's awful.
>>> Gustav says, <<<
Excuse me?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
There's no information. It's all images and annoying music.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
People make buying decisions based on what they read. This gives them nothing.
>>> Gustav says, <<<
If I clutter the design with useful information, it will look ugly, and I won't be able to use it in my portfolio.
>>> Gustav says, <<<
I need that portfolio to get a job at a better company. Please help me escape.
>>> Gustav says, <<<
You'll probably work here until you die in your dubicle no matter what the website looks like.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Did you help Gustav?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Yes, but it wasn't a good day for our stock holders.
>>>
2011-02-05 * 
Man says, <<<
There is a very simple solution to the problem that is stumping Dilbert.
>>> Man says, <<<
I will gladly explain it to him after this meeting.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You're probably wrong, and yet you still made me look like an idiot.
>>> Man says, <<<
I win!
>>>
2011-02-04 * 
The Boss says, <<<
The government's new unemployment statistics are out.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's still a bad time to look for a job.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Yeah. I got that.
>>>
2011-02-03 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
If we build our software with no bugs, we can make a 10% return on our investment.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But if we do a poor job, we can make a 40% return by selling upgrades and service.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But don't worry. We only have the budget for a poor job.
>>> CEO says, <<<
I can't remember if we're cheap or smart.
>>> Boss says, <<<
Phew!

Alice says, <<<
Is this how you really write, or did birds walk on your keyboard?
>>> Alice says, <<<
I only need your opinion on the technical part of it.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Okay, let's assume that your readers will know what you mean by 'blobbing on the ethernet.'
>>>
2011-01-31 * 
Asok says, <<<
I thought my Elbonian kidnappers would hold me forever because you refused to pay the ransom.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Then the Stockholm effect kicked in. I started identifying with my captors and beating myself.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
And they let you go?
>>> Asok says, <<<
Apparently it looked contagious.
>>>
2011-01-30 * 
Woman says, <<<
Dilbert, your boss asked me to get your input on this.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Absolutely, Ruth.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
We have two options for wasting our time here.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Option one: I could tell you all of the things you should change, and you could ignore me as usual.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Option two: I could lie, and tell you that everything is perfect.
>>> Woman says, <<<
I prefer the lie. That way I can pin some blame on you if things go bad.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Excellent choice. It's faster, and I can later say I was misinterpreted.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Okay then, I declare that your document is perfect, under a certain set of assumptions that I won't list.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Did you help Ruth?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll say yes, but it's sort of a gray area.
>>>
2011-01-29 * 
Carol says, <<<
Elbonian leftists kidnapped Asok. They have ransom demands.
>>> Carol says, <<<
They want a three-pack of tube socks, a carton of milk, and six yams.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Maybe you could buy that stuff on your way home.
>>> Carol says, <<<
You're making my life a nightmare! Just keep him!
>>>

Airport Security Man says, <<<
Step over here, sleeper cell.
>>> Man says, <<<
Our new pat down procedures might be more invasive than you're used to.
>>> Man says, <<<
Only terrorists act nervous in these situations.
>>> Airport Security
2011-01-27 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Asok, I need you to go to Elbonia. It's too cold for airplanes to operate there, so you'll need to use the underground route.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Fly into Switzerland and follow the sewer systems from there. Stick to the side of the sewer where it's dryer.
>>> Asok says, <<<
It's a sewerside mission!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You'll need a warm jacket and a rat hammer.
>>>
2011-01-26 * 
The Boss says, <<<
We've decided to use the new tax incentives on the projects we were going to do anyway.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The tax savings will go toward executive bonuses, which stimulate the economy via the 'trickle on your heads' theory.
>>> Alice says, <<<
It's called the 'trickle down' theory.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Not on poker night.
>>>
2011-01-25 * 
Demon says, <<<
The government announced tax incentives for new capital investments.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's great. Now we can pursue marginally attractive opportunities with our overburdened staff.
>>> Demon says, <<<
Is he always like this?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Yes.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll just divert resources from our top priorities.
>>>
2011-01-24 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Why did you reject my friend request on Facebook?
>>> Carol says, <<<
I'm not your friend. I'm a disgruntled wage slave who hopes you die in a freak industrial accident tomorrow at 3PM.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
That's disturbingly specific.
>>> Carol says, <<<
Hey, look. You have a meeting at the warehouse tomorrow.
>>>
2011-01-23 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, this is Alan. He's a frendor.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
He's not just a friend, and not just a vendor. He's something in between.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
He'll laugh at your jokes and invite you to golf.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Some people are bothered by this conditional type of 'affection.'
>>> The Boss says, <<<
But it's better than the nothing you have now.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
This is awkward because I already decided to buy from his competition.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Now you've done it. You turned your frendor into a stalkor.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I wonder if it's wrong to enjoy the attention.
>>>
2011-01-22 * 
Alice says, <<<
I just saw in the news that Google gave an engineer millions of dollars. I'm underpaid!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'll speak to our director of human resources and see how I can fix this situation.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Really?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
How can we stop news?
>>>
2011-01-21 * 
The Boss says, <<<
We're not creative enough to create whole new markets, the way apple does.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
And we're not powerful enough for a fast follower strategy.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
What we need is a sexy, strategic-sounding name for crumb-snatching.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Niche player?
>>>
2011-01-20 * 
Wally says, <<<
How did your interview go yesterday?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Great!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
They offered less money for a worse job. But for half a day I imagined it would be better.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Half a day/! Lucky!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I know! I can't wait for my next useless interview!
>>>
2011-01-19 * 
Man says, <<<
Thanks for spending the day itnerviewing with us. I can now reveal the vature of the job and the salary range.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You know my current salary and yet you wasted my entire day interviewing me for a job that pays less. You are either evil or inconsiderate.
>>> Man says, <<<
So... not as good as your current job?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's a tie. I'll need to test the commute one more time.
>>>
2011-01-18 * 
Dogbert's Sales Training Seminar Dogbert says, <<<
Losers sell to customers.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Winners sell the idea of low quota levels to their own bosses.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Now everyone do the cha-ching dance!
>>> Dogbert's Sales Training Seminar
2011-01-17 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I have a great idea! Why don't we make our product social?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Because when you start to understand a concept, it marks the beginning of its decline.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
On a related note, it's never a good idea to ask an engineer a question in the 'why don't we' format.
>>>
2011-01-16 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Our meeting room is being used by a vice president.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I need all of you to search for an unoccupied room. Call my cell when you find one.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'll stay here in case they finish soon.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Where are you going to look?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm going to take a nap in my cubicle and hope the problem takes care of itself.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Good idea. I'll go get some work done.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Perfect time to run some errands.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Optimism is a lot like disappointment.
>>>
2011-01-15 * 
The Boss says, <<<
How's everything going?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It couldn't be worse.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I was the only person who said this project is a bad idea. Then you assigned it to me.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's funnier when I make them say it.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Grrrr
>>>
2011-01-14 * 
Coworker says, <<<
Your idea has already been tried by others and it failed miserably.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Were those other as skilled at implementing ideas as you are at evaluating them?
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Of course they were!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Can you tell him to stop insulting himself?
>>>
2011-01-13 * 
Tina says, <<<
Did you hear that Dilbert and Alice are on the same Pon Farr cycle?
>>> Carol says, <<<
What?
>>> Tina says, <<<
Every seven years, engineers have an irresistible urge to mate. Their spawn would be the product of two engineers.
>>> There's a reason it rarely happens Dilbert says, <<<
Your plan has unnecessary steps!
>>> Alice says, <<<
Your specifications are vague!
>>>

2011-01-11 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I can't stop voicing my honest opinions. It's causing problems at work.
>>> Doctor says, <<<
According to your medical records, you're an engineer. We classify that as a disease now.
>>> Man says, <<<
Gaaa!!! You haven't had your pon farr vaccination.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Is it warm in here?
>>>
2011-01-10 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
In this country, it is customary to respond to a question with somehting called an 'answer.'
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Your approach is more like what I would expect to see if clothing were used as bags for meat.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Now I will ask my question a seventh time...
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Stop saying what you're thinking.

The Boss says, <<<
I hired a consultant to help us evolve our products to cloud computing.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Blah blah cloud. Blah blah cloud. Blah blah cloud. Blah blah cloud.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's as if your'e a technologist and a philosopher all in one!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
blah blah platform.
>>>
2011-01-06 * 
Wally says, <<<
There were eleven ways to interpret the vague assignment you gave me by voicemail.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Given the risks of choosing wrong, and my engineering oath to do no harm, it was my ehtical duty to do nothing.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You could have asked for clarification.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Sounds risky.
>>>
2011-01-05 * 
The Boss says, <<<
How much confidence do you have in your cost projections?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I trust them like I trust you.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Are the assumptions realistic?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
They're as real as your good judgment.
>>>
2011-01-04 * 
Alice says, <<<
Excuse me, but I can't concentrate when someone reminds me of a creature.
>>> Woman says, <<<
What?
>>> Alice says, <<<
You've got some sort of bilbo Baggins vibe going on here and it's throwing me off my game.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Give me a heads up if you see a walking stick coming my way.
>>>
2011-01-03 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Jim, our company is family-friendly and very green.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We're also good at setting priorities, so if I get a chance to sell your kids for a handful of carbon credits, I'll do it.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
He was less green than I had hoped.
>>>
2011-01-02 * 
Man says, <<<
Dilbert, would you like to join us for lunch?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Where are you going?
>>> Man says, <<<
We haven't decided.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
In that case, no.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I can't stand watching a small group of people trying to make a trivial decision.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It makes me lose all faith in humanity.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Food doesn't taste as good when you have no hope.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll just get somehting from the vending machine and fantasize that my co-workers are competent.

Let's see... what goes well with an unrealistic worldview?

Amber, would you like to celebrate New Year's Even with me?
>>> Amber says, <<<
I'll say maybe. That way you can't make other plans and I can wait for a better offer.
>>> Amber says, <<<
I can get away with it because of whatever is happening over there.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Yup.
>>>
2010-12-30 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
A competitor from the future is sending robots back in time to terminate our company.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So far it's not much of an issue because their time travel technology is way ahead of their robot-building skills.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Is that as fun as it looks?
>>> Alice says, <<<
Totally. They're like zombies, but crunchier.
>>>
2010-12-29 * 
Alice says, <<<
I've noticed that whenever I ask you a specific question by email, you avoid answering it.
>>> Alice says, <<<
You're either an unhelpful moron or a poorly designed robot sent from the future to terminate our company.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
How did you know it was a robot?
>>> Alice says, <<<
I didn't.
>>>
2010-12-28 * 

2010-12-27 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I feel like a failure. Say something to cheer me up?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Happiness comes from comparing yourself to a reference group that is relatively worse off.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You're a successful member of the reference group.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
And that's not nothing!
>>>
2010-12-26 * 
Coworker says, <<<
Did you read my long e-mail?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Not yet. What's it about?
>>> Coworker says, <<<
I can't say.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
If I tell you what I wrote, the effort I put into writing the e-mail will be transformed into a waste of time.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I just decided to delete your e-mail before reading it. Therefore it is already wasted.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You are now free to tell me its contents without reducing your productivity.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Oh. Okay.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
It was something about improving communication. But I worded it better.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Maybe you should read it.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Maybe you should.
>>>
2010-12-25 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Are you ready to do mental gifting?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You go first.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I imagine giving you a sweater that doesn't fit.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I imagine giving you a tool that you already have.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Merry Christmas, Dogbert.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Stupid sweater.
>>>
2010-12-24 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
I've decided to escalate my anti-social behavior from not listening, to actively talking over other people.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
How can you enjoy the conversation of others if you don't listen?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
This could be one of the best ideas I've ever had.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
It all came together when I realized that listening isn't the fun part.

Excuse me. By my count, you've said the same thing 27 times, using different words.
>>> Alice says, <<<
If I can get sworn statements from everyone here that we understand your point, will you stop talking?

That's mighty rude of you.

I dont' get your point. Can you repeat it 26 more times?

I want all of you to feel empowered on this project.

You forgot to get our buy- in before you empowered us.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'll get your buy-in later.
>>> Wally says, <<<
It's far too late for that.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm going to use my empowerment to destroy this poorly conceived project from the inside!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Don't do that!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So... now you're saying we're not empowered to do what we think is best?
>>> Alice says, <<<
Can we go back to our old system where we're afraid to make decisions and you're never available?
>>> Alice says, <<<
Your eyes say, 'Yes.'
>>>
2010-12-18 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Maybe it's not a good idea to eat a noisy bag of chips next to a speaker-phone.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Uh-oh. My common sense has wounded your ego and made you defiant.

Did you really think he would stop?

No. I hate the guy who was on the speaker-phone.

I don't see it catching on.

Give it time.

2010-12-15 * 
Wally says, <<<
Does my new goatee make me look manly and intellectual at the same time?

It makes you look too lazy to shave around your lips.

And I think I saw a flea.

Yeah. That one is resistant to soup.

Woman says, <<<
Would you like to be part of a masters forum to share knowledge across disciplines?

No. The only people who will be there are the ones who don't have anything better to do. I try to avoid people like that.
>>> Woman says, <<<
I'm the chairperson.

I'll get a lot done that day!

The Boss says, <<<
Wally, I need you to train the new mailroom guy.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Why me?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Because he's unimportant and you're worthless.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Okay, I was worried that it was the other way around.
>>> Wally says, <<<
All important messages are sent by e-mail.
>>> Wally says, <<<
So your job is to shovel all of the regular mail into recycling bins.
>>> Wally says, <<<
We won't be paying you, but you can use packages and tape to build your own igloo.
>>> Two weeks later The Boss says, <<<
Why is my desk so clean?
>>> Wally says, <<<
You're welcome.
>>>
2010-12-11 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
The only thing that matter are social networks, games and phones.

You're not working on any of that, so I arranged for the dustbin of history to do curb pickup.

Amber, would you like to see a movie that one of us will undoubtedly hate?

Does my honesty turn you on?
>>> Amber says, <<<
I just stopped liking mammals.
>>>
2010-12-09 * 
TV Newsroom Dilbert says, <<<
I invented a drug that switches off the brain's ability to make rational decisions.

I think it would make a good story for your science segment.
>>> Man says, <<<
Or we could drug-dart celebrities and film what happens.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
For science, right?
>>>
2010-12-08 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I invented a drug that makes people do stupid things. Then I dipped this dart in it.

Who can define 'values'? Anyone?

Values are a type of emotional illusion common to children, idiots and non-engineers.

Are we a cult now?

Oh no. I have seen this before. You are preparing to put your body language at odds with your words!

My endocrine system is shutting down!

2010-12-05 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
My design plan is obviously too complex for a manager to understand.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So I highlighted a few areas that are intentionally suboptimal.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Just point to the highlighted items and demand that I fix them.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That will give you the illusion of usefulness.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Pretend this is olden times when bosses knew what their employees did for a living.

To round out the fantasy, wear this hat made from a dead animal.

Can you give me a quote by next week?

Your demeanor tells me that you will never guy our product. You only want the quote as a point reference.

The request we got for a quote is vague, and the deadline for our response is tomorrow.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If I ask for clarity, we'll miss the the deadline. If I don't, our bid will either be below our cost or too high to win.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Which path of certain failure do you prefer?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I like the one that makes you work the hardest.
>>>
2010-11-22 * 
Coworker says, <<<
Wally do you have a minute?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Nope I'm far too busy.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
I'm blocking the only exit. You have no choice but to answer my question.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
I blocked the air vent too.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Well played.
>>>
2010-11-21 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Is it my imagination or is your pricing intentionally confusing?
>>> Coworker says, <<<
It's intentionally confusing.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
That way you can't compare our prices to our competitors' prices.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Our competitors do the same thing. It's called confusopoly.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
We all get our fair share of confused customers and we don't need to lower our prices to compete.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
We use the profits from our anti-competitive behavior to fun innovation.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
So don't ruin a good system by trying to understand what you're buying.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That almost sounds reasonable.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Now spank yourself and thank me!
>>>
2010-11-20 * 
Wally says, <<<
Once again, you have failed to motivate me.
>>> Wally says, <<<
You said we shouldn't be motivated by money, so I'm waiting for the new thing to kick in.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm not good at reading faces, but I think there's something happening over in this region.
>>>
2010-11-19 * 

2010-11-18 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I got your e-mail. It almost made sense.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
My plan is to act randomly and hope for the best.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Perhaps I can be more clear.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Really? You can just turn it on and off like that?
>>>
2010-11-17 * 
The man who could not summarize Man says, <<<
It all started 4.53 billion years ago during the Hadean eon.
>>> Man says, <<<
I hope you don't mind if I skip over the part where the earth formed by accretion from the solar nebula.
>>> Hours Later Man says, <<<
...And that formed what we call the moon.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Maybe I'll just ask someone else what time it is.
>>>
2010-11-16 * 
Wally says, <<<
Are you leveraging our resources to optimize the client value stream?
>>> Asok says, <<<
What?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm just messing with you? Nothing I say in meetings actually means anything.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Then why do you talk?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I tried listening once. It was awful.
>>>
2010-11-15 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Sorry, I didn't have time to get the information you asked for.
>>> Woman says, <<<
You're saying that for an entire week, every single thing you did was more important than my ten-minute request?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Yes, but the way I said it doesn't make me think of a broomstick.
>>>
2010-11-14 * 
Alice says, <<<
You didn't answer my e-mail.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
I don't check e-mail often.
>>> Alice says, <<<
The whole point of e-mail is that you check it often.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Are you an idiot or some sort of digital sociopath?
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Sometimes I don't remember to check it.
>>> Alice says, <<<
You seem like a visual learner, so let me show you how to keep e-mail in the front of your mind.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Is this your smartphone?
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Yes.
>>> BAM! Alice says, <<<
Now it's in the front of your mind. Get it?
>>>
2010-11-13 * 
Stockholder says, <<<
Hi ho! I'm a common stockholder. I'm here to see how my investment is coming along.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Okay, first on the agenda, we need to blow our budget before year end so we don't get less money next year.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
How many ten-dollar mouse pads can we get for $10,000?
>>> Stockholder says, <<<
I hope this is a panic attack.
>>>
2010-11-12 * 
The Boss says, <<<
You're two hours late.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I was doing e-mail in the parking lot.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I like to bang out a few hours of work before some idiot starts asking me dumb questions.
>>> Wally says, <<<
It would be funny if the next thing you say is in the form of a question.
>>>
2010-11-11 * 
The Boss says, <<<
My job is to create an environment where employees feel safe taking risks.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
My other job is punishing employees who make any kind of mistake.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
My point is that I'm glad I don't have your job.
>>>
2010-11-10 * 
Dogbert the Security Consultant Dogbert says, <<<
Anyone without an I.D. badge is assumed to be an enemy combatant.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Pounce on the intruder and shake him until his fillings fall out!
>>> Alice says, <<<
How much did we pay for that advice?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
It's free. I work for the dentist across the street.
>>>
2010-11-09 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I'm here to be your role model.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
My actions speak louder than my words. Just drink me in.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I think you're doing your part wrong.
>>>
2010-11-08 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
You're doing a great job as a role model.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Half of your employees have already turned into pudgy sociopaths.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
And they're quick to anger.
>>>
2010-11-07 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I'd like to thank all of the people who helped design the technology test parameters.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Thanks to your input, the test had nothing in common with how things work in the real world.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So I wasted two weeks of my life on a test that is not only meaningless...
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
...But alos dangerously misleading.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
This slide shows the gap between the test results and reality.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We'll use the test results anyway because it's the only data we have.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Fine. I hope you all choke to death on your lunches.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Why's he so cranky?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Something about data.
>>>
2010-11-06 * 
Wally says, <<<
A Swedish study in 2009 showed that people with bad bosses had 40% more heart attacks.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Aaak!!!
>>> Wally says, <<<
I should want you that I'll probably tell this story a few times.
>>>
2010-11-05 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Can you put the PX9 system on the R3 network?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Yes.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But just to be clear. What an engineer can do is rarely what he should do.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
What should you do?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Apparently, your job.
>>>
2010-11-04 * 

2010-11-03 * 
Coworker says, <<<
What do you think of my plan, Alice?
>>> Alice says, <<<
I'll bet your left brain is so tiny that you stagger in a clockwise direction.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
I'll ask someone else.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Walk toward the credenza and you'll have a good chance of hitting the doorway.
>>>
2010-11-02 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Are you running into any problems?
>>> Alice says, <<<
Only the kind that you make worse.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Name one problem that I make worse!
>>> Alice says, <<<
I have too many distractions.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Do you have any problems that aren't like that one?
>>> Alice says, <<<
Only in my fantasies.
>>>
2010-11-01 * 
Catbert says, <<<
I'm getting a lot of complaints about you eating your lunch in the clean room.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
And people don't like it when you use a loofah in there.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
That's my french bread. And I can't help it if my back itches.
>>>
2010-10-31 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I need this class to update my skills. Will you approve the expense?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Where's the analysis of alternatives?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
When you ask for funding, you need to tell me what my options are.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Well, okay. That seems logical.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Option two. Do nothing while I become increasingly unqualified for my job.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Option three: replace me with someone younger who earns less than I do and already has the skills.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Oh.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Options are only good when other people don't have them.
>>>
2010-10-30 * 
Catbert says, <<<
For the past six months you've done nothing but update your Facebook page.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Now we have an opening for a marketing manager for social networks and you're totally qualified. It's a huge raise and promotion.
>>> Man says, <<<
Crime pays! I knew it!!!
>>> Catbert says, <<<
We're hoping you can lie as well as you steal.
>>>
2010-10-29 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Asok, you've been such a good intern that I've decided to promote you.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Your new status is called limbo. You will exist in a plane between the living and the damned.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Yes!!! I will exist!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Great. It went right to his head.
>>>
2010-10-28 * 
Wally says, <<<
I'm taking your advice to be more entrepreneurial at my job.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Failing 90% of the time is very similar to not trying at all. I'm pretty sure you won't be able to tell the difference.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Which one am I doing now?
>>>
2010-10-27 * 

2010-10-26 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Our project plan is so complicated that failure is assured.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But complexity is too abstract for you to manage, so instead you will spray me energy into the vortex of failure.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Go.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I need you to finish it six weeks sooner for a trade show.
>>>
2010-10-25 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Tradition requires that every meeting has one buzzword-babbling idiot.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
We have no natural today, so Asok has graciously agreed to fill the role.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Good job. You're totally selling it.
>>> Asok says, <<<
We need a multi-platform application strategy!
>>>

2010-10-22 * 
Coworker says, <<<
I'm updating my friend resource matrix and I have a few gaps.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
I already have a friend with a truck, a friend who gives me free tickets, and a friend with tools.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
I've got openings for a computer expert friend and a frisky friend with low standards.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll try the computer one.
>>>
2010-10-21 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Walmart started selling a knockoff of our product for nine cents apiece.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'm looking for ideas. Anyone? Anyone?
>>> Wally says, <<<
They'll need more greeters.
>>>
2010-10-20 * 
Ken says, <<<
I hate sales. Can you cross-train me to be an engineer?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Absolutely. All you need is a time machine and a brain with twice as many folds as your current model.
>>> Ken says, <<<
Maybe I could try marketing.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's just liqour and guessing.
>>>
2010-10-19 * 
Catbert: <<<
Evil Director of Human Resources Ken says, <<<
Every time I get near my sales bonus level, the pointy-haired boss raises the target!
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Ha ha ha! That's the funniest thing I've ever heard! He just yanks it away! Ha ha ha!
>>> Ken says, <<<
I was hoping for some support.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Then buy a cane and talk to the tail! Ooogah!
>>>
2010-10-18 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Ken, you've almost reached your sales bonus level with time to spare.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Obviously I set your bonus threshold too low. I'll need to adjust it upward retroactively.
>>> Ken says, <<<
Maybe I'm just a great salesperson!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
That's the spirit! Stay hungry!
>>>
2010-10-17 * 

2010-10-16 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Asok, I want you to make decision as if you owned the company.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Clear out your desk, you worthless bag of meat!
>>> Asok says, <<<
Sorry. The fake power went to my head for a moment.
>>>
2010-10-15 * 
The Boss says, <<<
How can we rebuild the trust of our customers? Let's brainstorm.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
We could stop using misleading benchmark tests to sell shoddy products that have hidden costs.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I heard someone say 'lie.' Let's write that one down.
>>>
2010-10-14 * 

2010-10-13 * 
Dogbert Consults Dogbert says, <<<
Customer data is an asset that you can sell.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
It's totally ethical because our customers would do the same thing to us if they could.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Sounds fair.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
In phase one, we'll dehumanize the enemy by calling them 'data.'
>>>
2010-10-12 * 
Dogbert Consults Dogbert says, <<<
Your customer data is worth a fortune.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I'll find you some buyers if you give me 25%.
>>> CEO says, <<<
What about privacy?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
That's not a problem. I never use my real name.
>>>
2010-10-11 * 

2010-10-10 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Wally, have you made any progress coding your module?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Progress is difficult to measure in the software realm.
>>> Wally says, <<<
You could measure the lines of code I produce, but that would reward inefficiency.
>>> Wally says, <<<
The art of this job is binding the rare moments of inspiration to knowledge and machines.
>>> Wally says, <<<
In fact, just a minute ago I could feel the inspiration welling up inside me.
>>> Wally says, <<<
But then you interrupted me with your naive question and the moment was lost.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Maybe you should go back to your office and reflect on the damage you've done here today.
>>> Wally thinks, <<<
There goes the one person who has less of a real job than I do.
>>>
2010-10-09 * 
The Boss says, <<<
You mission is to assassinate the motivation of my rival.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I want you to attend a meeting with him and drain the optimism out of his body.
>>> Man says, <<<
What is happening to my sense of hope?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Let it happen.
>>>
2010-10-08 * 
The Boss says, <<<
The customer is an attractive young woman. You'll need to bring a handsome man with you to translate.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The translator will repeat everything you say, word for word, but he'll say it more handsomely.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Hi.
>>> Customer says, <<<
What's he jabbering about?
>>>
2010-10-07 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Carol, how can I make you feel more inspired by your work?
>>> Carol says, <<<
I'm an admin, you steaming log. The only thing that would inspire me is finding your corpse floating in my worst enemy's drinking water.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's just something they make me ask.
>>> Carol says, <<<
Can I get back to my meaningless work now?
>>>
2010-10-06 * 
CEO says, <<<
Mister Dogbert will describe our 'poison pill' strategy for preventing an unfriendly takeover.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
It turns out that no one wants to buy a criminally mismanaged quagmire. So you're all set.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Maybe next time you won't skip the pre-meeting.
>>>
2010-10-05 * 
Coworker says, <<<
What do you get when you combine cognitive bias with inaccurate information?
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Our business strategy! Hahahahahaha!!!
>>> Coworker says, <<<
I guess I should keep my day job.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Good luck with that.
>>>
2010-10-04 * 
Coworker says, <<<
Alice broke my arm. You need to do something about this.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Okay. I'll compare Alice's economic value to yours and decide who to fire.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
No fair! She's an engineer!
>>> Catbert says, <<<
You got beat up by someone who is also better at math?
>>>
2010-10-03 * 

2010-10-02 * 
Man says, <<<
Our ad campaign will portray users of our competitor's products as baby-eating hobos.
>>> Man says, <<<
While our users will be portrayed by the coolest guy in the entire world.
>>> Soon the meeting turned ugly Alice says, <<<
Then why are you showing a slide of a giant @$$#%*?
>>>
2010-10-01 * 
Man says, <<<
Our marketing campaign depends on a word of mouth. Unfortunately, our product is bad.
>>> Man says, <<<
So we found a guy with poor judgment and a huge mouth to say good things.
>>> Man 2 says, <<<
Present.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Marketing isn't a real thing, is it?
>>> Man says, <<<
It's mostly guessing.
>>>
2010-09-30 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Don't be afraid of change, Asok.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Okay. Wait. What?
>>> Asok says, <<<
You subtle implication is that I should change to be more like you!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Bumpy start.
>>> Asok says, <<<
I choose death!
>>>
2010-09-29 * 
Alice says, <<<
Carol, this is my new boyfriend, Angry Jack.
>>> Alice says, <<<
I met him in a restaurant after he beat up a busser for bringing a bent fork.
>>> Carol says, <<<
In thie white trash community, we call that a red flag.
>>> Alice says, <<<
You weren't there. That fork was a mess.
>>>
2010-09-28 * 
Alice says, <<<
Dilbert, meet my new boyfriend, angry Jack.
>>> Alice says, <<<
People say my high level of engineering skill comes at the cost of good social judgment.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Alice, his name is Angry Jack.
>>> Alice says, <<<
I think he wants to hold my hand now.
>>>
2010-09-27 * 
Woman says, <<<
What's your take on this, Dilbert?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What? Sorry. I was using this time to think about something useful.
>>> Woman says, <<<
Maybe your boss can fill you in.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I was brain-golfing.
>>>
2010-09-26 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Interview this applicant and tell me if he's right for our company.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Tim, we don't set the bar as high as we used to.
>>><BRWally says, <<<
In our golden days, we insisted on employees who could work tirelessly through the night.
>>> Wally says, <<<
As business slowed, we were happy with anyone who put in eight hours a day.
>>> Wally says, <<<
then our best people left.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Now on cubicles are mostly used for napping.
>>> Wally says, <<<
So my question is this: Would a ringing phone wak you up?
>>> Tim says, <<<
Probably.
>>> Wally says, <<<
He comes across as a braggart.
>>>

Communication Skills Training Dogbert says, <<<
Today you will learn how to listen to idiots without snoring.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Break into groups of two, with one idiot and one non-idiot in each pair.
>>>
2010-09-24 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I signed you up for a class to try and get rid of that thing you have.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What thing?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The thing. You know. The thing that makes you the way you are.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
My personality?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Exactly. But we call it communication skills because it sounds less rude.
>>>
2010-09-23 * 
Dogbert the Pitchman Dogbert says, <<<
Fire up the reality distortion field as soon as I'm introduced.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Our product is nothing but a block of wood, and yet you need three of them.

Alice says, <<<
GAAA!!! II HURTS SO BAD!

That artificial display of pain was a reminder that software is not created by magic.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The Elves are getting uppity.
>>>
2010-09-19 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I don't understand either of your technical proposals, and I need to pick one.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Normally I'd use favoritism, but I don't like either one of you.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
So I'll give you an intelligence test, and I'll approve the proposal of whoever is the smartest.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
If you shoot an arrow at a monkey from an airplane...
>>> The Boss says, <<<
And the monkey throws a coconut at the incoming arrow to stop it, but he misses...
>>> The Boss says, <<<
How can you tell what time it is?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
There's not enough data.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
You look at your watch?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The correct answer is 'Ask the monkey and hope he doesn't hold a grudge.
>>>
2010-09-18 * 
Asok says, <<<
Soon my book of pointy-haired boss quotes will be published and I will be rich.
>>> Wally says, <<<
It sounds great. I can't wait to get my pirated copy.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Or you could buy it.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I thought you said it was a book.
>>>
2010-09-17 * 
Dogbert Publishing Dogbert says, <<<
I'm assigning a ghost writer to tighten up your first draft.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Technically, he's not a ghost yet. He's just a guy who lost a knife fight.
>>> Asok says, <<<
How long do I have to wait?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
If you're in a hurry, steer him toward the window.
>>>
2010-09-16 * 
Asok says, <<<
Good news: I got a book deal based entirely on the dumb things you've said.
>>> Asok says, <<<
It's totally legal because the law only protects 'intellectual' property.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Frugga bugga!!!
>>> Asok says, <<<
And so began the sequel.

Beth says, <<<
As the marketing manager for social media, my job is to use these two words a lot.
>>> Beth says, <<<
Marketing through social media is like herding cats. And just to make it interesting, many of the cats are drunk and stupid.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Burn.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
I am totally defriending that witch.
>>>
2010-09-13 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Beth is our new marketing manager for social media.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
By the way, company policy forbids the use of Facebook and Twitter at work. And we don't trust you to work from home.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
If you blog about how lame we are, you're fired!!!
>>> Beth thinks, <<<
First day, not so good.
>>>
2010-09-12 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I need this room for my meeting.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Wouldn't it make more sense for you to get a different room since we're already here?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
All of the conference rooms are booked.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Okay, then I guess we should compare the importance of your meeting versus this one.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
That's not how it works.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Conference rooms go to the highest ranked manager.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It took me months to schedule this meeting!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Scram.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The goal of this meeting is to figure out why nothing ever gets done around here.
>>>
2010-09-11 * 
Catbert says, <<<
We need someone to run focus groups about our existing products.
>>> Frankenstein says, <<<
What is a focus group?
>>> Catbert says, <<<
In our case, it's like mob of angry villagers armed with sharp pens.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
And you'd also be the fire marshal for the floor. Are you in?
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Yeah. It's a tough job market.
>>>
2010-09-10 * 
The Boss says, <<<
We need to shut down our crime scene cleaning division.

Apparently your assistant, Ratbert, has been putting human remains in the recycling bins.

That's a harmless mistake. What's the worst thing that could happen?

2010-09-09 * 
Crime Scene Cleaning Dilbert says, <<<
There's no budget for a mop or cleaning supplies.

All I have is this pole and you.

You could duct tape me to the pole.

Yup. If we had duct tape.
>>>
2010-09-08 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Ratbert, would you like to be my assistant in the crime scene cleaning profession?
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
Me?!
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
You had me at 'brains and squeegees.'
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I didn't say any of those words.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
Would it kill you to say them now?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If it does, you can clean me up.
>>>
2010-09-07 * 
Woman says, <<<
I love your tie-dyed overalls. That's a bold look.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Actually, my job is cleaning crime scenes. I didn't have time to change.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The singles scene is all about how you look.
>>>
2010-09-06 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I got transferred to our crime scene cleanup subsidiary.

I have a competitive advantage because I have the customer lists from our other subsidiaries.

No, we haven't had any deadly computer explosions here.

Woman says, <<<
I need a minor change to our website.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Give me your business case for the change and I'll prioritize it for the queue.
>>> Woman says, <<<
I don't have time to write a business case for one little change.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I can't justify changing my priorities without one.
>>> Woman says, <<<
GAAAA!!! Why can't we do the simplest things in this stupid company???!
>>> Wally says, <<<
Try one of these corporate post-traumatic stress pills to dull your memory of these events.
>>> Woman says, <<<
What? Where am I? Who are you?
>>> Wally says, <<<
You were just leaving.
>>> Wally says, <<<
They're placebos, but I find that they solve 20% of my problems.

2010-09-04 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I have a new job for you. Our product is defective and it's killing customers.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You want me to organize a recall?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
No.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Engineer a fix?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
No.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You'll need overalls, several barrels of bleach and some sort of scrubby brush.
>>>
2010-09-03 * 
Company Lawyer Lawyer says, <<<
We should consider doing a recall on our product.
>>> Lawyer says, <<<
When it warms up, it explodes and hurls poisonous spines in every direction.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Where's the director of quality assurance?
>>> Lawyer says, <<<
Pinned to the test lab ceiling.

2010-09-02 * 
Catbert says, <<<
Wally, we're concerned about the comments you made on your anonymous employee survey.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Your comments are disturbingly similar to the unabomber's manifesto.
>>> Wally says, <<<
He was a good writer.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
We have a problem.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Is it a copyright thing?
>>>
2010-09-01 * 
The Boss says, <<<
According to the anonymous online employee survey, you don't trust management. What's up with that?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Oh. Right.
>>>
2010-08-31 * 
Alice says, <<<
Did I tell you I'm doing two jobs now?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
About a million times.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You've complained about it so much that it's like a song I can't get out of my head.
>>> Alice says, <<<
I only found out yesterday.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm trying to get ahead of it.
>>>
2010-08-30 * 
Catbert says, <<<
Good news, Alice. You got the internal job you posted for.
>>> Alice says, <<<
YES!!!
>>> Catbert says, <<<
You'll need to keep doing your old job too.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Did you just make me celebrate a doubling of my workload?
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Thank you for acknowledging my awesomeness.

2010-08-29 * 
Carl says, <<<
Let's have lunch so I can tell you about our products.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
No thanks.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I don't like meeting new people.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Every person I meet chips away at my freedom.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If I have lunch with you, I'll feel an obligation to return your pestering phone calls.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
My lunchtime is the only chance I get during the day to scrape off the leeches.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Nothing personal.
>>> Woman says, <<<
Do you want to have lunch and discuss our new product line?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Sure!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Carl, you are totally in the wrong profession.
>>>
2010-08-28 * 
The Boss says, <<<
We're getting some heat from the media for using Elbonian slave labor ot build our products.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I've been trying to tell the media that it's not as bad as it sounds.
>>> ELBONIA Elboanian says, <<<
Now I'll be the slave and you be the oppressor!
>>> Elbonian 2 says, <<<
No!!! Not yet!

Wally says, <<<
I get sleepy in the afternoon. And I'm not a morning person.

I'm at my best for about an hour in between, which explains why I'm an exceptionally good lunch eater.

How's the workforce skills assessment going?
>>> Catbert says, <<<
I just sold all of my company stock.

Carol says, <<<
For the past five years I've managed your calendar based solely on what would create the least work for me.
>>> Carol says, <<<
It all started when you told me to use my judgment to set priorities.
>>> Carol says, <<<
In retrospect, you should have hired someone with low self-esteem.
>>>
2010-08-24 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I need you to delete all of the unnecessary data from our servers to make room.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Technically it's all unnecessary because our decisions are always based on flawed logic anyway.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Can you pretend some of it is necessary?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Sure. Can you pretned I deleted the stuff that isn't?

This is Rodney. He's in charge of product safety testing.

$#%*

CEO says, <<<
Have you met the new head regulator for our industry?
>>> CEO says, <<<
At first it was inconvenient to feed him.
>>> CEO says, <<<
Luckily I started lactating.

Have you tried kibble?
>>>
2010-08-19 * 
The Boss says, <<<
We're reincorporating in Dogbertland for tax reasons.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Where?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's a floating patch of garbage in the Pacific Ocean the size of Texas.
>>> In Dogbertland Ratbert says, <<<
How's the banking system?
>>> Fly says, <<<
Business is booming, King Ratbert.

My new look is a black turtleneck and old man jeans. What do you think?

You look like a total juice bag.

That's good, right?

What answer gets me back to watching my shows on Hulu?

I invented a music device that reads your brain waves and only plays songs that fit your mood.

Kung Fu coffee cup!

Hey, look what I invented!
>>>
2010-08-15 * 
The Boss says, <<<
We'll break into small groups to discuss options.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Why? Do you think we'll be smarter when we're in small groups?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
That way everyone gets more time to talk.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
According to your theory, the ideal group size would be one person talking to himself.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
No, you also need the knowledge and perspective that extra people bring.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That would argue for larger groups, not smaller ones.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Fine! Just break into whatever size groups you think make sense.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I like your style, Dilbert.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Thank you for noticing.
>>>
2010-08-14 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
My company is going to a web-only business model.
>>> Mom says, <<<
That's terrific.
>>> Mom says, <<<
What's phase three? Does it involve operating only in your own imagination?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Be nice.
>>> Mom says, <<<
Maybe you can help me grow this plant back into a seed.
>>>
2010-08-13 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
You're a third-rate company in a dying industry.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I recommend consultant-assisted corporate suicide.

Will it hurt?

It might sting a little when you announce your'e going to be a web-only company.

The Boss says, <<<
I asked my dentist to put vampire tips on my incisors so I'd be more intimidating.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Here comes Alice. Watch me put the fear into her.
>>> Alice says, <<<
You need to lose a few pounds to pull of the vampire look. This is more of a walrus vibe.
>>>
2010-08-11 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
We added a new performance test, but learned that the test itself is flawed.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Now our product fails our own tests and our customers are asking to see the test results.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Do I have permission to fake the test data?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I didn't even know data can be real.
>>>
2010-08-10 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I need answers to these questions for a confidential project. I can't tell you more.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
I'm a complete idiot and even I can deduce from your questions what the project must be.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I anticipated that, so some of you idiots are getting placebo questions.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Well played.
>>>
2010-08-09 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I need you to work on a highly confidential project.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
When you're done, I want you to dig your own shallow grave and beat yourself to death with the shovel.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Why does it feel as if my entire career has been preparation for this project?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You're welcome.
>>>
2010-08-08 * 

2010-08-07 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
That's my plan. I'd like to thank all of you for your utter apathy.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
A few of your stayed awake, and I think I got some accidental eye contact once when the A.C. made a noise.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
In conclusion, I hate my job, I hate my coworkers, and I hope feral cats eat every one of you.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Are you taking questions?
>>>
2010-08-06 * 

2010-08-05 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I added my name to your patent application.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I could have stopped you from working on it, but I didn't. I'm like an artist who understands negative space.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Do you know what negative space is, Dilbert?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm living in it!!!
>>>

Dogbert the empire builder consultant Dogbert says, <<<
Success is just attendance plus luck.

Wow. I just doubled the bit rate.

Wally says, <<<
I made a script to write from the UFR SQL function to a log table I created for the DB so I can find the parameter errors.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm giving you this status update while the script is running, so I'm accomplishing two things now.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
How do I know you really did that thing you just said?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I guess now I'm doing your job too.
>>>
2010-08-01 * 
Mom says, <<<
Dilbert, could you help me fill out this rebate form the next time you visit?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Sure, mom.
>>> Mom says, <<<
Also, my laptop keeps crashing.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll take a look at it.
>>> Mom says, <<<
My TV is acting up again too.
>>> Mom says, <<<
And maybe you could show me how to change my ringtone.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Do you really need all of that help?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Or is this an elaborate scheme to inoculate against me ever wanting to move back home?
>>> Mom says, <<<
We have a bad connection! What? What? What?
>>> Mom thinks, <<<
That should buy me another six months.
>>>
2010-07-31 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
There's no objective standard for measuring how much I should accomplish in any given day.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Nor can we really know if things would have turned out better had I don't things differently.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Do you have a point?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm going home early. See if you can tell the difference.
>>>
2010-07-30 * 
Woman says, <<<
Maybe we could take a pottery class together.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Sure. I love acquiring unattractive dishware in an expensive and inefficient way.
>>> Woman says, <<<
It's called art.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Maybe we could whittle some art spoons too.
>>>
2010-07-29 * 
Dogbert the public relations consultant Dogbert says, <<<
The public won't forgive you until you fake some remorse.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
These glasses have a hose that leads to a pumping station and a huge reservoir of fake tears.
>>> CEO says, <<<
If we have another press conference, we should crack open a window.
>>>
2010-07-28 * 

2010-07-27 * 
CEO says, <<<
The media is on our back because we accidentally destroyed the Statue of Liberty. We need your P.R. advice.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Did you take full responsibility and promise to clean up the harbor?
>>> CEO says, <<<
Ooh.
>>> Earlier that day CEO says, <<<
Many of you don't know that the Statue of Liberty was very old... and made entirely of fish food.
>>>
2010-07-26 * 
Coworker says, <<<
We're planning to introduce our new military product with a light show in New York harbor.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Wally, can you handle the weapon demo and the light show?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Sure. What could go wrong?
>>> One week later Dilbert says, <<<
They're calling it 'The Stump of Liberty.'
>>> Wally says, <<<
No one is saying it was a boring show.

The Boss says, <<<
The people buying our company don't know that your project exists.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
And you're not allowed to talk to anyone over there. But don't lose hope.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'm working hard to upgrade your status from nonexistent to unimportant.
>>>
2010-07-20 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I wouldn't worry about losing your job after the merger.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Because you put in a good word for me?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
No, it's more of an observation that I don't worry about other people's jobs.

2010-07-19 * 

2010-07-18 * 
Woman says, <<<
And that's our new marketing video. We hope it will go viral.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You'll have our comments by tomorrow.
>>> Woman says, <<<
I'm not asking for comments. The video is already finished.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The technology claims in the video are criminally inaccurate.
>>> Woman says, <<<
I sent the script to engineering for comments three months ago!
>>> Woman says, <<<
I got an email back from someone named Wally who said it was great.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I thought she was asking if it was funny.
>>>
2010-07-17 * 
Wally says, <<<
I'm on my way to a meeting with a prospective customer.
>>> Wally says, <<<
We have such a long sales gestation period that the value of my efforts won't be known for two years.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Just remember that optimism looks exactly like doing nothing.
>>>
2010-07-16 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I found a way to keep our best talent from leaving.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Wow! You found a way to interface a human brain with a robot body to get the best of both!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Actually, it's just a cool display case, but your thing would be good too.
>>>
2010-07-15 * 
Wally says, <<<
I finally saved enough money to retire anytime I want.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Someone should invent a witty name for that amount of money.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
$%@# *@U
>>> Wally says, <<<
Perfect! Can I use that?
>>>
2010-07-14 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
If my low self-esteem seems low, that's because I drove here in a rented tuna can on wheels.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It was such a bad automotive experience that I can't even pretend you should care what I have to say.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I loathe myself and the company that pays me. Who's with me on this.
>>>
2010-07-13 * 

2010-07-12 * 
The Boss says, <<<
The opening is in sales. Do you like to travel.
>>> Man says, <<<
Yes. It's my favorite thing.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
No one likes business travel. You're either an idiot or you've never done business travel.
>>> Man says, <<<
How dare you accuse me of not traveling.
>>>
2010-07-11 * 
The Boss says, <<<
A successful transformation requires employees to feel ownership for the change.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Change? What change?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Is there something we don't know?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's important that everyone has clear roles and responsibilities.
>>> Alice says, <<<
What are you trying to tell us? Should we stop working on our projects?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'll keep you engaged and energized with my clear communication.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
And as your leader, I will role-model the desired change.
>>> Alice says, <<<
If he's our role model, I guess we need to act like morons who can't communicate.

I need new people.

The Boss says, <<<
Alice, I need you to give a presentation to the entire sales division.
>>> Alice says, <<<
GAAA!!! The very thought of public speaking dehydrates me!

Maybe I should find someone moister.
>>>
2010-07-07 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I'm happy to report that none of our oil rigs exploded.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Our children's pharmaceuticals are not tainted with bacteria, and the government is not investigating our financial practices.

All we're doing is quietly losing share-holder value.

I need to get some of that work-life balance I keep hearing about.

I thought about work all last night at home, so what do I do now?

It's not too late to get in on this.
>>>
2010-07-04 * 
Man says, <<<
Wally, can you respond to this RFQ by tomorrow?
>>> Wally says, <<<
That depends.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I take a disciplined approach to allocation my limited resources.
>>> Wally says, <<<
First, I'll need to evaluate all of the alternative uses for my time.
>>> Wally says, <<<
If doing this RFQ thing comes out on top, then yes, I can do it.
>>> Man says, <<<
When do you think you will know that?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Maybe next week. Unless something comes up.
>>> Man says, <<<
So... you're useless.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I don't see you getting much done right now either.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Did you know that being disciplined is almost the same as being useless?

Yoda? Is that you?

I've decided to move to a rolling forecast.

If my sarcasm is a problem, I can solve that by doing more of it.

Make sure you coordinate with the brand manager and the category manager.

And also the clients, the account execs, the project leaders, strategic planning, facilities management, product managers, marketing, and I.T.

All I heard was 'give up.'

Let's meet again in a year.

I wish all of my problems were this easy to solve.

Dilbert says, <<<
My success depends on your doing your role in a timely and energetic manner.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
People say you're a big, fat slug, but I have confidence in you. I'll stick this to your slimy face and hope for the best.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I like to think I'm a pretty good judge of character.
>>>
2010-06-28 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I based my estimate on the reliable input of people who just wanted me to leave them alone.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I decided against labeling it because I'll probably need some deniability later.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Are we done with the dry run, or do you want me to use up all of my energy before our CEO gets here?
>>>
2010-06-27 * 
Tina says, <<<
I need help with my computer.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's a trap!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If I touch your computer, you'll think that every future problem is caused by something I did.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You'll tell everyone I ruined your computer!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll be obligated to solve every computer problem you have from this day on.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
My own projects will be left to wither as I show you for the ninethieth time how to select a new font.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If I refuse to help, you'll tell my boss I'm not a team play.
>>> Tina says, <<<
Do you need a hug?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Only if you can squeeze hard enough to kill me.
>>>
2010-06-26 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Can you get me some failure estimates for our next gen product?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I can if you like numbers that are based on hallucinated assumptions.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I kind of do.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I think we have an understanding.
>>>
2010-06-25 * 
Dilbert thinks, <<<
Uh-oh. My audience has fallen into a Powerpoint coma.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
The only thing I can do now is put them in funny poses and leave.
>>> Police Officer says, <<<
It looks like his finger hit brain.
>>>
2010-06-24 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Rumor has it that you're pretending to hear things wrong to avoid work.
>>> Wally says, <<<
It works great. The secret is to have no shame whatsoever.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Wally, do you have the revised budget estimate?
>>> Wally says, <<<
No, because you asked for a remized bugmet yestitet.
>>>
2010-06-23 * 
Coworker says, <<<
Wally, did you review the client's specs like I asked you to?
>>> Wally says, <<<
What?!
>>> Wally says, <<<
I thought you asked me to 'preview the lion's pecs.'
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Why would I ask you to preview a lion's pecs?!!
>>> Wally says, <<<
So... now you want me to question everything you say?
>>>
2010-06-22 *

We wanted different things.

The Boss says, <<<
A good leader uses a process for making decisions.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
May I take this one?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Go.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Make us proud.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Question: If making a decision is just a process, why can't a computer do it?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Because sometimes I have to rely on my gut.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Which part of your gut is the smart part? Is it the stomach lining, or maybe the colon?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'm talking about instinct. It's an indefinable leadership quality.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Is the indefinable thing like a superstition?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Or cooties?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's a process!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Is that your colon talking?
>>>
2010-06-19 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I hired a confusopoly consultant to help us design an extended warranty plan.

Aren't you married?

You owe me an old carpet.

2010-06-16 * 
Wally says, <<<
I propose an unholy alliance.

You have my attention.

Reserve every meeting room under my name for the year. That way you won't need to do any scheduling, and I won't need to attend any meetings.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Don't panic; that strange feeling is you falling in love with me.
>>> Carol says, <<<
It feels like I'm eating cheese!

Man says, <<<
Look at this app!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Look at this app.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You said the Dogbert app is supposed to make a funny noise.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I'll bet it did.
>>>
2010-06-14 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I'd like to waste the better part of my afternoon trying to upgrade my phone.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll just set up my sport chair, and use my laptop while you mumble and stare at your monitor for what seems like forever.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Look at me! I'm beating your system!
>>> Man says, <<<
Quiet! I'm trying to stare.
>>>
2010-06-13 * 
Dogbert Consults Dogbert says, <<<
A good leader cultivates internal critics so all sides of an argument are heard.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
For example, I cultivated Dilbert to argue the point I just made.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Your premise is that a leader is not qualified to make decisions without the help of critics.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But selecting the appropriate critic is itself a decision.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
There is no reason to assume a leader is any better at selecting a critic than he is at making any other decision.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Your overpaid consultant is recommending that you add randomness to an already flawed process.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
In summary, this meeting is a waste of time, and your consultant is ripping you off.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
How great was that? You owe me $400 for my time.
>>>
2010-06-12 * 
Wally says, <<<
This is where you jack into matrix management, Neo.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Insert these iPod ear buds and fire up PowerPoint. The reality you once knew is gone.
>>> Wally says, <<<
One more thing: If your computer dies during powerpoint, your career dies in the real world.

Employee satisfaction has doubled since last year!

The credit goes to our new program of firing smart people.
>>> Alice says, <<<
You're safe.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Yeff!!!
>>>
2010-06-09 * 
Wally says, <<<
This week I mapped our applications to our domains and defined the interface between our applications and our software environment.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Whatever you did this week probably seems lame compared to all of that.
>>> Wally says, <<<
The stuff I'm doing is way up here in what's called in the integration layer.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
What's he's been reading?
>>>
2010-06-08 * 
Carol says, <<<
We're having a birthday cake for Scott in the break room.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
No thanks. I prefer cake that isn't frosted with the spit of recent candle-blowing.
>>> Carol says, <<<
Oooh, look at the Queen of England who likes her cake without spit. What's it like to be fancy?
>>>
2010-06-07 * 
Alice says, <<<
We've pieced together the fragments of your poor communication and believe we have deduced your strategy.
>>> Alice says, <<<
It appears that you are trying to get paid for doing little more than giving stupid labels to things.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's called managing!
>>> Alice says, <<<
Good one.
>>>

Tina says, <<<
I'm collecting money for Ted's birthday.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Pass. I can't stand that idiot.
>>> Alice says, <<<
His face looks like a ferret eating a lemon.
>>> Alice says, <<<
He makes my skin crawl.
>>> Alice says, <<<
He tells racist jokes, and I think he's embezzling.
>>> Tina says, <<<
I've been dating him for a month.
>>> Alice says, <<<
I'd be lying if I said that wasn't worth a dollar.
>>>
2010-06-05 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Your quality metric for next year is to win 30% more bid proposals.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
No problem. I'll use my magic powers to control how much our competitors bid.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I worry that you're not taking this seriously.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If the muggles find out, I'll wipe their memories.

Keep typing, Beverly! He doesn't exist.

Wally says, <<<
What's more important- our core systems or our key processes?
>>> Wally says, <<<
If there's no clear answer to that question, I'll continue to act randomly.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Get out of my office.
>>> Wally says, <<<
The open door policy probably looked good on paper.
>>>
2010-06-02 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
This next slide shows all of the possible names for our product that are not already trademarked.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Are there any that don't remind people of this general area of the human body?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That narrows it down to the names of accused war criminals, and the funnier nicknames for partnerless loving.
>>>
2010-06-01 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
After our first date, I pulled together some links to studies that debunk every belief you have.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I alphabetized them. For example, here's Feng Shui, then homeopathy, then horoscope.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's okay. I always budget a little extra for second dates.

Guess what, Ted? I volunteered to run a critical project while knowing I don't have enough resources.
>>> Alice says, <<<
When it becomes a crisis, I will delcare martial law and order you to become my flunky.
>>> Alice says, <<<
In your face, puppet boy!

This day is turning out to be a little extra sucky.

Wally says, <<<
I invented a sink that attaches to my body. The faucet is activated by your voice.

Wally, what possible use could this stupid thing have? I need you to do some real work.
>>> Wally says, <<<
What? I can't hear you when the water is running!
>>>
2010-05-23 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I finished the business case.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You said you would try to get funding if the numbers look good.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I never said that.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I clearly remember it. I can describe our conversation word for word.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I probably said something that sounded like 'I will get funding' and you heard it wrong.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What exactly sounds like 'I will get funding'?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Landfill wet hunting.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's not even a good try!!!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Shake it off.
>>>
2010-05-22 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Alice, I called this meeting because you're the only person I trust to give me honest feedback on my strategy.
>>> Alice says, <<<
It's great. It's amazing. It's the best strategy in the universe.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I thought you were honest.
>>> Alice says, <<<
That's a common misperception. I just hate people.

Was it human error?

I doubt it

No human would be that stupid. My best guess is that a cabbage got access to your computer.

Cabbbages can't use computers.

Can they tell when they're being mocked?

The Boss says, <<<
We're in merger talks, but it's business as usual until it goes through.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm free! My efforts won't influence my rewards!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I said business as usual.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I was totally planning to do this today.
>>>
2010-05-18 * 
The Boss says, <<<
If you help bring in a new account, I'll give you a raise, unless there's no money in the budget then for raises.

Please don't say what I think you're going to say next.

It's better than nothing.

No it isn't!

It's time for your operating system upgrade.

Gaaa!

Please don't! My CMS software won't work with the new operating system. I'll be a technology have-not!

It's never good when they wear costumes to complain.

I asked Wolfgang to join us.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
He's a software genius, if not a legend.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
He knows more than all of you put together.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Plus his name is Wolfgang.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Some say his talent is a genetic mutation. Others say that god speaks to him in Unix.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
All we know for sure is that he glows, and he never needs to eat.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I feel a chill. It means he's appraoching.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Please don't reprogram my DNA and make me a monkey-man!!!

People make a lot of assumptions when you change your name to Wolfgang and stop shaving.

Your social security number has been sold.

If I hire you, you'll get minimum wage to attend meetings and pretend you're me.

My plan is to get hired for several jobs and replace myself with low-paid look-alikes in each one.
>>> Man says, <<<
My plan is to bury you in a shallow grave and assume your identity.
>>> Wally says, <<<
You don't interview well.

2010-05-12 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I told you to get a sign-off from marketing before you sent this around.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
How vivid is your false memory of that conversation?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's plenty vivid.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Were unicorns involved?

2010-05-11 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Carol, form a tiger team to move the junk from the small conference room.
>>> Carol says, <<<
I'm glad you call it a tiger team so I don't feel sad that my job involves relocating junk.
>>> Carol says, <<<
Could I be less happy right now?!!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I ordered tiger costumes.

It's not right to use your tech support job to trick people into hurting themselves.

I help people take their minds off of hopeless technical problems.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
How do you know a problem is hopeless?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Great. So now pessimism is a crime?
>>>
2010-05-02 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I'm working at home today so I can concentrate without any distractions.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Please don't disturb me. Nothing is so important that it can't wait.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I take that as a challenge.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
No, please...
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Do you smell that?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I'm pretty sure it's a gas leak.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Have you noticed that the lamp makes huge sparks every once in a while?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I wouldn't worry. What's the worst thing that could happen?

I think I hear a baby trapped in the wall!

Get out of my head!

I can reboot you, but I won't lie: It's going to hurt.

We need to talk.

Are you near stairs?

Dogbert's Tech Support Dogbert says, <<<
Email me a list of the things you already tried.

It takes you two months to process my company credit card expense reimbursement.

Why must I be punished for your incompetence?
>>> Devil says, <<<
Apparently I'm awesome.

2010-04-27 * 
Wally says, <<<
I spent the entire week cleaning up the mess that Ted left after you fired him.

I didn't get fired. I'm right here.

I guess it's just his word against mine.

2010-04-26 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I cannot meet your arbitrary deadline, so the engineer's code requires me to kill myself with a lightsaber.

But lightsabers haven't been invented yet. The best I can do is annoy myself with a flashlight.

Could you do this in the hall?

Annoyance before dishonor!

Wally says, <<<
I need to spend the next year optimizing the WDNW system
>>> Boss says, <<<
I've never heard of the WDNW system.
>>> Wally says, <<<
You only hear about the systems that have problems.
>>> Wally says, <<<
If everything goes as planned, you'll never hear about WDNW again.
>>> Boss says, <<<
What does the WDNW system do?
>>> Wally says, <<<
It keeps our zeros and ones from accidentally forming tens.
>>> Boss says, <<<
That can happen?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Not on my watch.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
How's the 'Wally Does No Work' project?
>>> Wally says, <<<
The acronym helped.
>>>
2010-04-24 * 
Boss says, <<<
Good news! We won the bid to build a nationwide wireless network!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Bad news! We don't know how to build a nationwide wireless network!
>>> Boss says, <<<
It's wireless. How hard could it be to not install wires?
>>>
2010-04-23 * 
Boss says, <<<
Tina, I'm lending you to our executive offices to help writes press releases.
>>> Boss says, <<<
Your job will be to tell investors we're sitting on coal and trying to make diamonds.

I got it!

The company is happy to annouce that compaired to previous years, we improved our rate of revenue decline.

We've been doing great since we redefined success as a slowing of failure.

Moving on. Who has a status report?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I improved my rate of doing nothing.
>>>
2010-04-21 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Did you review the document I emailed?
>>> Coworker says, <<<
I don't read attachments.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Attachments say you don't care enough about my time to summarize a document.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I brought my pay stub to prove that my time is worth more than yours.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
Well-played.
>>>
2010-04-20 * 
The Boss says, <<<
What's taking you so long to fix the control management system?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Your leadership has taught me to give you laughably unrealistic timelines, then blame others when I miss deadlines.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You're not even doing that right.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I guess I need more of your leadership.
>>>
2010-04-19 * 
The Boss says, <<<
How long will it take to fix the bugs in our control management software?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Do you want a realistic estimate that will ruin your day, or a lie that will allow your ignorance and your happiness to lock arms and square dance to the next cubicle?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
That second option sounds festive.

I'm a pleaser.

You sort of hurt my feelings there.

Didn't your astrologer warn you about Scorpios?

Our policy is to put people in careers that match their looks.

Your botched nose job makes you too unconventional to be an engineer.
>>> Asok says, <<<
No!
>>> Woman says, <<<
Welcome to the art department.
>>> Man says, <<<
Man, I wish I was brave enough to get a snout.
>>>
2010-04-13 * 
Asok says, <<<
I probably shouldn't have gone to a veterinarian for my nose job.
>>> Asok says, <<<
But as an engineer, I value function over form, and the airflow is actually quite good.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You might be rationalizing a little.
>>> Asok says, <<<
I pity you with your inefficient nostrils.
>>>
2010-04-12 * 
Asok says, <<<
Our health plan doesn't cover nose jobs, so I used the market system to bargain for a good deal.
>>> Asok says, <<<
I learned that a veterinarian is just like a doctor, but cheaper.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Do you smell a squirrel?
>>>
2010-04-11 * 
The Boss says, <<<
The beta test went well. Thank you, Dilbert.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Now I'll have Tina add an impractical maintenance requirement to the manual and we're ready to go.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's standard procedure.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Say the user needs to lube the product ten time a day with the wax from a bear's ear.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
And say the warranty is voided if the device isn't properly maintained.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Is that legal?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's better than legal.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We're using the law to keep justice away!!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I feel sick.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
That's how you know it's working.

Does it whistle?
>>> Asok says, <<<
Sometimes, a little bit.
>>> Garbage man says, <<<
You're evolving into a corporate whistle-blower.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Are you lying?
>>> Garbage man says, <<<
Yeah, I just wanted to see it.
>>>
2010-04-09 * 
Asok says, <<<
It's a medical conditions called sympathetic Powerpoint proboscis. My nose grows when other people lie.
>>> Man says, <<<
I'm very concerned and interested in your condition, and not just because I'm trying to sell you something.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Please stop.
>>> Asok says, <<<
It might sting when I pull it out.
>>>
2010-04-08 * 
Doctor says, <<<
You have a wicked case of sympathetic Powerpoint proboscis.
>>> Doctor says, <<<
Your nose grows when anyone lies during a business presentation.

Sorry. The sales forecast seemed optimistic.

Wally says, <<<
Our servers were about to crash, so I wrote a suite of scripts to keep them running.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Your accomplishments are suspiciously hard to verify.
>>> Wally says, <<<
So, recapping what we know for sure, you're an inadequate verifier, and you can't rule out the possibility that I'm awesome.
>>>
2010-04-06 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
A technical writer misinterpreted the acronyms in my draft technical paper.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But that's okay because my pointy-haired boss will turn it into content-free bullet points and show it to idiots.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I like stories with lots of idiots in them.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Glad to help.
>>>
2010-04-05 * 
Tina says, <<<
I proofread your technical document despite not understanding a word of it.
>>> Tina says, <<<
I couldn't tell the acronyms from the typos, so I changed them all to whatever felt right.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You say we should migrate our lemon flutes to a hard flea?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Not all at once.

The Boss says, <<<
How's the CPG project coming along?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
How would I know?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You're leading that project.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I am? Since when?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I told everyone on the team two months ago.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm not on the team. You never told me.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Whatever, go tell the team you've been in charge for the past two months and see what they've accomplished.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Who is on the team?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I forget. I think one had dark hair. And another one was sad.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Don't tell them there's a duplicate project in another division.
>>> Wally says, <<<
You'll be okay. Just release the caring. Let it go.
>>>
2010-04-03 * 
Wally says, <<<
I asked for a transfer to our missile guidance engineering division.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Once they get to know me, they'll only give me unimportant tasks so I won't accidentally destroy a fishing village.
>>> Wally says, <<<
The great thing about unimportant tasks is that no one really cares if you do them.
>>>
2010-04-02 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I need training to use our new software.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Pretend we have a job opening for a technical expert in that field. Then ask applicants how they would do whatever it is that you need to do.
>>> Man says, <<<
Does you company provide training?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
'Provide' is a strong word.

Your pants have a tiny hole.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
These are my favorite pants!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll have to go with plan B.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Wear other pants?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's crazy talk.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll wear these and act as if the hole just happened.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Everyone knows you can't go home and change in the middle of the day.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll use a pants witness tracking application on my phone to keep track of who has seen the hole.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
If I play my cards right, I can get two or three more wearings out of my favorite pants.
>>> Wally says, <<<
All of this just happened.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Same here.

Dilbert says, <<<
Can you scan this document for me?
>>> Carol says, <<<
Is it important?
>>> Carol says, <<<
If it isn't important, you shouldn't bother me. If it is, the scanner will malfunction.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Is there no room for hope?
>>> Carol says, <<<
I keep mine in this empty candy jar.

The New VP The Boss says, <<<
Don't worry that I wanted your job, or that you have no experience in this field.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I won't try to sabotage you. In fact, I'll send you my best engineer to bring you up to speed.
>>> Vice President says, <<<
So... it's called 4G because it's G-G-G-Good.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Something like that.
>>>
2010-03-25 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Meet our new vice president of engineering.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We're lucky to have him despite his utter lack of experience in our industry.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Some might call him unqualified, but I call him exotic.
>>> Vice President says, <<<
You're over-selling.
>>>
2010-03-24 * 
CEO says, <<<
This rope is attached to a crony from my last CEO job.
>>> CEO says, <<<
Give it a good yank and reel him in. He's your new boss.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Is he qualified for the job?
>>> CEO says, <<<
Like a monkey with a hammer!

Dilbert says, <<<
It's a shoulder phone shaped like an old man's head. I invented it myself.
>>> Phone says, <<<
Let's make soup from her bones, just like the others!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I shouldn't have told Dogbert it has auto-answer.
>>> Phone says, <<<
Kiss me! Now!
>>>
2010-03-22 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
It's a cell phone shaped like an old man's head.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It sits on your shoulder so you don't look as if you're talking to yourself.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
People probably told Edison that his lightbulb was creepy too.
>>>
2010-03-21 * 
Henry says, <<<
Try rebooting.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Who are you?
>>> Henry says, <<<
I'm Henry the security guard. I'm trying to evolve into a new career.
>>> Henry says, <<<
I'm ignoring my real job while loudly giving technical advice to coworkers.
>>> Henry says, <<<
Eventually, people will start to see me as a valuable technical resource. Promotions will follow.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Do you know anything about technology besides 'try rebooting'?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Henry, who let the hobo take a sponge bath in the lobby fountain?
>>> Henry says, <<<
Try rebooting! Try rebooting!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
To fix a typo?
>>>
2010-03-20 * 
Coworker says, <<<
Alice, can you check this for technical accuracy?
>>> Alice says, <<<
Nope. Don't have time.
>>> Alice says, <<<
And no one else is qualified, so you might as well give up and look for a new job.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
That was a bit harsh.
>>> Alice says, <<<
You'd be less worthless if you fetched me some coffee.
>>>
2010-03-19 * 
Tina says, <<<
I can almost reach the paper jam, but a poltergeist is trying to drag me to the afterworld.
>>> Tina says, <<<
Maybe I can blind him with the toner cartridge. Ha ha! Take that! And that!
>>> Tina says, <<<
Gaaa!!! I can't feel my arms!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I only have one.
>>>
2010-03-18 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I hired a new poltergeist for our copy machine. Our old one got promoted to the server farm.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Wouldn't it be better to not have any poltergeists?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's a union thing.
>>> Tina says, <<<
May I please have my original back?
>>> Poltergeist says, <<<
I can't hear you. Put your face up close.
>>>
2010-03-17 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I've been asked to explain our technical issue in terms you can understand.
>>> Logan says, <<<
Good.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
THE SOFTWARE, IT NO WORKY!!!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
He was dense and touchy. It's a bad combination.
>>>
2010-03-16 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, explain to Logan the technical issue in terms he can understand.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Sure. What's his comprehension level? Are we talking human, squirrel or anvil?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Which one am I?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Don't make this awkward.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Did the squirrel go to a community college?
>>>
2010-03-15 * 
The Boss says, <<<
As lead software engineer, I give you the first unit of our ten thousand copy production run.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Wow! I wish we'd designed it with the features listed on the box. That would have been awesome.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
What?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll put this with the other reminders of how my life could have been excellent.
>>>
2010-03-14 * 

2010-03-13 * 
The Boss says, <<<
We're going to use CMMI. It's a model for developing a process to creat a framework.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Or it might be a process for creating a framework to make a model.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
There's no budget for training, so we'll be relying on guessing more than usual.
>>>
2010-03-12 * 
Wally says, <<<
I couldn't work this week because my workspace has bad Feng Shui.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I know Feng Shui is a real thing because our CEO hired a Feng Shui consultant to design his office.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Do you agree, or are you saying that our CEO is a superstitious simpleton?
>>>
2010-03-11 * 
Wally says, <<<
It's good Feng Shui to stand next to you because you absorb the workflow energy.
>>> Alice says, <<<
What?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I need someone to check all of these design specs before tomorrow morning.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Some people call it superstition, but I'm pretty sure it's a science.
>>>
2010-03-10 * 
Wally says, <<<
Who's the idiot that put a mirror in the lobby? That's bad Feng Shui.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I keep trying to work, but all of our workplace energy is getting reflected right back out to the sidewalk.
>>> Wally says, <<<
And the way your desk is angled is totally flipping me the chi bird!
>>>
2010-03-09 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Our scope needs to be calibrated. Do we have a budget for that?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We can save a few bucks by sending it to my friend, Elrod. He likes to tinker.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Everything about that idea is bad.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You should see the car he made from a bathtub.
>>>
2010-03-08 * 
Dogbert the Generic Manager Man says, <<<
We need more people on the project.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Figure it out. Work smarter not harder. Make a plan. Move some things around. Adjust priorities. Just get it done. Give me a status report.
>>> Man says, <<<
That did nothing but make me hate you.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I can replace you with someone who will pretend to be inspired.
>>>
2010-03-07 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, I need you to help with quality testing on Version 2.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm an engineer, not a quality tester.' Dilbert says, <<<
If I do quality testing, even temporarily, it will make me appear grossly overpaid.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That impression could work against me during my next performance review.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
A one percent difference in pay, compounded over the rest of my life, is big money.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Obviously my best strategy here is to offer resistance that's just short of insubordination.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So move on, little man! Scat! Go!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Too much?
>>>
2010-03-06 * 

2010-03-05 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
We realized our project can't work even if we execute it perfectly.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Our boss' plan is to go over budget, attract attention, and hope an executive cancels our project for his own political reasons.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Now do you agree that evil is the cure for incompetence?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Don't make me say it.
>>>
2010-03-04 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
The math clearly shows that our project won't work, even if we do everything right.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's embarrassing to cancel a project in the middle. Let's act dumb and hope someone in upper management cancels it for budget reasons.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Should I stop buying stuff?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You should buy twice as much.
>>>
2010-03-03 * 
Asok says, <<<
Alice, a horrible accident has given me a goat head. I need you to slap me so hard that I change species from the neck up.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Hold still, Asok. This might take a few tries.
>>> Two Hours Later Alice says, <<<
Dolphin is close! One more should do it.
>>>
2010-03-02 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Are you having any problems taking over Victor's project?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Nope. Smooth sailing so far.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Smooth??? It gave me a goat head!!!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
He asked if I had any problems. Wait for your turn, Asok.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Sorry.
>>>
2010-03-01 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Victor didn't leave us much documentation on his project.
>>> FZEEET! Dilbert says, <<<
I guess that's what he meant by 'still working on the goat head issue.'
>>>
2010-02-28 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, what did you accomplish this week?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I doubled my sales and made the cover of Time magazine.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
What?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Oh. Whoops. Sorry.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
For a moment there I confused my entrepreneurial fantasty life with my real job.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I run a parallel career in my mind. In that world, I'm the founder of a hot start-up.
>>>B<R>Dilbert says, <<<
It keeps my brain from fully realizing the horror of my actual career and trying to kill the rest of my body.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But to answer you original question, this week I made some powerpoint slides that have no particular use.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
GAAA!!! My brain is trying to kill the rest of my body!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Moving on...
>>>
2010-02-27 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Victor quit. I need you to take over his project.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Did he leave any documentation?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
No, but it's obviously some sort of glowing box. That should be enough to get your started.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Can you finish it by Monday?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If it's a nightlight, I can finish it by today.
>>>
2010-02-26 * 
Coworker says, <<<
Wally, I need your load calcs by Tuesday.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Remind me on Monday.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
You're hoping I won't remember to remind you. Then you'll say it's my fault.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
But I will remember, and I will remind you.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Good luck. Monday is my hiding day.
>>>
2010-02-25 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, meet our new account manager.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Hi.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
His job is solving a hodgepodge of problems that would bore a normal person to death.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We think his parents didn't let him have toys.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The first day is the easiest.
>>>
2010-02-24 * 
Alice says, <<<
You added the savings from my project to the budge for Ted's project.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Ted is a serial failer. You've destroyed in advance any hope that I might do something useful.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Maybe you could help Ted on his project.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Ow! Ow! Making it worse!
>>>
2010-02-23 * 
The Boss says, <<<
And I'll need that by the end of day.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I will gladly rush to meet your arbitrary deadline so my work can sit in your e-mail inbox until next week.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'm still within hearing distance.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Oops. You usually scurry away faster.
>>>
2010-02-22 * 

2010-02-21 * 
Coworker says, <<<
Can I get a rough cost estimate for the design phase?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
No. I don't trust you with numbers.
>>> Coworker says, <<<
What?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You're the kind of guy who will remove useful qualifiers and distribute a figure as if it is true in all cases.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Decisions will be made. People will get hurt.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
For everyone's sake, the safest thing I can do is make an annoying humming sound until you go away.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Hummmmm-mmmmmmmmm-mmmmm.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Half of life is making people go away.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Humm-mmmm
>>>
2010-02-20 * 
Asok says, <<<
The word on the street is that you can help me get my soul back.
>>> Garbage man says, <<<
Souls are totally fungible. Use this shamwow to absorb someone else's soul while you suck on the other end.
>>> Asok thinks, <<<
Why does this suddenly seem so wrong?
>>>
2010-02-19 * 

2010-02-18 * 
Asok says, <<<
Our ombudsman took my soul in exchange for a favorable view.
>>> Asok says, <<<
I'd like a transfer to marketing, where having no soul is widely considered an asset.
>>> Man says, <<<
I need someone who can make our product sound competitive without vomiting on his own copy.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Ooh! Ooh!
>>>
2010-02-17 * 
The New Ombudsman Asok says, <<<
How can you be impartial in my dispute with management when they are the ones paying you?
>>> Helen Fry says, <<<
Perhaps you have something of value that would allow me to see your side.
>>> Wally says, <<<
He's creepy without his soul, but I envy his carefree attitude.
>>>
2010-02-16 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Helen, we're looking for a new ombudsman. Your experience in the afterlife makes you an ideal candidate.
>>> Helen says, <<<
I'll take the job. But call me Mrs. Fry.
>>> Asok says, <<<
I have an issue with management.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Go to Helen Fry.
>>> Yes, I know it's an old joke
2010-02-15 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Technically, I was dead for a week. But I was evicted from the afterlife and had to come back.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The afterlife has a lot to teach us about management. I brought home a consultant.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I might be late with my status report.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Do you know what locusts taste like?
>>>
2010-02-14 * 

2010-02-13 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Do you think he's really dead?
>>> Alice says, <<<
I brought a wooden stake just in case.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Me too, just in case the afterlife rejects him.
>>> Wally says, <<<
It's legal, right?
>>> Alice says, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Spouse?
>>> Wife says, <<<
Did anyone think to bring a mallet?
>>>
2010-02-12 * 

2010-02-11 * 
Doctor says, <<<
He survived because his pointy hair cushioned the impact.
>>> Doctor says, <<<
Please resist the urge to fiddle with the cool machines that keep him alive.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Maybe we can make him smarter.
>>> Wally says, <<<
What's this do?
>>>
2010-02-10 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Our device will create enough pressure to gently push our boss's carcass out of the ductwork.
>>> FOOM! Captain says, <<<
This is Captain Sullenberger. Don't worry about the wing; I see a koi pond down there.
>>>
2010-02-09 * 
Boss is stuck in the ductwork. Dilbert says, <<<
The turbo blower kicks in after the lubricant cycle.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
We're sure he's already dead, right?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Help!
>>> Alice says, <<<
Arguably, the real crime here would be building a machine this cool and not using it.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Can anyone hear me?
>>>
2010-02-08 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Our pointy-haired boss is stuck in our building's ductwork and presumed dead.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
We can alert the proper authorities, or we can design a totally cool device to increase the duct pressure and propel his carcass into the stratosphere.
>>> Alice says, <<<
You had me at 'carcass.'
>>>
2010-02-07 * 
Man says, <<<
I need you to assign one of your engineers to my project.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Follow me and I'll show you your choices.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
This one is highly capable, but she's in such high demand that you'll be lucky if she ever returns a call.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
This one is aggressively unhelpful.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
This one will tell you that all of your plans are impractial and doomed.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
That one is an intern, so no one takes him seriously.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
My management theory is that nature makes everyone useless in their own way.
>>> Man says, <<<
I'm not useless.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Said the man who can't find a good engineer.
>>>
2010-02-06 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Where's our pointy-haired boss?
>>> Carol says, <<<
Dead.
>>> Carol says, <<<
I canceled his security clearance, so he went into hiding in the ductwork. By now he's probably gotten stuck and starved to death.
>>> Carol says, <<<
I plan to cremate his remains, but it might take a while; the thermostat only goes up to 85.
>>>
2010-02-05 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Asok, my security clearance was accidentally canceled. I need your help.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Maybe you could live in the ductwork, and forage for stale donuts after dark.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
How can I fit in there?
>>> Asok says, <<<
Try foraging as effectively as you manage.
>>>
2010-02-04 * 
The Boss says, <<<
My security access was accidentally canceled and now I'm a fugitive.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Can you teach me to be as useless as you are so I'm invisible for all practical purposes?
>>> Guard says, <<<
I hear breathing but it must be the HVAC system.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Be the cubicle.
>>>
2010-02-03 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Carol, you filled out Ted's termination documents wrong. You put my name in the box as the fired employee.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
My security access has been revoked. My phone is shut off, and my passwords are deactivated.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You need to fix this.
>>> Carol says, <<<
Security, I found the fugitive.
>>>
2010-02-02 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Our CEO wants to share his good fortune with all employees.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
He invites all of you to visit his winery and buy his non-award-winning wine at nearly retail prices.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
He asks that you not park your helicopters near his human chess board because it frightens the dwarves.
>>>
2010-02-01 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I hired a consultant to raise your morale by making you glad you're not him.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
No one loves me. My life is pointless. I eat old soap.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Now let the magic begin.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I feel good about not eating old soap.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
Cha!

Dogbert says, <<<
You're an incompetent CEO, but the Dogbert Investment Bank can help you pretend to unlock shareholder value.

I'll arrange an unwise merger so you can cash out while I collect an obscene commission.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
It's like a bribe, but instead of going to jail, a stranger will write a bestselling book with your name on it.
>>> CEO says, <<<
Can I read it?
>>>
2010-01-29 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Oh no. If I don't forward this e-mail to fifty friends, I'll die within a week.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I don't have that many friends! I need to make more friends, and fast!!!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What are you sending him now?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm upping it to sixty friends.
>>>
2010-01-28 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I can't tell the difference between urban legends and reality.
>>> Doctor says, <<<
I'll need your social security number so I can tell the government not to count any votes you cast.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You can do that?
>>> Doctor says, <<<
Here're some pills that look exactly like tic tacs.
>>>
2010-01-27 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
The urgent e-mail you forwarded to the entire company is a hoax.

Your e-mail was rather brusque.

You mean concise.

You owe me an apology.

I'm sorry that you don't know what brevity looks like.

Futurists say that when baby boomers start retiring in big numbers, you won't be able to fill critical job openings.

That's a risk I'm willing to take.

Dilbert says, <<<
And Russell will act as the WDG for our project.
>>> Asok says, <<<
WDG?
>>> Alice says, <<<
Worthless dumb guy. Every project has one.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
In a different context, Russell might seem totally competent.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But in any small group, the dumbest person always seems extra worthless.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Everyone else on the project is brilliant. That makes Ruseell seem like a chimp.
>>> Alice says, <<<
It's helpful to identify the WDG so we can discourage him from trying to contribute.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Does it hurt his feelings?

Me want banana!

It's hard to know.

Absolutely.

This isn't a complete waste of time.

Bummer. I only allocated time for things that are.

Wally says, <<<
We've never worked together so let me tell you how this will go down.

You'll expect me to contribute, and you will be disappointed at every turn. In the long run you will do everything yourself.

How do you stay employed?

DOn't make me call myself a genius.

Good things come to those who wait.

Really? There was thunder when he doubted you?

Maybe someone can help you quantify the value of your research and development work.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The only people who can quantify the value of researcg are liars and morons.

Morgan: <<<
The man with no communication skills Dilbert says, <<<
Did you get results from the stress tests yet?

Stress tests have to be performed under controlled conditions.

Has anyone ever explained to you the yes-no form of questions?

Is it my turn to talk?
>>>
2009-12-28 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Ask Morgan what type of materials he recommends we should use for the case.

Morgan has no communication skills. Everything he knows is locked in his skull and will never come out.

Is this going to look like my fault?

Quitter!

The Boss says, <<<
I invited silent Gary to help us decide on a technology direction.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We think he's a genius because he has a beard and he never speaks.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Gary, do you think we should use open source software for our support platform?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Here it comes. He's rubbing his beard and giving me creepy eye contact.
>>> THe Boss says, <<<
I detect a slight hint of disgust. It means Gary hates the idea! The Boss says, <<<
Yes, it's all so obvious now. This is the worst idea in the history of mankind.

Woman says, <<<
Please order a new stapler for me,
>>> Carol says, <<<
Did your old one break?
>>> Woman says, <<<
Only in spirit.
>>> Woman says, <<<
Every person who came into my cubivle picked it up and fiddled with it,
>>> Woman says, <<<
At first I would wipe off the cooties and try to forget.
>>> Woman says, <<<
In time my stapler became imbued with sorrow and desperation of every dead-ender that fondled it.
>>> Woman says, <<<
I covered it with a plastic bowl and taped it to the desk so no fumes can escape.
>>> Wally says, <<<
If you're wondering why your chair is warm, it's because I borrowed it for a meeting.
>>> Woman says, <<<
What's the biggest bowl you can order?

2009-12-19 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
This invoice is for twice as much as your bid.
>>> The Man says, <<<
Duh. You wouldn't have given us the job if we told you how much it was really going to cost.

If it makes you feel any better, all of the other bidders lied too. We're just better at it.

Wally, can you take a look at this?

I'd be delighted. What's your project charge code?
>>> Man says, <<<
It will only take a minute.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Are you suggesting that I lie about my time?
>>> Man says, <<<
It's only one minute.

By that line of reasong, it's okay to steal as long as you don't take too much.

Incidentally, I have to charge you for the time it just took to label you a thief.

Eventually your technical skills will become outdated.

Give me a call sometime.

Maybe.

I'll need to do a complete forensic analysis of your business card.

2009-12-10 * 
Man says, <<<
Can I send our requirements to your fax?

Absolutely.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll just travel back in time to 1995, when faxing was a good way to handle this sort of thing.
>>> Man says, <<<
You realize I'm your customer, right?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Until you spend all of your money on new fax machones.

The Boss says, <<<
If we work day and night, we can match our competitor's features within twelve months.

Well played.

I got the next one.

2009-12-08 * 
The Boss says, <<<
After eight months, senior management finally approved your project plan.

It's too late. All of the technology has changed and our competitors have leapfrogged us.

Maybe you could write a new plan.

Or we could get the same result by resubmitting this one.

Did you create a presentation on why you couldn't do the presentation you're supposed to be doing?

Yes

Wouldn't it have been just as easy to create the actual presentation?

I'm hoping to use this this one more than once.

I'm stepping down as CEO because I already milked all of the cash out of the this dying cow.

My replacement is a dried-up corpse. But don't worry; he's just a placeholder until a new CEO can be found.

Thanks for making me a failure.

I'll ask him to email you from his gmail account.

Dilbert, this is Ellen, your new project manager.

>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Wait...what?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Did you just tell me I'm going to lose no matter what I do?
>>> Ellen says, <<<
If you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen.

And by kitchen I mean the entire job market And the gene pool.

Now we're out of time, and my only memory of this meeting is that noise came out of your donut hole.

This is why I don't let you talk.

2009-11-26 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Carol, I want you to feel more emotionally invested in the vision and mission of the company.

Maybe I can inspire you with my leadership.

I feel like I'm wearing concrete underpants.

2009-11-25 *

We need more of what the management experts call 'Employee engagement.'

I don't know the details, but it has something to do with you idiots working harder for the same pay.

2009-11-22 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
My insolence safety zone has expanded.
>>> The boss says, <<<
Your what?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's a measure of how rude I can be without fear of consequences.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You have no budget to give me a raise, so I have no potential gain from acting professionally.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
And it would be inconvinient for you to fire a highly experienced engineer and try to bring a new one up to speed.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So from now on, when you ask me to do something stupid, which is most of the time...
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll roll my eyes, make a dismissive grunt and do this dance.

No offense, but you look more like a virus incubator than a vigorous hand washer.

So why don't you pull that death stick back up your sleeve and we can pretend this ugly incident never happened.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
And if it's not too much to ask, could you exhale toward things I'm likely not to touch?

Okay, now that the pleasantries are out of the way, what can I tell you about our new product line?

I need you to take these pills because the pharmaceutical rep is smoking hot.

Asok, I'm putting you in charge of pandemic contingency planning.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Calculate the impact on our business if 50% of our employees are unable to be productive.
>>> Asok says, <<<
That's twice as good as we're doing now.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Just make some slides that say it would be bad.
>>>
2009-10-23 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
It feels good when you volunteer to help others.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
that's why I talked some poor Elbonians into mowing our lawn for free. I want them to feel the joy of giving.

All I'm feeling is tired.
>>> Elbonian says, <<<
Try doing it faster.

I want to win a humanitarian award.

But I don't want to touch anyone who is sick. Or poor. Or unattractive.

I'm hoping to donate your time and the stockholders' money.

Sales are up!

The boss says, <<<
Wally, you didn't e-mail me your project status.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Did you check your spam folder?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Maybe you should check there before you besmirch my good name with your baseless accusations.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Did you send it?

Okay, I see how you're trying to turn this around.

I need you to write a white paper for an industry trade association.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Fine, but that will leave me with less time to work on my project.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Do the trade association stuff during your unproductive time.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What exactly is my 'Unproductive time'?
>>> The Boss says ,"It goes by many names, including sleep, leisure and healthy lifestyle.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If I do less of those things it will reduce the quality of my life below the point at which good hygiene has any utility.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I don't want to make out with your. I just want you to work harder for no extra money.

I spend too much time explaining the obvious.

I can't attend the meeting Tuesday because Barry thinks I didn't return his flash drive.

Hello? Human resources? Alice is being a bully.

And so it begins.

Carol says, <<<
Now what do I do?

So I hired your wife as a consultant despite the fact that she thinks 'Present value' is some sort of gift card.

And I wrote some legislation for you because you're a lazy thief.

Ha ha! Let's call that 'Access'.

2009-10-13 * 
the boss says, <<<
The company urges all of you to e-mail your congressman and support the bill that gives us pork projects.

If that bill becomes law, it will, in effect, transfer my tax money to you executives for your next obscene bonuses.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Don't you own company stock in your retirement account?

No, I'm only dumb enough to work here.

Did the executive steering committee approve my project?

We agreed on a predecisional draft framework for making the decision.

Does that mean anything?

It depends what you mean by 'Anything.'
>>>
2009-10-08 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Carol, I'd like to talk to you about your career goals.
>>> Carol says, <<<
My career goal is to take over the department by tricking you into a fatal accident, then telling everyone you're just working from home.
>>> The boss says, <<<
That's not right.
>>> Carol says, <<<
So you're saying I should set my goals low?
>>>
2009-10-07 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Tina, I just learned that your pay is 20% below the industry average for your job.

Denial is proof!

2009-10-05 * 
Alice says, <<<
It's funny that you're evaluating me.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Because I understand how to do your job, but you have no idea how to do my job.

For example, right now you're going to say something that doesn't help the stockholders.

Wally says, <<<
We find you interesting.
>>> The boss says, <<<
You do?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Oh, yes. Every little thing you do is interesting.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I didn't know that.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Hey, I just had an idea.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Maybe you should use twitter to leave us little messages about all of your days activities.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It would make us feel connected to our leader. And dare I say, more motivated.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Well, gosh. I suppose I could try it.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I already feel an improvement in my quality of life.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Where's idiot boy now?

I can't afford a big vacation this year.

This could turn ugly.

Retirement planning in a bad economy Wally says, <<<
Retirement planning is all about timing.

I'm planning to die from global warming on the same day I run out of money.

That's one more advantage of being frail. I figure an hour without sunscreen ought to do the trick.

Negotiating in a bad economy The Boss says, <<<
My company is so poor that we need a 20% price reduction or we'll go belly-up.
>>> Man says, <<<
My company is so poor that our only chance of eating involves throwing office supplies at low-flying birds.

Our health plan is 'Screaming.'

The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, I want you to develop a procedure for creating policies.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Do we have a policy on how to develop procedures?

I think someone wrote a white paper on that.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What's the procedure for finding white papers?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Maybe you could ask around.
>>> Later that night Woman says, <<<
So, what do you do?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I ask around to see if anyone knows about a white paper that talks about a policy for developing procedures to create policies.

You find that sexy.

Stop doing the Jedi mind trick!

Man says, <<<
Moving forward, we'll go after the low-hanging fruit at the end of the day.

I like the way you used humor to mock the vacuous way managers speak.

Which part was humor?

I'll just be quiet now.
>>>
2009-09-25 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
You're paying contractors to do work that I could do if I weren't always in unproductive meetings.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You could hire temps to attend the unproductive meetings for me, and fire the more expensive contractors.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Why don't I understand what you just said?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Because it made sense?
>>>
2009-09-24 * 
The Boss says, <<<
From now on, we will refer to all of our problems as opportunities.

One of your idiot spawn was playing with the oven and burned down your house.

2009-09-23 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
What kind of mood is he in?
>>> Alice says, <<<
Tired and fussy.

Also confused, bumbling, clueless, arrogant, short, bald and pudgy.

He's right behind you.

Add 'Angry.' Good luck.

2009-09-22 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Tina, you can't work at home anymore because the admins can't do it, and they're jealous.

I'm a technical writter. Why don't you explain to the admins that my job is different from theirs.

When you find a big kettle of crazy, it's best not to stir it.

2009-09-21 * 
Wally says, <<<
I did no work this week because I judged the user's specifications to be inadequate.

Should I continue to do nothing or do you prefer I use incomplete specs to produce useless designs?

The next thing you hear is something called leadership.

2009-09-20 * 
Strategy Meeting Man says, <<<
The weak economy is limiting our strategic options.
>>> Man says, <<<
I won't sugarcoat anything.
>>> Man says, <<<
Option one is a long slide to oblivion.
>>> Oblivion Man says, <<<
Option two is a death spiral.
>>> Man says, <<<
Our new company logo is a man getting sucked into a toilet.
>>> Man says, <<<
Our revised mission statememnt is 'Forage during daylight. Hide at night.'
>>> Man says, <<<
I'll pass out clubs, and you can decide among yourselves how to downsize by fifty percent.

This is all happening so fast.

CEO summit Dogbert says, <<<
Obviously it's illegal for companies to rig bids.

Ow. Ow. Ow.

Alice, I thought it was time for us to have a little mentoring session.
>>> Alice says, <<<
How does this make sense when I'm more capable than you in every imporant way?

Maybe we can skip the part where I say you need to be more confident and speak out at meetings.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Duh,

2009-09-15 * 
Dogbert the CEO Dogbert says, <<<
I can't tell if my pay is excessive enough.

Then Alice won't have enough resources.

I can only solve one problem at a time.

Did he solve your problem?

I'm going to say yes.

The Boss says, <<<
Gabe was downsized when his last employer had financial troubles. I was lucky to hire him.

Ted, your new responsibility is to keep the pigeons from defiling our ledges.

Are you hoping this awful assignment will cause me to quit?

Not at all.

Are you hoping I'll fall out a window?
>>> The boss says, <<<
Maybe you should stop guessing now,
>>>
2009-09-09 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
According to my analysis, all future ideas are already covered by over-general patents.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Our best strategy is to get out of this business and become trademark infringement lawyers.
>>> The boss says, <<<
I don't know how to be a lawyer.

That only matters if you take cases on a contingency basis.

The Boss says, <<<
Welcome to your first day on the job.

And the ones that have eyes like this got hired before we did drug testing.

2009-09-06 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Can you approve this change?
>>> Woman says, <<<
I'll have to run it by my corporate office.
>>> Woman says, <<<
And we're in merger talks, so they'll need to clear it with our future owners.
>>> Woman says, <<<
No one will know who should make the decision or what the right decision is.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
When do you think you'll have an answer?
>>> Woman says, <<<
Sometime between next week and whenever the earth is devoured by a gravitational singularity.
>>> Woman says, <<<
Meanwhile I will avoid your calls and e-mails by becoming a vapor.

You forgot the approval form.

2009-09-05 * 
The boss says, <<<
I hired my unemployed golf buddy to consult.

How did the industry standards meeting go? The boss says, <<<
Did you convince 83 companies to adopt standards that benefit only us while dooming the entire industry in the long run?

Or are you a complete failure?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Can I hear those choices again?
>>>
2009-09-01 * 
Industry Standards Meeting in Elbonia Dilbert says, <<<
Let's adopt my company's specs as the industry standard.
>>> Man says, <<<
Your specifications are weak, and so is your kung fu.
>>> From that day on, all standards meetings were held in the mud of Elbonia. Man says, <<<
Can't...Kick! Stupid...mud!
>>>
2009-08-31 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I need you to attend a three-day industry standards meeting in Elbonia.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Why Elbonia?
>>> The boss says, <<<
Because Elbonia is the worst place on Earth. The member companies don't want this to look like a boondoggle.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I guess three days won't be so bad.
>>> The boss says, <<<
You're not allowed to eat.

Asok, rummage through the piles on my desk and find yourself something to do.
>>> The boss says, <<<
Afterward, chastise yourself for not doing it the way I would have.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Even if you would have done it wrong?
>>> The boss, <<<
Especially then. No one likes a show-off.
>>>
2009-08-28 * 
Woman says, <<<
I judge potential mates by their cell phone apps. Hand it over.

You have an app that does nothing but hurl pirate insults. That is so stupid. This date is over.

Don't let the door hit you in the booty. Aaaargh!
>>>
2009-08-27 * 
The Boss says, <<<
And that was the last time I yanked a cable just to find out what would happen.

How many inane stories do I have to hear before I can speak to someone who knows something?
>>> The boss says, <<<
She's a story hater.
>>>
2009-08-26 * 
Performance Review The Boss says, <<<
You need to get better at anticipating problems.

Wally says, <<<
My productivity software turned on me.

It keeps crashing my computer. But that's okay because I don't need a computer to do my job.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Do you have any assignments that are sort of pre-industrial?
>>>
2009-08-24 * 
Wally says, <<<
I spent the first part of the week installing our new productivity software.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Then I used the rest of the week trying to make it interface with our time reporting system.
>>> Wally says, <<<
So far all it can do is tell me how much time I'm wasting in this meeting.
>>>
2009-08-23 * 
The boss says, <<<
Our next presenter is Dilbert.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I put together a slide show and video.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
While it's running, I'll perform a humorous rap song about the benefits of our product.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Then each of you will wear a funny hat and participate in a skit.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Later we'll enjoy a ventriloquist who dresses in a beaver suit and threatens to eat his dummy.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
We'll top it off with a trivia contest, prizes, fireworks in the atrium.

What can you do in two minutes? We need to catch a plane.

My goal is to be the premier provider of imaginary expertise.

Dogbert the CEO Dogbert says, <<<
We're getting into the financial services game.

Can you give me reliable investment advice?

Yes, as far as I know.

2009-08-20 * 
the Boss says, <<<
I need you to keep this information to yourself. Can you do that?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Well, obviously I'd have to weigh the benefits of sharing it versus the risk of getting caught.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's sort of a dumb question if you think about it.

2009-08-19 *

I found a less expensive delivery service for our oversees business packages.

The first day of any new system is always a problem.

2009-08-17 * 
The boss says, <<<
I just forgot what it's like to be one of the little people.

It's liberating because I have no empathy for your suffering.

And how is this different?

Now I have a reason.

Dogbert the CEO Dogbert says, <<<
Gas up the company jet, flunky. I'm going skiing in Aspen.

Using the corporate jet for a vacation sends the wrong message.
>>> Man says, <<<
And you can't ski in the summer.

What message do forty planeloads of snow send?

Man says, <<<
Your order will only cost about $20,000.

No it won't.

We both know you're intentionally underestimating the true cost to get the sale, you lying sack of spit.
>>> Man says, <<<
You're not supposed to say that out loud.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Is it okay if I imagine a bear attacking you?
>>>
2009-08-12 * 
Wally says, <<<
If I don't have enough time to do things right, should I just do nothing?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Or do you prefer that I miss deadlines, or do shoddy work, or pray for divine intervention?
>>> The boss says, <<<
I want everything fast and perfect.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Can I buy a prayer rug?
>>>
2009-08-11 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I see my job as giving you the information you need to make the right decision.
>>> Carol says, <<<
I see your job as e-mailing me links to web sites full of stale and incomplete information.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Can we go back to pretending I'm useful?
>>> Carol says, <<<
Sure. I'll give you a pity listen.
>>>
2009-08-10 * 
Wally says, <<<
It takes an average of five people to approve any action in this company, and at any given time, three are on vacation.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Should I violate our company culture of consensus building, or just sit around and do nothing for lack of buy-in?
>>> The boss says, <<<
Did you mention flailing around in futility?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I was hoping you forgot that option.
>>>
2009-08-09 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Our new data center is complete.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The only wrinkle is that the power company won't give us the kilowatts we need.
>>> The boss says, <<<
What are our options?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Well, we can run the servers without air conditioning.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Until they melt into a toxic blob.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Then we can turn the building into a museum that celebrates poor planning.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Or we could all quit our jobs and eat bugs to survive.
>>> The boss says, <<<
Let's go with the toxic blob, but we need to call it something else.
>>> Man says, <<<
Convergence!

Wally, I need load calcs in an hour.

No problem! Unless my computer keeps crashing like it did all morning.

I'll ask someone else.

I am begging you to let me help!
>>> Asok thinks, <<<
Wow!
>>>
2009-08-07 * 
Asok says, <<<
According to the book of Wally, I should use something called 'Preemptive guilt' to avoid work.

Exactly. If you wait until after you get an assignment, it is already too late for guilt.

Stress killed both of my parents. The doctors said they worked too hard.

Did you tell a customer that you're not allowed to talk to customers?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Yes.

You fool! That makes us look lame!

What was I supposed to do when she asked me a question?

Did you have access to scissors?

Woman says, <<<
Hey, engineer, can I ask you a question?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm not allowed to talk to customers. We believe that honesty impedes sales.

I think you just impeded.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Oops.

2009-08-04 * 
The boss says, <<<
Our VP of Sales asks that you answer customer questions through the sales reps, not directly.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Is the goal to reduce the timeliness of my answers or just to filter out the accuracy?
>>> The boss says, <<<
Why are you like this?
>>> DIlbert says, <<<
Should I tell you or the sales reps?

I want you three to put together a teamwork award program.
>>> Wally says, <<<
If we do a good job, can we give ourselves the award?
>>> The boss says, <<<
No.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Great. Now I have no incentive to do a good job on this award thing.
>>> The boss says, <<<
Keeping your job should be all the incentive you need.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Then why does anyone need a teamwork award?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Let's just slap something together and randomly nominate people.
>>> Asok says, <<<
I got a teamwork award and yet I feel no different.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Yup.

Evil director of human resources Catbert says, <<<
With your skills, you have a variety of career options.

Etcetera.

The boss says, <<<
I hired an arrogant guy with a huge forehead. He's on your project.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Great. Everything this guy says will seem more annoying than usual because of his huge forehead!

I keep a wine glass with me at all times. I'm a foodie.

Case in point!

Dogbert the CEO Dogbert says, <<<
I'm nearing retirement, so fire the research and development group.

Can you review my letter to this customer who complained?

Good writing should never be predictable.

How much will it cost to develop our next generation product?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It will cost whatever you put in the budget.
>>> The boss says, <<<
How much should I put in the budget?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Ask for the biggest number you think will get approved.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If we get a lot of money we can build something great.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If we don't get much money we can build something lame, and compensate for the lack of quality by lying more vigorously than usual.
>>> The boss says, <<<
I'll aim low so I don't get yelled at during the executive budget meeting.

I remember the time when this sort of thing would haunt me.

I've been asked to cut the fat out of this department.

If the department has fat in it, that's a symptom of bad management. Maybe you should fire yourself.

I wasn't asking for suggestions.

Geez, way to be critical during brain storming.

I was once like you: Angry at every idiot in the world.

I created a school so they'd give me money while I insulted them.

2009-07-20 * 
Catbert says, <<<
I'm sending you to an anger management class because of your recent outburst against your boss.

When one is being abused by a figure of authority, anger is a healthy and appropriate response.

Right. We want less of that.

The boss says, <<<
Did you see my suggestions for your presentation?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Yes, I rejected them.
>>> The boss says, <<<
They aren't optional.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Then why do you call them suggestions?
>>> The boss says, <<<
Sometimes I call things the wrong names to improve morale.
>>> DIlbert says, <<<
You should just say what you're thinking. I can handle the truth.
>>> The boss says, <<<
FIne. Make all of the changes I want, you ignorant hump.
>>> The boss says, <<<
And do it now while I mock you with sleep noises.

Baaaa! Baaaa! Baaaa!

Maybe your first way was better.

No one will ever love you!

I'm not an overpaid speed bump!

My fact-checker will need to see your pay stub.
>>>
2009-07-15 * 
Tina says, <<<
I've been asked to chronicle your rise to management for the company newsletter.
>>> Tina says, <<<
So far, I have the story of how your father was a barrel-shaped moron who married a blind woman.

But it could have been the other way around. I'm mostly guessing.

Lucky guess.

Dilbert, I want you to audit the software we have on our systems.

Why?

So we know what we have.

Who will use the information?
>>> The boss says, <<<
It's just important to have.
>>> DIlbert says, <<<
It will be out of date before I'm even done.
>>> The boss says, <<<
Do your best.

The best way to compile inaccurate information that no one wants is to make it up.

Asok, the company isn't growing, and no one is quitting in this economy.

I can't give you a bonus because another division had huge losses.

2009-07-05 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I'm worried that I won't get a raise this year.
>>> The boss says, <<<
You shouldn't worry about that.
>>> The boss says, <<<
You should worry that you might lose your job in the next round of layoffs.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I should worry about that???
>>> The boss says, <<<
Well...probably not.
>>> The boss says, <<<
It makes more sense to worry about the entire company going out of business.
>>> The boss says, <<<
And that's nothing if the global economy collapses.
>>> The boss says, <<<
Maybe you should worry that the only viable livelihood of the future invokes cannibalism.

Not so much.

We're going into the executive recruiting business.

But the economy is so weak that there aren't any job openings.

That's why we're also going into the executive coaching business.

We'll give our clients bad advice, and get them fired.

Then our recruiting division will offer to fill those jobs.

My base pay will be one dollar per year. The rest will be stock incentives.

Pretend you don't know that.

A lot of people think crime is a bad thing.

I've decided to dabble in crime. I nees some henchmen. Are you in?

How can we be sure you'll have enough money to pay the lease?

You could check our financials.

I'm pretty sure your financials are as fraudulant as ours.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Good point. Maybe we could ask trusted third parties to vouch for us.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Do you trust any third parties?
>>> Man says, <<<
Not since my financial advisor put my retirement savings in a ponzi scheme and had an affair with my wife.

No, if we leave out any details, you'll think we made the wrong decision.

It's simple I take your money and then use math to turn it into my money while destroying the overall economy.
>>> Man says, <<<
Is that legal?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
More so than you'd think.
>>> Man says, <<<
What's in it for me?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
My inflated claims will give you false hope.

That way you won't stress out until after you retire and discover you're penniless.

But I...
>>> Bonk! Ugh! Man says, <<<

>>> Wally says, <<<
It's a little thing I call experience.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Once a week, I e-mail our pointy-haired boss and ask him a question.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I make the question so complicated that it hurts his brain.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Ow! Ow! Ow!
>>> Wally says, <<<
He'll spend the rest of the week avoiding me so he doesn't need to think about it.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Meanwhile he seeks out team players and hammers them with new projects.
>>> Asok says, <<<
So... experience is a form of evil?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Not always. Some people squander it.
>>>
2008-11-15 * 
A woman says, <<<
Tell me an interesting story.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Our spam filter became self-aware and ordered us to build an army of killer robots. My coworker, Alice, punched them all to death.
>>> The woman says, <<<
I'm not even in that story.
>>>
2008-11-14 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Our robots went bad. They're on a murderous rampage.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I'll take care of it.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Hey, Alice. Guess who says your hair is unfashionable and you're overpaid? Robots.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Little help, please. My fist of death is stuck.
>>>
2008-11-13 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Our robots have gone on a murderous rampage.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'll put that issue on the agenda for our next meeting.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Ha ha! You're an issue!
>>>
2008-11-12 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Do you really think it's a good idea to build killer robots just because our spam filter ordered you?
>>> FZEEET! Dilbert says, <<<
What's the worst thing that could happen?
>>>
2008-11-11 * 
Carol says, <<<
Our spam filter became self-aware. It rewrote our business plan.
>>> Carol says, <<<
It wants us to build an army of indestructible robots.
>>> Carol says, <<<
And the new org chart is out. It looks like you report to... the microwave.
>>>
2008-11-10 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Our spam filter has become self-aware
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's managing the company by deciding which messages to allow through.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
All I'm getting is e-mail about hair growth and... ooh, another lucky guess.
>>>
2008-11-09 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Our project plan will follow the usual arc.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Phase one will be unwarranted optimism supported by delusions of competence.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
In phase two, the obstructionists will slither out of their lairs and try to smother our dreams.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Ignorance and envy will fuel rumors that get repeated until they morph into common knowledge.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Resources will be allocated based on misinformation and favoritism.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
And requirements will drift until the project is both undesirable and impossible.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That brings us to the second week.
>>> Asok says, <<<
I want my unwarranted optimism back.
>>>
2008-11-08 * 
The CEO says, <<<
Our plan is to beg for a government bailout.
>>> The CEO says, <<<
It's good for everyone because otherwise our bloated carcass will blot out the sun.
>>> The CEO says, <<<
We have cookies and lemonade in the back.
>>>
2008-11-07 * 
A woman says, <<<
i saw this shirt and I had to get it for you.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
We've had one date and you're buying me a a shirt? That's kind of creepy.
>>> The woman says, <<<
What?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Is it made from your ex-boyfriend's skin?
>>>
2008-11-06 * 
Catbert: <<<
Evil Director of Human Resources Catbert says, <<<
I've seen your resume and I sense desperation.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Our janitor recently passed away, so I have a job for you.
>>> A man says, <<<
You want me to clean toilets?
>>> Catbert says, <<<
No, I want you to bury the janitor.
>>>
2008-11-05 * 
A man says, <<<
I'm here for an interview in a conference room named...
>>> The man says, 'Where Hope Goes to Die'
>>> Carol says, <<<
It's the first one past 'The Rectangle of Futility.'
>>>
2008-11-04 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Does anyone know the root cause of our project's failure?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm a determinist, so I'd have to say the problem goes back to the origin of the universe.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Why are you like this?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
My cubicle destroyed my illusion of free will.
>>>
2008-11-03 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Your resume is lame, but you're tall, so you must be competent.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You're hired. Let me show you around.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'm what you call a good judge of people.
>>>
2008-11-02 * 
Carol says, <<<
Where are you going with that fish?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm going to microwave it.
>>> Carol says, <<<
That will stink up the office and make it impossible for anyone else to enjoy life.
>>> Carol says, <<<
Isn't there something else you could eat?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm not going to eat it. I just like to microwave things that smell bad.
>>> Wally says, <<<
After I stopped caring about my job performance, it was a slippery slope to complete sociopathy.
>>> Wally says, <<<
It's a liberating feeling. I can't remember the last time I felt bad.
>>> Carol says, <<<
Do you have an extra fish?
>>>
2008-11-01 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Change is good.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Then why do most startups fail?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I only take questions at the end.
>>> Someone says, <<<
There's more?
>>>
2008-10-31 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I'd like to thank our CEO for coming to our meeting.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You said everyone would be wearing costumes today.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm unreliable.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I kind of hate you now.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Geez, who moved your cheese?
>>>
2008-10-30 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Ted, you can keep your job but your office is being moved 50 miles away.
>>> Ted says, <<<
Gosh, I guess I could drive another 50 miles each way.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
How about a hundred?
>>>
2008-10-29 * 
Wally says, <<<
Some people see me as a loser who achieves nothing.
>>> Wally says, <<<
In reality I am a winner who knows how to set realistic goals.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So you're sort of a genius.
>>> Wally says, <<<
And yet my only goal was to have a pulse.
>>>
2008-10-28 * 
A man says, <<<
We need a plan for making our plan.
>>> The man says, <<<
Then we need to plan the plan's planny plan.
>>> A police officer says, <<<
Have you seen this man?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Sigh. There goes another employee of the month.
>>>
2008-10-27 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Your project is not sexy.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'm transferring all of your funding to a project that totally arouses me.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
That's something they don't cover in business school.
>>>
2008-10-26 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I call my invention a carbicle.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's 50% car, 50% cubicle, and 100% awesome.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
it is the ultimate expression of human efficiency.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Rarely does an engineer get to create something so perfect that it can never me improved.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I hesitate to use the word 'genius,' but I won't protest if others do.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You should cram a bed in there.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Shut up.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You shut up.
>>>
2008-10-25 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Can you give me some comments on my business plan?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Sure.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Your plan is a hodge-podge of unwarranted optimism encased in an impenetrable fortress of buzzwords.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Would you like to read it?
>>> Wally says, <<<
There's that unwarranted optimism again.
>>>
2008-10-24 * 
A woman says, <<<
The quality of your graphics casts a dark shadow across all of your work.
>>> The woman says, <<<
Your logo stimulates the parts of my brain responsible for revulsion and dread.
>>> The woman says, <<<
ONLY DEATH CAN RELEASE ME!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So... bad graphics... what else?
>>>
2008-10-23 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Our graphics department made this logo for my project.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have badgered them to finish quickly.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Please don't judge my competence by my logo.
>>> Two people say, <<<
Too late.
>>>
2008-10-22 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Our graphics department is too busy to help me and won't approve outside services.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
They're forcing me to fail so they can justify a bigger budget next year.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If you need me, I'll be in my cubicle trying to imagine what futility doesn't feel like.
>>>
2008-10-21 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
And I need you to design a logo for our prototype.
>>> A man says, <<<
We don't do that. We're the graphics support department. Talk to the graphics production department.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
They create logos?
>>> The man says, <<<
No, they tell people we do it.
>>>
2008-10-20 * 
A man says, <<<
Can your phone do this?
>>> Alice says, <<<
Let me see.
>>> BAM! BAM! BAM! Alice says, <<<
Can your hammer do that?
>>>
2008-10-19 * 
Asok says, <<<
Anyway, that's what I think should be done.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
IDEA SQUIRREL!
>>> Asok says, <<<
WHAT? WHAT?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The idea squirrel steals your ideas and treats you like a nut for saying they were yours!
>>> Asok says, <<<
What do I do now?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Your only hope is to tackle him before he gets to our boss's office.
>>> Asok says, <<<
GAAA!!!
>>> The Idea Squirrel says, <<<
Grrr...
>>> Someone says, <<<
Ow! Ow! Ow!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Why is the squirrel that always has great ideas fighting with that nut?
>>>
2008-10-18 * 
Dogbert the Philanthropist Dogbert says, <<<
If I give a man a fish, he will eat for one day.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
But if I inspire him by my opulent lifestyle and my squiring of supermodels, he might try harder.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You can't stop giving.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
It's like a curse.
>>>
2008-10-17 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
I am stepping down as CEO so I can spend more time with this money I stole from this hellhole.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I need you and you to carry huge bags of cash to my helicopter.
>>> Wally says, <<<
The worst part is that if he ever writes a book, I'll probably buy it.
>>>
2008-10-16 * 
Dogbert the CEO Dogbert thinks, <<<
Start some rumors, spread some lies...
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Wait for the stock to pop up... exercise my stock options... bang!
>>> Dogbert thinks, <<<
How did people steal before computers?
>>>
2008-10-15 * 
Dogbert the CEO The Boss says, <<<
Our investors are not happy that you bought a helicopter.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Or that you only use it to keep birds off the building.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Or that the parking lot is filling up with beaks and feathers.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I can't please everyone.
>>>
2008-10-14 * 
Dogbert the CEO Dogbert says, <<<
I earn 420 times what you make. That means I'm 420 times smarter.
>>> A man says, <<<
Actually, it means the system is deeply flawed.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
If you were 420 times smarter, you wouldn't be contradicting your boss right now.
>>>
2008-10-13 * 
Dogbert the CEO Dogbert says, <<<
My salary is 400 times more than yours.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
My goal is to jack that up to 410, maybe 420.
>>> A woman says, <<<
I hate you for this.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
So you admit you're selfish?
>>>
2008-10-12 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Would it be okay if I talked to a potential customer?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
No. You're not in sales. I need you to focus on your project.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I already talked to them. Is it okay if I arrange a demo?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
No. Only the sales teams arrange demos.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I already gave the demo.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Is it okay if I convince them to buy $40 million of our product?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
No, because you won't succeed.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Here's their letter of intent.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You shouldn't slap yourself now.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Yes I... wait. Nice try.
>>>
2008-10-11 * 
A man says, <<<
We invested $100 million in your solar technology and all you developed was this ham sandwich.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
If you feed that ham sandwich to a rickshaw driver, he can pedal you all over town.
>>> The man says, <<<
You call that solar power?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Try growing a pig without the sun.
>>>
2008-10-10 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Our investors want to see the solar panels you invented.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I didn't invent any solar panels.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Show them something else. They won't know the difference.
>>> A man says, <<<
It looks like a ham sandwich.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I was assured that you're stupid.

Vijay the venture capitalist Dogbert says, <<<
We're going into the solar panel business.

Pretend you didn't see that when I negotiate my equity.

2008-10-08 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
There is an ugly rumor that I sold your brains to cannibals and your spirits to demons.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
BU-WA-HA-HA-HA HA!!!
>>> Alice says, <<<
Did you?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You seem a bit unclear on the whole bu-wa-ha-ha concept.
>>>
2008-10-07 * 
Alice says, <<<
A corporate raider bought the company and sold off all the assets.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Well, he can sell our assets but we still have our brains and our spirits!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
And the brains go to Mutobu the Impaler. Our next auction is for their spirits.
>>> BAM
2008-10-06 * 
An Elbonian says, <<<
A corporate raider has offered to buy our company for nine dollars.
>>> Another Elbonian says, <<<
We should ask for more.
>>> The first Elbonian says, <<<
He's a tough negotiator.
>>> The first Elbonian says, <<<
Now it's only eight dollars?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
And I want you to do something in your hat.
>>>
2008-10-05 * 
Dogbert consultant Dogbert says, <<<
I've been hired to identify the most important goals of your organization.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
how will you do that?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I'll ask you what they are, and you'll tell me.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Then I'll put your answers on a PowerPoint slide.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Next week I'll show you the slide and tell you to focus on your most important goals.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Then I'll get paid. Because that's MY most important goal.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
WOO-HOO! CHA-CHING! CHA-CHING! CHA-CHING!

I lead by example.

Wally is the new VP of Finance A troll says, <<<
I moved all of our cash to a secret offshore bank.
>>> The troll says, <<<
But I forgot to write down the account number. Or the password. Or the name of the country.
>>> The troll says, <<<
And... I'm not entirely sure it was a bank.
>>> Wally thinks, <<<
First day, not so good.
>>>
2008-10-03 * 
Wally says, <<<
I got an Elbonian makeover. Now no one can tell I'm bald and chinless.
>>> Wally says, <<<
The hat even makes me look taller. I think this will help my career.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Take a minute to drink this in.
>>> An Elbonian says, <<<
I just found my new VP of finance!
>>>
2008-10-02 * 
Cow supervisor A cow says, <<<
Try not to think of me as a cow who happens to be your supervisor.
>>> The cow says, <<<
Think of me as your bovine overlord, the usurper of your position in the food chain.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'd be lying if I said that didn't make it feel kind of cool.
>>> The cow says, <<<
Say you'd die for me!
>>>
2008-10-01 * 
The cow supervisor A cow says, <<<
I overcame a lot of bias against cows to get this job.
>>> The cow says, <<<
People think that a cow with strong leadership skills is just a jerk.
>>> The cow says, <<<
Is that what you think, baldy? Huh? Do you? Do you?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Um... I'll say no.
>>>
2008-09-30 * 
An Elbonian says, <<<
I assure you that your new Elbonian management will not discriminate against non-Elbonians.
>>> Someone says, <<<
Doesn't your belief system hold that all non-Elbonians are on the same level as livestock?
>>> The Elbonian says, <<<
Someone is starting off on the wrong hoof with his new supervisor.
>>>
2008-09-29 * 
The Boss says, <<<
An Elbonian company bought our company yesterday.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
They promise they won't discriminate against non-Elbonians.

Hey, hatless spawn of Satan's bowels, put a head on this.

Hi, I'm a customer of your commercial sales division.
>>> <<<
The man says, <<<
I heard you would be the best person to answer a technical question...
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I don't work in that division.
>>> The man says, <<<
I know. It's just a quick question.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If I tell you something different from what the commercial division tells you, I'll get in trouble.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But I'll also get in trouble for not helping a customer.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
My safest course of action is to fake my own death.
>>> The man says, <<<
You're a bad actor.

It isn't polite to insult the dead.

The sky's the limit.
>>>
2008-09-26 * 
Director of Green Andy says, <<<
We should rethink our product packaging.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
What's wrong with it?
>>> Andy says, <<<
We're using endangered species.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Only the unpopular ones.
>>> Andy says, <<<
Still, it's a lot of packaging for a DVD.
>>>
2008-09-25 * 
Director of Green Andy says, <<<
Turn off your computer while you're thinking.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's stupid.
>>> Andy says, <<<
if it weren't stupid, you wouldn't need me to tell you to do it.
>>>
2008-09-24 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Andy has been appointed our director of green.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Director of green? How do you get a job like that?

You start by being the director of something else and screwing it up.

A man says, <<<
How can you say my trouble ticket is resolved when I still have the problem??!

2008-09-17 * 
Tina says, <<<
And then she acted as if I have no right to my opinion!

Is the point of this conversation to convey useful information, or just to make yourself feel better at my expense?

Maybe not.

Is there any particular reason this time?

At my level of management I don't have the authority to approve anything important.

If I don't reject proposals, there's nothing for me to do.

If I do nothing I'll get fired. I might never get another job. I could starve to death.

So I have to reject everything you propose or else I might die.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What am I supposed to do now?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Can you rephrase that question in the form of a proposal?

Catbert: <<<
Evil Director of Human Resources Catbert says, <<<
We're instituting a mandatory stretch period every day.
>>> Asok says, <<<
This is surprising because human resources usually doesn't care about employee wellness.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Phase one is just to get you good and flexible. Phase two involves a new place to tuck your head.
>>>
2008-09-05 * 
A man says, <<<
Alice, when will I get your cost estimates?
>>> Alice says, <<<
When will your one eyebrow turn into two?
>>> The man says, <<<
Is that the ghost of the guy who used to have your job? He makes you look bad because he was always helpful.
>>> Alice says, <<<
If you're so helpful, tell me how to kill you.
>>> The ghost says, <<<
Dang... try garlic and a shop-vac.
>>>
2008-09-04 * 
A ghost says, <<<
Hello, Alice. I'm the ghost of the popular employee who once did your function.
>>> The ghost says, <<<
My body has gone to a better job, but my spirit remains to remind everyone how mean you are in comparison.
>>> The ghost says, <<<
Nice try, but you can only kill me with kindness.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Gaaa! Gaaa! Gaaa!
>>>
2008-09-03 * 
The Boss says, <<<
We will be adopting the best practices in our industry, just like everyone else.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If everyone is doing it, best practices is the same thing as mediocre.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
STOP MAKING MEDIOCRITY SOUND BAD!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Sorry.
>>>
2008-09-02 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Alice, there's no budget to give you a raise, but I'll give you something that is just as good.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I promise that if you quit on me I will give you a bad reference and you will never work again.
>>> Alice says, <<<
How is that just as good as a raise?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Try to see it from my point of view.
>>>
2008-09-01 * 
Job Interview The Boss says, <<<
Would you tell me bad news even if you knew it would upset me?
>>> A man says, <<<
Yes, I would.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Why would I hire someone who hates me?
>>>
2008-08-31 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Wally, where do you think you're going?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's only four o'clock.
>>> Wally says, <<<
What a strange thing to say. Did anyone care how many hours a week Beethoven worked?
>>> Wally says, Genius can't be scheduled.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Judge my by my accomplishments, not the number of hours I spend at the office.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Okay, fine. What did you accomplish today?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I just taught you how to be a better manager.
>>> Wally says, <<<
What? Did you think it was going to happen on its own?
>>>
2008-08-30 * 
Alice says, <<<
Today is Shelly's birthday. We should make her feel special.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Do you still have that random stack of birthday cards you got on sale last year?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm all over it.
>>> Alice says, <<<
She likes pets. The closest thing you have is an elf.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Draw whiskers on it.

These things can't be rushed.
>>>
2008-08-28 * 
Company Lawyer Dilbert says, <<<
Can you turn a simple agreement into impenetrable gibberish?
>>> The lawyer says, <<<
Absolutely. I can also leave a sour taste in everyone's mouth and make you want to choke me with my suspenders.
>>> The lawyer says, <<<
If you exercise and eat right, you might still be alive when I finish it.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Good enough.
>>>
2008-08-27 * 
Wally says, <<<
This week I focused on ergonomics.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I kept my guts moist so they wouldn't bunch up.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I don't think that is ergonomics.
>>> Wally says, <<<
tell that to my dried-up spleen.
>>>
2008-08-26 * 
Sitting There Wally thinks, <<<
Leaning? What's that got to do with sitting?
>>> Wally thinks, <<<
I remember when Sitting There meant something. I'm going to give them a piece of my mind.
>>> A voice says, <<<
Frankly, we ran out of things to say about sitting.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I find that hard to believe!

Our spies stole this laptop from an employee named Dilbert.

Ha ha! We will find his company's secrets and use them!

heh-heh.
>>> Six months later An Elbonian says, <<<
Do you remember mittens? I loved having mittens.
>>> The other Elbonian says, <<<
Shut up!!

Asok says, <<<
I'm going to a seminar that will teach me how to make a million dollars!
>>> Alice says, <<<
It's a scam.
>>> Asok says, <<<
How could you know that?
>>> Asok says, <<<
I haven't even told you the name of the seminar!
>>> Asok says, <<<
You can't be sure it is a scam if you know none of the details.
>>> Asok says, <<<
You just want to crush my hopes so I become like you.
>>> Asok says, <<<
But it won't work because I have dreams! I won't be a bitter and broken cynic like you two!
>>> Asok says, <<<
I'll have the last laugh after I pay my nominal fee and learn how to 'Turn a Hundred Dollars Into a Million.'
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
invest $100 at 5% interest and wait 190 years. Thanks for coming.
>>>
2008-08-23 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Elbonian spies stole my laptop and all of our confidential data.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But don't worry, because I placed a virus in there that will destroy their morale and their hope.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I believe you call it your 'business plan.'
>>>
2008-08-22 * 
Wally says, <<<
As requested, I fit my presentation on one PowerPoint slide.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I had to use all of the white space, but I think it was worth it to fit everything on one page.
>>> Wally says, <<<
It's actually only one bullet point, but it's a long one.
>>>
2008-08-21 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Our charitable giving has caused some unintended consequences.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It sparked a hobo war. The east side of the city is in flames.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Well, it could be worse.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
They tasted human flesh, and they like it.
>>>
2008-08-20 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
My company sent me to give money to a hobo. It's our way of helping the local community.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm authorized to give a million dollars to one of you.
>>> A hobo says, <<<
How do you decide which one?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Maybe you could fight for it.
>>> The other hobo says, <<<
Say 'go.'
>>>
2008-08-19 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I want to improve our reputation in the community by donating money to the needy.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Find me a photogenic hobo who could use a million dollars.

I'm looking for a hobo who could use a million dollars.
>>> A man says, <<<
Sorry, we're tramps.

2008-08-18 * 
The Boss says, <<<
We're rethinking our policy of allowing shorts during the heat wave.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Until we sort that out, I've been asked to cover you with a tarp.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I should have fought for eye holes.
>>>
2008-08-17 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Find out what the users want before your build it.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Why are you explaining my job to me as if I'm an idiot?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's called managing.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I assume you're dumb because you work harder than I do and earn less money.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
And my boss would fire me if I just sat in my office and did nothing.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
So I wander around and say obvious thing to you idiots until quitting time.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Then I go home and eat until my underpants don't fit.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Thanks for asking.
>>>
2008-08-16 * 
The Boss says, <<<
The company will be using less air conditioning to reduce expenses.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
To compensate, we're loosening up on the dress code. Shorts will now be allowed.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm not going to update my shorts wardrobe until I know this will last.
>>>
2008-08-15 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I never have enough information to make an informed decision.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
But that's okay because I'm a good judge of people.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Can you approve this?
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
Baby puncher.
>>>
2008-08-14 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I don't need to know the details. Just give me the high altitude view.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
From a high altitude we're all a bunch of termites trying to eat the same log.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Maybe drill down a little more.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The termites hate each other.
>>>
2008-08-13 * 
A woman says, <<<
How long have you been addicted to ogling online job postings?
>>> Alice says, <<<
It started when I realized my current job is like a dung beetle trying to mate with an epileptic cow.
>>> The woman says, <<<
That imagery is disturbing.
>>> Alice says, <<<
I know, right?
>>>
2008-08-12 * 
Alice thinks, <<<
I'm addicted to our online job posting system.
>>> Alice thinks, <<<
It helps me fantasize about having a job I could enjoy.
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
This can't be good.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Oooh!
>>>
2008-08-11 * 
The Boss says, <<<
My smartest employees keep disagreeing with me.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Which is weird because great minds usually think alike. They must be slipping.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Sometimes I think I'm not arrogant enough.

2008-08-10 * 
The Boss says, <<<
We can't move forward until you get input from Allen.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
And that won't be easy. Allen is an amorphous cloud of gas.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
He once was human like us.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Allen was afraid to give his opinion or make a decision.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
He put so much effort into avoiding commitment that his molecules stopped binding together.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Now he exists as nothing but a subtle odor near the copier room.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
How can I get his input?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Don't make me micromanage you.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Allen? Is that you?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Sorry.
>>>
2008-08-09 * 
Wally says, <<<
My security software kept insisting that I download critical updates.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I didn't have time to do all that, and I couldn't risk using my computer without critical updates. It was a no-win situation.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Did you accomplish anything this week?
>>> Wally says, <<<
What part of 'no-win' is confusing you?
>>>
2008-08-08 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
I cooked the books by assuming your pension fund will earn 15% per year.
>>> Pension Fund 15% Dogbert says, <<<
Technically you aren't crooks, just optimists.
>>> Tweet! Mmph! Tweet! Dogbert says, <<<
If you hear a whistling noise, that would be your soul escaping through your nose.

2008-08-07 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
Welcome to 'Dogbert's Financial Bakery.' How may I abuse you?
>>> A man says, <<<
We shipped zero units this quarter. Can you cook our books?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Of course.

Will anyone know?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Sometimes the footnotes smell like actual feet.

Catbert: <<<
Evil Director of Human Resources Catbert says, <<<
Our concern for wellness is related to your job performance.

Obviously you won't be getting an ergonomically correct chair any time soon.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
And feel free to type as hard as you want.
>>>
2008-08-05 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
Employee wellness programs save money in the long run, but that does you no good.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You need a program that can save you money now, when it makes a difference.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
A hellness program? I don't like the sound of that.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Try to see the big picture for once.
>>>
2008-08-04 * 
Wally says, <<<
Health problems and absenteeism are a huge cost to this business.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
So?
>>> Wally says, <<<
So give me a raise, or I'll eat unhealthy food and avoid all forms of exercise.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You already do those things.
>>> Wally says, <<<
How could you possibly know that?
>>>
2008-08-03 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Ted, your position is being eliminated.
>>> Ted says, <<<
What? You never told me there was anything wrong with my performance!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's not about your performance. Your position is being eliminated.
>>> Ted says, <<<
Well, that seems mighty convenient.
>>> Ted says, <<<
This way you can replace me without explaining why I never got a bad performance review.
>>> Ted says, <<<
is this just a trick to make you feel less awkward while firing me?
>>> A woman says, <<<
I thought you said he'd be gone by now.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Is there any comfort in knowing your replacement is totally hot?
>>>
2008-08-02 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I've been away from work so long, I wonder if anything has changed.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You weren't here when we moved to new cubicles so your coworkers picked one for you.
>>>
2008-08-01 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
How much do I owe you in legal fees for helping me win my lawsuit?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
My fee is 100% of the jury award plus I get to call you names that sound worse than they are.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That doesn't seem fair.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You're an analog.
>>>
2008-07-31 * 
A man says, <<<
We find in favor of the plaintiff dude.
>>> The man says, <<<
There was some discussion about which one is the plaintiff - the complainy guy or the weasel.
>>> <<<
The man says, <<<
But we were unanimous in not wanting to be here any longer.
>>> Another man says, <<<
Aye!
>>>
2008-07-30 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
Where were you on the day that Dilbert was pushed out of your office window?
>>> The CEO says, <<<
I was directly behind him, in this position, yelling 'die, die, die!'
>>> The CEO says, <<<
The first question is just practice, right?
>>>
2008-07-29 * 
Jury selection Dogbert says, <<<
You with the big eyebrows, are you as dumb as you look?
>>> A man says, <<<
I'm not sure. I don't remember what I look like.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Okay, you're in. And on an unrelated noted, I'm the only person who ever loved you.
>>>
2008-07-28 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Will you represent me in my lawsuit against my CEO?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Under one condition.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You must do everything I ask, without question or hesitation.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What if you tell me to do painful things for your amusement?
>>> <<<
Dogbert says, <<<
If?
>>>
2008-07-27 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Asok, I won't have time to hold your hand on this project.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You need to work independently.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
And by that I mean you should imagine what I would tell you to do, then do it.
>>> Asok says, <<<
But... I can only imagine you telling me stupid things.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Holy Shiva! This is a trap!
>>> Asok says, <<<
My choices are failure or insubordination.
>>> Asok says, <<<
My only hope is that I'm in one of those hidden camera shows and this is all a big joke on me.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Find anything?
>>> Asok says, <<<
Can't... stop... looking.
>>>
2008-07-26 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Did you deliver those legal papers to my CEO?
>>> Bob says, <<<
No, I served him.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It means the same thing.
>>> Bob says, <<<
How could it?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
No, really, it does.

Now I feel bad about double faulting.

2008-07-25 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I need to find a support group for people who have my same problem.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Type 'thrown out of a fifth floor window by a CEO who will escape justice.'
>>> A man says, <<<
look who doesn't have a broken leg. Do you think you're better than us?
>>>
2008-07-24 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I need some sympathy.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I'm so sorry your face looks like that.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
My face isn't injured.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Well, excuse me for being thorough.
>>>
2008-07-23 * 
A woman says, <<<
Maybe later you can give me a back rub with your good hand.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I don't have a good hand. But one of my elbows doesn't hurt too much.
>>> The woman says, <<<
I feel like you're not even trying to make me happy.
>>>
2008-07-22 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
My CEO threw me through a fifth-floor window. I'd like to press charges.
>>> A policeman says, <<<
Your CEO? Do you think he would hire me to do security on his yacht?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
No.
>>> The policeman says, <<<
Would he hire me if I club you with this stick-thing?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Maybe.
>>>
2008-07-21 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
My moral compass has healed. Can I keep my new job in management?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'd like to use my position of power to narrow the gap between executive and worker pay.
>>>
2008-07-20 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Why have you failed to accomplish any of your objectives this quarter?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Well, I took the objectives you gave me and put them into three categories.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The first group includes physical impossibilities, such as being in two places at the same time.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The second group includes logical impossibilities, such as anticipating unforeseen problems.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Last, we have the illegal objectives, including industrial spying and consumer fraud.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So I spend my time doing things that are both important and legal, while hoping you wouldn't fire me for it.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Whoa, what just happened? Is it my imagination, or did I just win this conversation?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It was my imagination.
>>>
2008-07-19 * 
Dilbert's moral compass is damaged. Dilbert says, <<<
My new job is to make employees feel miserable and helpless.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Here's a chart that shows the sort of women that are attracted to men at various salary ranges.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Trophy wives are at the top, obviously, and down in your range we have the carnival skanks.
>>>
2008-07-18 * 
A man says, <<<
It has come to my attention that your moral compass is damaged.
>>> The man says, <<<
I'm promoting you to vice president of making employees feel miserable and helpless.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's an actual job?
>>> The man says, <<<
It doesn't happen on its own.
>>>
2008-07-17 * 
A woman says, <<<
I hear your moral compass is damaged and you're being groomed for upper management.
>>> SPLOISH! Dilbert says, <<<
Was that wrong? Because I can't tell.
>>>
2008-07-16 * 
Catbert says, <<<
I can't put you on the management fast track until I confirm that your moral compass is broken.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
A nun, a CEO and a scientist are in a burning building. You can only save one of them. Which one do you save?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Is there time for a bidding war?
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Oh, you're good.
>>>
2008-07-15 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
My doctor says everything is fine except for the part of my brain that controls morality.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Gasp! The management prophesies are true. You must be the one they call...
>>> Catbert says, <<<
THE NATURAL?!!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
He glows from within.
>>>
2008-07-14 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Where am I? What happened?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Someone hit you with a rock.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
The swelling in your prefrontal cortex will make you care less about hurting people, thus making you a natural leader.
>>> <<<
Dilbert says, <<<
There's also a bump on the back of my head.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
That's so you don't remember who threw the rocks.
>>>
2008-07-13 * 
Asok says, <<<
Wally, how do you keep up with all of the changes in technology?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Chasing knowledge is a fool's game, Asok.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I use experience to answer questions without the burden of knowledge. Observe.
>>> A man says, <<<
Wally, if we upgrade our servers, would that solve our network problem?
>>> Wally says, <<<
If the problem is the servers, yes.
>>> The man says, <<<
I'll ask someone else.
>>> Wally says, <<<
There goes another satisfied customer.
>>>
2008-07-12 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I'm thinking about getting a master's degree in business so I can get promoted to management.

How long does it take to learn how to be less useful?

Three years of night classes.

Hold still and I'll save you three years.

2008-07-11 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Your salary is already above the midpoint for your pay range.

Excuse me while I remove a sock to explain what will happen to your pay going forward.

Let's say the sock is inflation and my hand is your paycheck.

Dogbert the Time Management Expert Dogbert says, <<<
I can tell by looking at you that it doesn't matter what you do with your time.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I don't think you'll be curing cancer if I give you a few extra hours per week.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
In fact, it would probably increase your chances of getting it.
>>> A man says, <<<
Are we done? I need a smoke?
>>>
2008-07-09 * 
Dogbert the Time Management Expert Dogbert says, <<<
Never put time into an activity that has no potential benefit.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
For example, why bother putting on makeup if you're going to wear that hideous outfit?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
That's like knitting a sweater for a dead squirrel.
>>>
2008-07-08 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
Welcome to Dogbert's seminar on time management and evolution.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
The key to good time management is skipping un-important tasks.

In module two, I will show you that everything you do is unimportant because your genes are a dead end.
>>>
2008-07-07 * 
A man says, <<<
Alice, did you make those code changes yet?
>>> Alice says, <<<
No. I find your specifications to be vague and uncompelling. They are a breeding ground for ennui.
>>> The man says, <<<
Is there any way I can cheer you up?
>>> Alice says, <<<
Maybe if something awful happened to you.
>>>
2008-07-06 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Some of us are going for a drink after work. Would you like to join us?
>>> A woman says, <<<
Nice try, but I know how this scam works.
>>> The woman says, <<<
You're trying to lull me into a false sense of activity with a group activity.
>>> The woman says, <<<
But we both know the other people will mysteriously never show up.
>>> The woman says, <<<
Then it's just you and me on what looks like a date.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
How many people do I have to invite before you believe some of them will show up?
>>> The woman says, <<<
Well, given the disparity in our levels of attractiveness, I'd say thirty-five.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Can do.
>>> The woman says, <<<
Not one other person showed?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I only invited women who are more suspicious than you.
>>>

Alice says, <<<
You know that antimatter version of yourself that you brought to work?

I killed him with a cup of coffee. I think he enjoyed it. Because he's, like, opposite.

But enough about me. How's your day going?

Anti-Dilbert says, <<<
I'm the antimatter Dilbert. If my thin film of matterscreen washed off, I would come in contact with matter and be annihilated.

In my alternate universe, the one we call Wally is a billionaire entrepreneur and adventurer.

You're like his Oprah.
>>> Anti-Dilbert says, <<<
Hold me.
>>>
2008-07-01 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I created an anti-Dilbert, but I don't know how to prevent him from being annihilated by matter when he leaves the vacuum.

If you don't know how to do it, and he's the anti-you, that means he knows how.

2008-06-30 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
Whatcha got going there?

It's a particle accelerator?

Our CEO decided to eliminated employee bonuses.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The savings will be used to produce an in-house movie to inspire you.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Inspire us to do what?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
For starters, we'd like you to be happy about being underpaid.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Our fun-loving executives will wear festive costumes and sing about the virtues of poverty.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The movie is called 'The Sounds of No Money.'
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The premiere is on our CEO's yacht. He wants all of you to be there.
>>> Asok says, <<<
We're invited to his yacht?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The yacht runs on whale oil, so bring a harpoon.

Filling in for the Pointy-Haired Boss A man says, <<<
Does your department need its entire budget this year?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
no, we'll waste most of it on empire building and appearing to work on trendy things.
>>> The man says, <<<
All in favor of cutting this guy's budget in half?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I call do-over! Do-over!
>>>
2008-06-27 * 
A man says, <<<
I need you to attend a meeting for your boss while he's on vacation.
>>> The man says, <<<
I plan to bully you into making decisions that are bad for your department.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's almost as if you have no respect for me.
>>> The man says, <<<
Yeah, almost.
>>>
2008-06-26 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Is everything okay since I left for vacation?
>>> Carol says, <<<
Better than ever.
>>> Carol says, <<<
Counterproductive policies have been eliminated, and we are no longer victims of ignorance.
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
Man, I don't like the sound of that.
>>>
2008-06-25 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I'm in charge while our pointy-haired boss is on vacation.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I expect each of you to be professional and productive during this time.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Nice lying.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I practiced in front of a mirror.
>>>
2008-06-24 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I'm in charge while our boss is on vacation. When can you format some reports for me?
>>> Carol says, <<<
I'll send you a link to a widget that shows the temperature in Satan's fireplace. When it hits 32o Fahrenheit, I'll get right on it.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
And I was worried that the power would go to my head.
>>> Carol says, <<<
Not as fast as this stapler will.
>>>
2008-06-23 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I'm off for two relaxing weeks of well-earned vacation.

Attention all employees. The stain is on the move. I repeat, the stain is on the move.

Relaxing just got harder.

2008-06-22 * 
Asok says, <<<
Wally, what do you plan to do after you retire?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Retirement is for losers, Asok.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Winners keep their jobs but stop caring about the quality of their work.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I have no stress, free coffee, and I get paid, too.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Watch how this works.
>>> Ted says, <<<
Wally, can you give me some cost estimates for my project?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm too busy. Ask Dilbert.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Doesn't this make you a worthless leech on society?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm pretty sure the winner in that example is the leech.

We've installed surveillance cameras to monitor your work.

It might seem like an unconscionable assault on your privacy, but you'll get used to it.

I'm already a little bit used to it.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Used to what?

2008-06-19 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
I'm from the Dogbert Rumor Control Service.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
People are saying Ted is an exotic male dancer on weekends. I know it isn't true because he spends all of his free time in a terrorist training camp.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Isn't that worse?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I get paid per rumor. It's not a perfect system.
>>>
2008-06-18 * 
Dogbert's Rumor Control Ted says, <<<
I need to squash a workplace rumor that I'm an idiot.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I charge $10 for each false rumor and $1,000 for any rumor I decide is true.
>>> Ted says, <<<
Sounds fair.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Really? That just cost you $1,000.
>>>
2008-06-17 * 
Carol says, <<<
I heard a rumor that you think a monkey could do my job.

Do you think a monkey could fling this corporate newsletter at your head?

Unh!!!

Is this a trick question?
>>>
2008-06-16 * 
Catbert says, <<<
Ted, I've decided to gossipsize you.

I'm spreading vicious rumors about you until you feel compelled to quit.

People are too smart to...

PIPE DOWN, BABY EATER!

2008-06-15 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Ted, I have a funny story for you!
>>> Ted says,"Why am I filled with a sense of foreboding?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
So I was trying to print a long document, hee-hee!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
But when I went to the printer, the document wasn't there!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
For the next three days I kept trying and trying, but the document never showed up at the printer!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It turns out I was checking the wrong printer. The right printer used $80,000 worth of paper that week.
>>> Ted says, <<<
And how does this affect me?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You and paper just became an either-or situation.
>>>
2008-06-14 * 
A man says, <<<
My tiny company can't survive if you insist on paying our invoices late.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You should have thought of that before you decided to become a tiny company.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Come here for a second.
>>> A man says, <<<
Please... not the flyswatter.
>>>
2008-06-13 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I've decided that your tiny company will give us an interest-free loan.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
There's no paperwork to sign. We'll just pay your invoices late while snortling.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
This is the part where you realize your negotiating leverage is limited.
>>> A man, <<<
I demand no snortling!

Dogbert the Media Trainer Dogbert says, <<<
Let's try a mock interview to see how you respond under pressure.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Are you a stinking weasel trying to pass as human?!!!
>>> A weasel says, <<<
What gave it away?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Honestly, it was a lucky guess.
>>>
2008-06-11 * 
Dogbert the Media Trainer Dogbert says, <<<
Carefully choose your words when talking about the company's future.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
For example, avoid comparisons to Abe Lincoln at Ford's Theatre, 'Circling the drain,' and anything involving flies.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
And never, ever refer to the company as any kind of sandwich you wouldn't want to eat.
>>> A man says, <<<
That's my favorite one!
>>>
2008-06-10 * 
A man says, <<<
We've decided to write off 47 billion dollars in bad loans.
>>> A man says, <<<
You might think this is my fault, but in actuality it is all caused by poor regulatory oversight.
>>> A man says, <<<
Who is in favor of those guys taking a big pay cut? Anyone?
>>>
2008-06-09 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Asok, you never mentioned any issues this quarter, so I assume you didn't do any work.

Ooooh, lordy lord! Our vendors are incompetent and our customers are suing us!!!

Why can't you be more like that guy?

Someone please kill me!

Dogbert says, <<<
I decided to produce a reality show about your life.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
The cameras will follow you around and capture all of your failures and humiliations.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Why would I agree to that?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Because you suffer from the dull ache of insignificance.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You can only fill the horrible void in your soul by fathering children or being famous.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Maybe I prefer to have children.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
And maybe you prefer to flap your ears and fly to Mars.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Do you see where I'm going with this?
>>> BOP A cameraman says, <<<
Sorry.

2008-06-07 * 
The Boss says, <<<
The executive steering group took your recommendation to cancel all design projects.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What?!! I didn't recommend that!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Uh-oh. Your poor communication skills have sowed the seeds of our destruction.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Gaaa!!!

Am I an unclear communicator?

six o'clock.

2008-06-06 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
You won't read my technical report so I summarized it in this complicated slide.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If you stare at it long enough you will either experience the illusion of understanding it or be too embarrassed to admit you don't.

Do you have any questions to betray your ignorance?

Is the triangle thing mad at the tube?

I took a class on being less useless. Now I see the world in a different light.
>>> Wally says, <<<
For example, I recognize these staff meetings as colossal wastes of time, but there's nothing I can do about them.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Now my helplessness makes my uselessness seem unimportant.
>>>
2008-06-04 * 
Wally says, <<<
I took a class to learn how to be less useless.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Now I carry twice as many coffee cups wherever I go.
>>> Carol says, <<<
Does that make you work faster?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I only have two hands.
>>>
2008-06-03 * 
Catbert says, <<<
Wally, I enrolled you in a program to cure uselessness.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Your classmates will be a glass hammer and a bag of nothing.

Can I borrow a pen?
>>> A bag says, <<<
Dude, no arms.
>>>
2008-06-02 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Wally, in the past month you've blamed your lack of productivity on seven dead people and three who never existed.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I used to blame living coworkers but it made the meetings awkward.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Whose fault is that?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Here comes the awkward part.
>>>
2008-06-01 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I can't give you a raise because your project is behind schedule.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's because the vendor delivered defective equipment.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It is your job to anticipate that sort of problem and head it off.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It isn't possible to anticipate and head off every improbable event.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Well, you could have picked a more reliable vendor.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You told me to use this vendor because the sales guy took you golfing and bought you a hat.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Well, you should have seen that coming and burned down all hat factories a year ago.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
He would have bribed you another way.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
That's what lazy people say.
>>>
2008-05-31 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Wally, are you busy?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Yes, I'm reading the 'In Memoriam' section of our company newsletter.

When you're done, can you compile the beta test results?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Sure. Just as soon as I get the data from... Larry.

2008-05-30 * 
Catbert says, <<<
I will use role play to evaluate your management potential. Catbert says, <<<
Imagine you are a turtle and you are being attacked by a hawk.

That's better than I expected.

Thanks.

>>>
2008-05-27 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I didn't work on your request this week because my computer is broken and my company is too cheap to replace it.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I tried to borrow one, but the people I work with are a bunch of selfish tools.
>>> A man says, <<<
Maybe I shouldn't take you on sales calls.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So I built a tiny fort out of coffee stirrers.
>>>
2008-05-26 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Maybe I could use your laptop until we have the budget to get me a computer that works.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I might need my laptop.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I already need it.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I need you to stop needing it.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Well played.

2008-05-25 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Go to human resources for a psychological evaluation.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Why??? Have I said anything that is abnormal?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You're an engineer. Everything you say is abnormal.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Question one: How many bodies are hidden in the crawl space under your house?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If they are hidden, how would I know?
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Well, maybe you would smell them.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Not if they were wrapped in heavy plastic and sealed in concrete.
>>> Wally says, <<<
How'd it go?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Not so good.
>>>
2008-05-24 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
My computer is broken. I need a new one.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We don't have the budget.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Do things that don't require a computer until the next budget cycle.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Like churning my own butter?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You make it sound creepy.
>>>
2008-05-23 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I think my girlfriend is only dating me to get free tech support.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I'm very surprised you think that.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Because it's unlikely?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Because it shows self-awareness.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
She might grow to love me.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
And... back to normal.
>>>
2008-05-22 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I fixed your satellite dish connection and tuned your surround sound system. Now can we go on our date?
>>> A womany says, <<<
That was our date. In ten minutes I'm dating a guy who will replace the water filter in my refrigerator.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I can do that.
>>> A woman says, <<<
You're welcome to stay and fight him for it.
>>>
2008-05-21 * 
A woman says, <<<
Dilbert, when you come over tonight, wear your toolbelt.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Because it's sexy?
>>> A woman says, <<<
That would be between you and the squirrel that keeps chewing the cable from my satellite dish.
>>>
2008-05-20 * 
A woman says, <<<
I'm not attracted to you, but I'd like to date you for one month.
>>> A woman says, <<<
That should be long enough to resolve any tech support issues on my home computer, cell phone and home theater.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Would there be any kissing?
>>> A woman says, <<<
What kind of girl do you think I am?
>>>
2008-05-19 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I worked all night to finish the assignments on time.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Toss it on the pile.

I'd feel better if you used a different choice of words.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Plop it on the top.
>>>
2008-05-18 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Alice, I can't give you the maximum raise because you don't respect other people's differences.
>>><br />Alice says, <<<
Why are you discriminating against me for my intolerance?
>>><br />Alice says, <<<
If I am intolerant for some genetic reason, then I can't help it.
>>><br />Alice says, <<<
And if I'm intolerant because I can't learn to be otherwise, then obviously I have a learning problem.
>>><br />Alice says, <<<
Why is it acceptable for you to be an idiot but not acceptable for me to notice it?
>>><br />Alice says, <<<
You need to start appreciating me for my intolerance!
>>><br />Alice says, <<<
And while I'm at it, allow my to mention that a monkeys seat cushion has better views than what I'm looking at right now.
>>><br />The Boss says, <<<
I'm not quite sure where to go with this.
>>><br />Alice says, <<<
Ooh! Oooh! I have a suggestion.
>>>
2008-05-17 * 
A woman says, <<<
Before I get too invested in this conversation, tell me what you do for a living.
>>><br />Dilbert says, <<<
I'm one of three people my boss asked to do the same assignment because he deems all of us unreliable.
>>><br />A woman says, <<<
This is why I ask.
>>><br />Dilbert says, <<<
The other two people are total losers.
>>>
2008-05-16 * 
<<<
Do you have the approved vendor list?
>>> <<<
Hmmm, Alice and Asok asked for that list too.
>>> <<<
Are you one of three people assigned to the same project because your boss believes none of you are reliable?
>>> <<<
Maybe.
>>> <<<
Hmmm, and you're the last one to ask for the list.
>>>
2008-05-15 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
We just discovered that you assigned the same project to both of us a month ago.
>>><br />The Boss says, <<<
Sometimes I do that when I think neither of you has more than a 50% chance of doing something right.
>>><br />Asok says, <<<
Hey, I just discovered something.
>>><br />The Boss says, <<<
Or 33.3%

This seems like a good time to take a personal half-day.

I have a good feeling about this.
>>>
2008-05-13 * 
Asok says, <<<
Our boss asked me to make some copies. But I fear doing such a menial task will brand me as unimportant.
>>><br />Asok says, <<<
I was hoping you could make the copies for me since your career is already a bloated cadaver.
>>><br />Asok says, <<<
If I am reading your body language correctly, you are wondering 'staple or no staple?'
>>>
2008-05-12 * 
I need someone to make ten copies of this document. <<<
Is there any risk that performing this task will make me appear less valuable?

2008-05-11 * 
<<<
Wally, I can't open that file you e-mailed.
>>> <<<
Sounds like you need to upgrade your viewer application.
>>> <<<
Which means you'll probably have to upgrade your operating system.
>>> <<<
You'd better add some ram while you're at it.
>>> <<<
But it probably makes no sense to upgrade your old computer. This is a good time to get a new one.
>>> <<<
How do I get a new computer?
>>> <<<
It's easy. I'll send you a file that explains it.
>>> <<<
Are you sending corrupted files to people again?
>>> <<<
Only if I think they deserve it.
>>>
2008-05-10 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I cut the quality control budget to free up funds to increase our sales force.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So your strategy is to sell a larger volume of defective products?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The quality will be fine. The tests will just take longer.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So...It's an antique thing?
>>>
2008-05-09 * 
<<<
The company decided to invest a billion dollars based on your stupid made-up numbers.

You've crushed my dreams of a better tomorrow. Now my life is a cold, wet slide to oblivion.

I finally made a difference at work.
>>> <<<
how many victims?
>>>
2008-05-08 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I didn't have any accurate numbers so I just made up this one.
>>>Dilbert says, <<<
Studies have shown that accurate numbers aren't any more useful than the ones we make up.
>>>The Boss says, <<<
How many studies showed that?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Eighty-seven.

2008-05-07 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Use the CRS database to size the market.

That data is wrong.

Then use the sibs database.

That data is also wrong.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Can you average them?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Sure. I can multiply them too.

2008-05-06 *

I acquired the musky scent of failure. Do you have anything that can get rid of it?

Try being successful at something important.

I work in a fabric-covered box.

Okay, then try rubbing this behind both ears.
>>>
2008-05-05 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Can I could on your cooperation for the next phase of the project?
>>> Woman says, <<<
No.
>>> Woman says, <<<
You emit the musky scent of failure. Women can detect that sort of thing.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Would a bath fix it?
>>> Woman says, <<<
How long are you willing to stay submerged?
>>>
2008-05-04 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, I want you to the be lead developer on this project.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Don't check the other developers' work because it will make them angry.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's okay, as long as they do good work.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Actually, they do bad work. Very, very bad work.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You are setting me up for certain failure.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
If work were easy, no one would pay you to do it.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Okay. I'll go through the motions while hoping the project gets canceled for other reasons.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Keep up the bad work, Carl.
>>> Carl says, <<<
Who told you?

2008-05-03 * 
Man says, <<<
You must be Dilbert. I'm the new guy on your project team.

What's that foul stench?

It's the stink of failure. It follows me around from project to project.

How do I get if off?!!

You can dilute it by shaking hands.

2008-05-02 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Our alternative fuel division has found a way to turn fresh water into fuel!

Wouldn't that turn the world into an uninhabitable wasteland in the long run?

Not if someone finds a way to turn oil into water.

Dogbert says, <<<
I thwarted the hostile takeover bid, but your CEO died in the process.

I recommend we cancel our planned merger.

I came up with it all by myself.

My subordinates, who have a healthy fear of losing their jobs, had nothing to do with it. Right?

We're not worth the oxygen we breathe.

I don't even know why I'm here.

I asked because it's an awful idea.

You said I was stealing credit for a good idea, you lying liar!!

Asok, you have violated the Indian Institute of Technology's ban on the use of telekinesis in the ungifted world.

Where were you this morning?

Beware the power of stink eye. Intern. I will make you bow to my will!

You have a call from the Indian Institute of technology. It's someone from the department of things you shouldn't do.

Dilbert says, <<<
I have an issue.

Lordy lord.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
No one in the department wants to be left out of the decision making.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But no one is willing to make a decision.

As a result, all of my problems are perpetual.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Can you do something about that?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I can appear to be concerned. How's this expression?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Can you combine that with some impractical advice and unwarranted optimism?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm frequently thwarted, but rarely disappointed.

Ted The Generic Guy says, <<<
thanks to marketing. Sales have increased 100%!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Question: are you asking a room full of engineers to be excited about a big percentage increase over a trivial base?

You leave me no choice but to give you the stink eye.

Ow! Ow! Make it stop!

I have never been kissed.

Alice says, <<<
You let Dilbert have two flat screen monitors in his cubicle.
>>> Alice says, I'm not the least bit envious, but I should point out that a worker with two monitors should be able to do twice as much work.

Did you know there are some advantages to having only one monitor?

Who has some success to share at our 5-minute daily huddle?

Everything.

Loud Howard insists on using his speak-phone in his cubicle. You have to do something about it.

I'll move him to a private office that just became available. Problem solved.

Alice, I'm hoping we can work together on this project in the spirit of cooperation.

I'll have some ideas, and you'll have some ideas, and together we can pick the best ones.
>>> <<<
Sure, that's one approach.
>>> <<<
But I prefer to exhale deeply and roll my eyes while you prattle.
>>> <<<
Then I will verbally demolish your ludicrous ideas, and dismantle your mistaken self-image as a competent man.
>>> <<<
The carnage will create a striking contrast for the warm, clear glow of my brilliant ideas.

Later, I will round out the package by spreading amusing stories about how ignorant you are.

Heed my advice, young Asok. Only an idiot finishes a project before the deadline.

The less time you give people to nitpick. The more time you have to pretend you are overworked.

That depends.

Not really. But now this 2% raise won't seem so bad.

This job is all about managing expectations.

2008-04-07 *

Wally, do yuo have the capital cost estimates I asked for last week?
>>> <<<
No, I always ask you to clarify what you need. You say you'll get back to me but you never do.
>>> <<<
Maybe I could clarify it now.
>>> <<<
That would ruin my system.
>>>
2008-04-06 * 
<<<
I planned to be productive this week.
>>> <<<
I sent you an e-mail with 25 questions I need answered before I can start on my project.

I waited patiently while your non-responsiveness crushed my hopes and dreams.

I don't have time to answer 25 questions!

Well then, it appears we are at a standoff.

Okay, okay! I'll work all weekend answering your stupid questions!!!

That's great, unless you can't find the e-mail I sent.

My project is on hold. Do you need any help on yours? <<<
Sure. Call these customers and tell them we can't deliver on time or with the features they need.

Do you have any tasks that don't feel like getting waterboarded on your birthday?
>>> <<<
And tell them the price went up.

2008-04-02 *

Alice, I want you to interview a job candidate. Let me know what you think.

Why did you leave your last job?

I punched my boss.

He's exactly what we need.

You must be the new coffee machine.

It's aggressive, but I like that in my coffee makers.

I'd like to give you a raise but I used the entire budget on a new coffee maker. <<<
It's a nice one.

There's talk that I paid too much for you.

The security audit accidentally locked all of the developers out of the system. <<<
Well. It is what it is.

How does that help?

You don't know what you don't know.
>>> <<<
Congratulations. You're the first human to fail the turing test.

What does that mean?

Um...

It is what it is?

Why didn't you say that in the first place?

Dilbert says I'm predictable. Am I predictable? <<<
Must...Control sneeze. Must...Not be...predictable.

Mroomph!

Yesterday I drew a picture of what this would look like.

2008-03-28 * 
It's obvious what I need to do next. <<<
But I'll let you tell me so you can maintain the illusion of value.

I saw that coming a mile away.

My cable system wasn't working last night. I didn't have TV or internet.

You're late, as always.

You mean twice. If you include the time you forgot to set your watch back an hour.

And this time when you e-mailed the wrong start time?
>>> <<<
Oh, look how you try and flip it around!

2008-03-25 * 
<<<
Carol, I hired famed archaeologist Dogbert to find the budget report in the clutter of your desk.

This appears to be a copier repairman skull, possibly a ricoh or kyocera.
>>> <<<
I think he used tools.
>>> <<<
Not fast enough.
>>>
2008-03-24 * 
Where can I put this important document so it won't get lost in your desk clutter? <<<
I'll flatten my hair so you can leave it on top of my head.
>>> <<<
Are you happy?
>>> <<<
I didn't know happy was an option.
>>>
2008-03-23 * 
<<<
I need a doctor's note for the two days of work I missed.
>>> <<<
You look healthy to me.
>>> <<<
I got better.
>>> <<<
how do I know you were sick?
>>> <<<
The note just needs to say I was sick.
>>> <<<
so yuo want me to lie?
>>> <<<
It's not a lie. I really was sick. Medical <<<
If your company doesn't trust you, why should I?
>>> <<<
Good point.
>>> <<<
What if I let the people in your waiting room cough on me? Then you can write a note saying I have what they have.
>>> <<<
As long as I didn't recommend it. I think that passes ethical muster.
>>> <<<
You have nine diseases?
>>> <<<
That have names.
>>>
2008-03-22 * 
<<<
I hear your soul was crushed and Catbert slapped off your dried-up head.

Try this juice I've been selling on the side, it's made from actually berries.

Oh, crud. That was the placebo.
>>>
2008-03-21 * 
Catbert: <<<
Evil director of human resources <<<
is there a company sponsored program for regrowing my lost soul?
>>> <<<
No, but I'd be happy to bat your dried-up head until it snaps off.
>>> <<<
I have trouble saying no to free stuff.

2008-03-20 * 
<<<
The world's smartest garbage man says I need to help someone less fortunate to regain my soul.

Don't look at me. I'm happier than a tickled clam.
>>> <<<
I brought you some flowers, dead person.
>>> <<<
I don't need 'em I'm good.
>>>
2008-03-19 * 
<<<
I look different from my online picture because it was taken before my coworkers crushed my soul.
>>> <<<
Would you like to hear an endless series of stories about a coworker you don't know?
>>> <<<
okay.
>>> <<<
Really? Gee, you must have some huge defects of your own.
>>> <<<
I don't deserve to be happy!
>>>
2008-03-18 * 
My pessimistic coworkers have crushed my soul. Now I am nothing but meat with clothes. <<<
You can regain your soul by volunteering to help the less fortunate.
>>> <<<
Who is less fortunate than me?
>>> <<<
Anyone you date.
>>>
2008-03-17 * 
That's my plan. Now I'd like to open the floor to your soul-crushing negativity. <<<
You have written humanity's final chapter!

Darkness stalks us!

I'll never know love!

Anticipating it didn't help.

My management philosophy is 'measure' twice, cut once.'" <<<
That only makes sense in a narrow, and generally archaic, set of conditions.
>>> <<<
In software development, the item being cut, metaphorically speaking, is often plentiful and inexpensive.
>>> <<<
In many cases, the cost of measuring incorrectly is low compared to th time wasted doing two measurements before every action.
>>> <<<
You philosophy is better suited for rock carving than web design.

Do you have any wise sayings that involve churning your own butter, or putting saddles on dinosaurs?

Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

I have direct deposit.

2008-03-15 * 
Dilbert asked me a question in front of the entire group that I already answered last week. <<<
What kind of game is he playing?

Maybe he forgot your answer.

That's crazy talk.

Maybe you have a way of finding out that sort of thing.

2008-03-12 * 
Pronounced Hay-soos. <<<
The new team leader, Jesus, is gaining quite a following.
>>> <<<
He fixed my eyesight and made my hair regrow. I think he wants your job as CEO.
>>> <<<
For forty shares of stock, I could point him out at lunch.
>>> <<<
I'll punch his pilot light out!

2008-03-11 * 
It's pronounced Hay-soos. <<<
My name is Jesus, and I seek twelve people to work on my project.

I am the saver of databases. Join me to upgrade our systems.

First, we're all going to lunch.

I have a bad feeling about this.

2008-03-10 * 
Pronounced Hay-soos <<<
With a name like Jesus, I can't promise I won't mock you.

2008-03-09 * 
<<<
Out online budget approval system isn't working.
>>> <<<
There's a process for making changes to the system, but I don't know it.
>>> <<<
I could take a class to learn the process, but there's also a process for approving classes.
>>> <<<
I could learn the process for approving classes, but I'd still need approval for a budget variance to take the class.
>>> <<<
And I can't get that because the online budget approval system is broken.
>>> <<<
I can't even have this conversation because it will make me charge too much of my engineering time to administrative overhead.
>>> <<<
So I'll go sit in my cubicle and pretend to be thinking about a billable project.
>>> <<<
It looks like I'll be exaggerating my accomplishments again this year.
>>>
2008-03-08 *

Wally, this is your new team leader. He spells his name like Jesus but it's pronounced Hay-Soos.

If you do what Jesus would do, you can enjoy your retirement.

I have a coffee stain that looks just like you.

I get that a lot.

Perfect. Don't chew on the wi-fi signal booster.

do I look like Bill and Melinda Gates?

2008-03-02 * 
What do you think of my idea? <<<
It won't work.
>>> <<<
Why not?
>>> <<<
Do you want the long answer that you won't understand because you possess neither the experience nor the education needed?
>>> <<<
Or the dismissive and insulting answer that has the advantage of being quick?
>>> <<<
Another advantage of the insulting answer is that you can tell people I rejected your idea because I didn't think of it myself.

I guess I'll take the insulting answer.

Fine. Your idea is dummber than snake mittens.

Here's your assignment. Do it! Do it! Do it, you idiot!

What kind of management is that?

That's called tough love.

Tough love only makes sense if I am doing something wrong and refuse to change.

Well, sometimes more is less.

The saying it 'less is more,' not 'more is less.'" <<<
If less equals more, then more must equal less. Duh.

This is the part where you usually refuse to admit you are wrong.

2008-02-03 * 
<<<
How is work Dilbert?
>>> <<<
Well, mom...
>>> <<<
I'm like a fly stuck in a thick tar of despair.
>>> <<<
Incompetence hangs in the air like the cold stench of death.
>>> <<<
I'm drowning, and monkeys dressed as lifeguards are throwing me anvils.
>>> <<<
My job has convinced me that life is a stale joke with no punch line.
>>> <<<
I long for the comfort of the grave.
>>> <<<
Next time just say 'it's fine.'" <<<
I enjoy our talks.
>>> <<<
It's fine.
>>>
2008-02-02 * 
<<<
If I try to give you the raise you deserve, the people above me will just reduce it.
>>> <<<
Maybe you could use some of your political capital to argue my case.
>>> <<<
Maybe not.
>>>
2008-02-01 * 
<<<
do you have any hobbies?
>>> <<<
I like to read obscure articles on the internet and image having friends who are interested in the same things.
>>> <<<
But you do have friends, right?
>>> <<<
Is it too late to change the subject?
>>>
2008-01-31 * 
Dogbert the financial planner <<<
Investing is far too complicated for your tiny brain.
>>> <<<
You are a financial troglodytle!!!
>>> <<<
Do I get some advice now?
>>> <<<
No, our first meeting is just to soften you up.
>>>
2008-01-30 * 
Dogbert the financial planner <<<
With advances in health care, you could live to be 200.
>>> <<<
If you have a good financial plan, only the last 120 years will be spent in squalor.
>>> <<<
I recommend a diversified portfolio. And bacon.
>>>
2008-01-29 * 
I'll tell you my idea if you promise not to reject it before thinking about it. I already rejected it because only putrid ideas come with warnings.
>>> <<<
My time management is getting better.
>>> <<<
I can't pretend to care.
>>>
2008-01-28 * 
<<<
I need a decision, but it involves more than one variable and I know you can't handle that.
>>> <<<
I'll give you an hour to dither before I badger you into making the correct decision.
>>> <<<
I'm going to dither for two hours just to show her who is in charge.
>>>
2008-01-27 * 
<<<
Okay, we have a good plan forward. This meeting is adjourned.
>>> <<<
Oooh!!!
>>> <<<
AaaaH!!!
>>> <<<
What is that?
>>> <<<
AAAH!!!
>>> <<<
She's tasting the sweet nectar of the illusion in progress.
>>> <<<
It's that euphoric feeling you get between the time you make a plan and the time some moron thwarts it.
>>> <<<
AAAH!!!
>>> <<<
It can last anywhere from less than a minute to as much as a minute.
>>> <<<
Ted won't meet with us because someone told him that you told someone else he was an obstacle.
>>> <<<
GRRRRR!!!
>>> <<<
The landing is harsh.
>>>
2008-01-26 * 
<<<
If you hire me, I will do all the jobs that the people born in this country are too fat and lazy to do.
>>> <<<
I don't require a safe working environment, and I thrive on abuse!
>>> <<<
Do you complain much?
>>> <<<
I'll remove my own tongue and give it to you in a pickle jar for boss's day.
>>>
2008-01-25 * 
My new chair can be adjusted to a jillion different positions. <<<
That practically guarantees I'm using it in a suboptimal way. I think it might be disabling me.
>>> <<<
Does that look normal to you?
>>>
2008-01-24 * 
The new software is a disaster. <<<
They why did you recommend it?
>>> <<<
This software is your idea. I recommended against it!
>>> <<<
So who's fault is it?
>>> <<<
The person with the unpersuasive recommendations?
>>>
2008-01-23 * 
Ratbert the software consultant <<<
Don't let your lack of knowledge interfere with my brilliance.
>>> <<<
Don't touch the keyboard, don't offer opinions and don't breathe so loudly that I can hear it.
>>> <<<
There. I've either configured your software or erased something called a bios.
>>>
2008-01-22 * 
Our vendor sent us a consultant to help configure the software. <<<
We can tell how important we are by looking at the consultant they assigned to us.
>>> <<<
The word that comes to mind is doohickey.
>>>
2008-01-21 * 
<<<
this week I functioned as an incubator of innovations for contributions to the value chain.
>>> <<<
To the observer, it looks as if I am doing nothing, but on the inside, I am incubating my brains out.
>>> <<<
It doesn't count unless it hurts.
>>> <<<
It hurts plenty.
>>>
2008-01-20 * 
Catbert: <<<
Evil director of human resources <<<
Your boss says you have a bad attitude.
>>> <<<
That's because my project is a flailing corpse of misery, and my boss donated his brain to a gum museum.
>>> If I had a good attitude in this situation, it would be a sign of a mental imbalance.
>>> <<<
My bad attitude is proof that I am thinking clearly.
>>> <<<
Are you going to compliment me on my clarity or demand I be irrational?
>>> <<<
I'm putting you in charge of the employee morale festival.
>>> <<<
I have a sudden urge to grab you by the tail and beat myself to death.
>>> <<<
That's how I know I won the meeting.
>>>
2008-01-19 * 
<<<
Our CEO didn't understand the powerpoint slides you made for him, so he asked the board of directors for a bonus.
>>> <<<
With any luck, the bonus will incent him to try harder to understand your slides.
>>> <<<
I'm getting better at finding tenuous connections to hope.
>>>
2008-01-18 * 
CEP presents to the board of directors <<<
An underling made these powerpoint slides and I don't understand them.
>>> <<<
But it doesn't matter because all of you are too preoccupied with your day jobs and mistresses to pay attention.
>>> <<<
Who votes to give me a huge bonus just to end this meeting?
>>> "Aye" "Aye" <<<
Aye
>>>
2008-01-17 * 
<<<
Who will present my findings to the board of directors?
>>> <<<
They only listen to the CEO. And he only listens to the senior vice presidents, and they only listen to the...
>>> <<<
Could you show this to the janitor for me?
>>> <<<
Whoa! Whoa! You don't talk to me directly!
>>>
2008-01-16 * 
<<<
I finished my project and I'm ready to present it to the board of directors.
>>> <<<
Interns don't speak to the board of directors, Asok. It would be considered an insult.
>>> <<<
How is that an insult?
>>> <<<
You have the stink of unimportance.
>>>
2008-01-15 * 
<<<
Now that you're out of the loop, your new cubicle will be a giant mushroom.
>>> <<<
It's a pleasant environment except when the mushroom gets its nutrients.
>>> <<<
Nutrients?
>>>
2008-01-14 * 
It's too hard to keep everyone informed about everything. <<<
I've decided to take you out of the loop.
>>> <<<
Really??
>>> <<<
Now I know what fathers mean when they talk about witnessing the birth of their children.
>>> <<<
Lucky!
>>>
2008-01-13 * 
<<<
Dilbert, I need you to help Ted on his project.
>>> <<<
If Ted's project succeeds, who will get the credit?
>>> <<<
Ted will. It's his project.
>>> <<<
What if it fails?
>>> <<<
That would be your fault for not helping him enough.
>>> <<<
If I spend my time helping Ted, my own projects will suffer.
>>> <<<
The only way this makes sense is if my projects are unimportant and so am I.
>>> <<<
If it makes you feel any better, Ted and his projects are unimportant too.
>>>
2008-01-12 * 
Catbert: <<<
Evil director of human resources <<<
I need a goal. What can I do to get a raise?
>>> <<<
Try rewriting the law of supply and demand.
>>> Harsh.
>>> <<<
I have to toss a purr your way.
>>>
2008-01-11 * 
This design will never work in the real world. <<<
That design is already widely used in the real world.
>>> <<<
I can come back later if you need time to concoct additional uninformed criticisms.
>>>
2008-01-10 * 
<<<
Tina, put together a document showing how our budget aligns with out priorities.
>>> <<<
It doesn't.
>>> <<<
Write it so it seems like it does.
>>> <<<
Isn't that lying?
>>> <<<
I call it leadership by words.
>>>
2008-01-09 * 
And those are the company priorities for the coming year. Any questions? <<<
Should I be concerned that none of my projects relate to any of those priorities?
>>> <<<
You're over thinking again.
>>> <<<
Sorry.
>>>
2008-01-08 * 
I'm the official department mole. I'll be reporting your every misstep to your pointy-haired boss. <<<
Won't this have a chilling effect on our creativity and honesty?
>>> <<<
That didn't take long.
>>>
2008-01-07 * 
<<<
What have you learned this week working as my employee mole?
>>> <<<
Some of the people in this building think you're a worthless, self-important gas bag.
>>> What do other people think?
>>> <<<
They don't know you.
>>>
2008-01-06 * 
Topper <<<
I didn't get much sleep last night.
>>> <<<
That's nothing.
>>> <<<
I haven't slept in a month.
>>> <<<
Wouldn't that kill you?
>>> <<<
It did, but that's nothing.
>>> <<<
I spent a week in the afterlife, then I returned to this world as a zombie.
>>> <<<
I taught myself homeopathy and discovered a cure for zombies.
>>> <<<
Now I'm alive again.
>>> <<<
Please be don...Please be done...Please be done...
>>> I took pictures of heaven.
>>> <<<
Gaaa!!!
>>>
2008-01-05 * 
Someone said our pointy-haired boss hired a mole. Moles creep me out. <<<
'mole' is a figure of speech. It's not literally a mole.
>>> <<<
Why do I feel tiny eyes on the back of my neck?
>>>
2008-01-04 * 
<<<
Wally, I need you to attend a meeting on Friday morning.
>>> <<<
But that is bagel Friday. It's the only thing that separates us from the animals.
>>> <<<
You could get a bagel to go.
>>> <<<
It's as if you don't want to understand.
>>>
2008-01-03 * 
<<<
Wally, did you finish the traffic estimates?
>>> <<<
I didn't have time.
>>> <<<
I spent all week shopping on the company's online supply ordering site.
>>> <<<
Hey, you can't blame the guy who just uses the attractive nuisance.
>>>
2008-01-02 * 
What did you do for New Year's Day? <<<
I forgot it was a holiday and came to work for ten hours.
>>> That's sort of loserish.
>>> <<<
Thanks for labeling it.
>>>
2008-01-01 * 
<<<
I had a great day at work. For come reason, no one interrupted me, so I got a lot done.
>>> Today is a holiday.
>>> <<<
All of my victories are tainted.
>>>
2007-12-31 * 
I hate it when people stop working because it's the day before a holiday. <<<
Ha! Ha! Ha!
>>> <<<
It cheapens the lack of work that I cultivate year-round.
>>> <<<
I saw the funniest video clip!
>>> <<<
Tourist!
>>>
2007-12-30 * 
<<<
Alice, your resume is impressive.
>>> <<<
Tell me why you want to be promoted to management.
>>> <<<
Well. Obviously there's the money and prestige.
>>> <<<
I'm also attracted by the prospect of doing much less work.
>>> <<<
The opportunity to abuse subordinates is a big plus.
>>> <<<
And I speak fluent Managerese. Watch this...
>>> <<<
Fuh fuh fuh fuh fuh" <<<
Did you really want that job?
>>> <<<
No, but I love interviewing!
>>>
2007-12-29 * 
What kind of party are we having for New Year's Eve? <<<
Why would I celebrate an arbitrary calendar event?
>>> <<<
Suddenly I don't feel so bad about using your hairbrush as a loofah.
>>>
2007-12-28 * 
<<<
Alice, I got your two weeks' notice.
>>> <<<
Will you stay if I give you a 20% raise?
>>> <<<
Okay.
>>> <<<
Hey dad, do you remember you said I should never be a quitter? You do? Well, it turns out that you're a moron.
>>>
2007-12-27 * 
My new cubicle is too small. It looks fine to me.
>>> <<<
It only seems small because you were so spoiled before.
>>> <<<
I didn't feel spoiled.
>>> <<<
Apparently it sneaks up on you.
>>>
2007-12-26 * 
<<<
And Wally, did you finish your project tasks for today?
>>> <<<
No. I took a calculated risk that other people would not finish their tasks either, making my lateness totally irrelevant.
>>> <<<
Um...
>>> <<<
That is the worst...
>>> <<<
I need another week.
>>>
2007-12-25 * 
<<<
Bruce, you're totally incompetent at your job, so I've moving you to another job.
>>> <<<
I'm hoping your lack of training for your new job will make your incompetence seem normal.
>>> Half of this job is know when to give up.
>>>
2007-12-24 * 
<<<
This concludes the useful part of my presentation.
>>> <<<
Now let's open the floor to suggestions from people who are unqualified to do their own jobs, much less mine.
>>> <<<
Yes, you with the forehead.
>>> <<<
Can you make the software out of recycled paper?
>>>
2007-12-23 * 
<<<
I'm off to the management retreat.
>>> <<<
I won't be reachable because I'll be busy golfing, swimming, drinking, and getting massages.
>>> <<<
And attending meetings?
>>> <<<
I don't see how we'll have any time for that.
>>> <<<
While I'm gone, I have a few tasks for you to do.
>>> <<<
Open all the packages of printer paper and make sure they have the right number of sheets.
>>> <<<
Then crawl into the heating ducts and see if you can find what died in there.
>>> <<<
It's my last boss.
>>> <<<
Spray him with something lemony.
>>>
2007-12-22 * 
<<<
What have you done lately to enhance our strategy into the next adjacency?
>>> <<<
I don't know what that means, so I'm going to say 'everything.'" <<<
He's lucky there's no way to verify that claim.
>>>
2007-12-21 * 
<<<
your staff meeting will take an hour of my life that I will never get back.
>>> <<<
If you let me skip the meeting, I will agree, to die an hour earlier to make up the difference.
>>> <<<
He agreed?
>>> <<<
Yes, and I'm going to use that extra hour of deadness to haunt hum.
>>>
2007-12-20 * 
<<<
Alice, I want you to move to a cubicle closer to the rest of the department.
>>> <<<
Is there a reason that isn't apparent, or is this coming from the reptilian part of your brain?
>>> <<<
How would you know?
>>> <<<
That's a surprisingly good point.
>>>
2007-12-19 * 
<<<
I'm not allowed to discuss the company politics that form a career minefield around your project.
>>> <<<
And I can't tell you the company's new strategic direction, or anything about our upcoming reorg.
>>> <<<
My plan is to criticize you until something good happens.
>>>
2007-12-18 * 
<<<
I hired a dead horse, he doesn't look like much, but if you beat him long enough, he does good work.
>>> <<<
Have you seen him do good work?
>>> <<<
I haven't beaten him long enough.
>>> <<<
Introduce yourself to the others!
>>> Whap!
>>>
2007-12-17 * 
<<<
You have good experience as a dead horse, but can you take a beating?
>>> <<<
So, you think you can ignore my questions, do you?
>>> <<<
Cancel all of my meetings, this could take a few more hours.
>>>
2007-12-16 * 
<<<
I can't give you the highest raise because you didn't exceed expectations.
>>> <<<
If you thought it was possible for my to exceed my expectations, you would have set the goals higher.
>>> <<<
So there are only two possibilities here.
>>> <<<
Either you are incompetent at setting goals...
>>> <<<
Or I attained the maximum possible achievement and I deserve the maximum raise.
>>>"Which is it?
>>> <<<
Can I hear those two choices again?
>>>
2007-12-15 * 
I don't know you. Why are you in this meeting? <<<
I'm creating the illusion of work by conflating the concepts of attendance and productivity.
>>> <<<
You should leave.
>>> <<<
And who should I say hates teamwork?
>>>
2007-12-14 * 
<<<
It was theoretically impossible to work this week.
>>> <<<
Everything I needed to do required me to do something else first, until it all looped back on itself like a Mobius strip.
>>> <<<
Maybe you could make a to-do list.
>>> <<<
As if I had a pencil.
>>>
2007-12-13 * 
Mordac, The preventer of information services <<<
I made some changes to the network that I alone understand.
>>> <<<
I didn't have time to test it, but if there is a problem, I'll be on vacation for three weeks in a Russian submarine below the Arctic circle.
>>> <<<
My screen just went blank.
>>> <<<
Let's chalk that up to coincidence.
>>>
2007-12-12 * 
<<<
Don't you dare take another cup of coffee.
>>> <<<
The more you drink, the more often I have to order coffee. You are destroying my quality of life!
>>> <<<
Gaaa!!!
>>> <<<
If this doesn't make the coffee taste better, I don't know what will.
>>>
2007-12-11 * 
<<<
I was dead for a week, but I managed to reincarnate into my own clone and use my shapeshifting skills to look less like a snickers bar.
>>> <<<
I once waited four hours for a cable tv guy to show up at my house.
>>> <<<
Those stories are no equivalent.
>>> <<<
It's subjective.
>>>
2007-12-10 * 
<<<
Asok died in a work-related accident. His disaster recovery plan was to reincarnate into his own clone.
>>> <<<
You are his clone, but your DNA got mixed up with a snickers bar. You are doomed to walk the earth as half man, half snack.
>>> "Rrrrr" <<<
Phew! It is lucky I studied guided reincarnation and advanced shape-shifting at the Indian Institute of Technology.
>>>
2007-12-09 * 
<<<
I need a cost estimate on your project.
>>> <<<
I have no idea I haven't even gathered the user requirements.
>>> <<<
Don't worry I won't hold you to the estimate.
>>> <<<
Yes you will. You will put it in the plan, forget we had this conversation, and fire me when I go over budget.
>>> <<<
Give me a number or I'll fire you right now.
>>> <<<
Okay, it will cost ten million dollars.
>>> <<<
That's too high.
>>> <<<
If you already know the cost why are you asking me?
>>> <<<
So you'll feel like you had input.
>>> <<<
Is input supposed to feel this bad?
>>>
2007-12-08 * 
<<<
Your prototype killed Asok. That means it is your job to clone him and hope he reincarnates into the clone.
>>> <<<
Carol used his DNA container for a snack jar, so be careful.
>>> <<<
Why do I feel nuts?
>>> <<<
You're part snickers bar.
>>>
2007-12-07 * 
<<<
I am sad to report that Asok the intern died during a test of our moon shuttle prototype.
>>> <<<
Before he left, he put a sample of his DNA in a jar. His plan is to reincarnate into his own clone.
>>> <<<
Where's the jar with Asok's DNA?
>>> <<<
I needed a second candy jar.
>>>
2007-12-06 * 
<<<
Don't worry, Asok. The prototype is perfectly safe.
>>> <<<
I found you a co-pilot. He's a bit grim, but he works for free.
>>> <<<
Hey, I wonder what this button does.
>>>
2007-12-05 * 
<<<
Asok, I need an intern to test-pilot our new moon shuttle prototype.
>>> <<<
Wouldn't it be wiser to send a monkey on the first flight?
>>> <<<
You're thinking of the second flight.
>>>
2007-12-04 * 
<<<
My company wants me to design a private moon shuttle in three months. Doom is inevitable.
>>> <<<
What you need is a scapegoat to blame for the project never getting finished. I'll send one over.
>>> <<<
I was almost done, and then this idiot comes along.
>>>
2007-12-03 * 
<<<
Our next project is building a private shuttle to the moon.
>>> <<<
Now if you make any mistakes, innocent tourists will perish in the vacuum of space.
>>> <<<
We need to work on our rationalizations.
>>> <<<
Is anyone really 'innocent'?
>>>
2007-12-02 * 
<<<
Do you have a minute?
>>> <<<
No.
>>> <<<
This will just take a second.
>>> <<<
No it won't.
>>> <<<
It's real quick.
>>> <<<
You have my word that it will take no longer than five seconds.
>>> <<<
Okay. Go.
>>> <<<
Oh, good. So, I was walking by and I thought maybe I should stop and ask you something because...
>>> <<<
Time's up.
>>> "Jerk" <<<
Liar.
>>>
2007-12-01 * 
<<<
Never tell anyone we don't have enough resources to do a project. It makes us look lame.
>>> <<<
Instead, say we have a fixed capacity that is already dedicated to higher priorities. That makes whoever asked us for help look lame.
>>> <<<
Can I keep telling people I donated all of my blood to hurricane victims?
>>>
2007-11-30 * 
Dogbert's Tech Support <<<
No one else has ever reported that problem.
>>> <<<
That means you are either crazy or a liar.
>>> <<<
It's a little of both, but how did you know?
>>> <<<
I can see through your computer.
>>>
2007-11-29 * 
<<<
What's wrong with your face?
>>> <<<
It's a goatee.
>>> <<<
I hate goatees, so I am using my powers of extreme uncoolness to make them go away.
>>> <<<
That could work.
>>> <<<
GAAA!!!
>>>
2007-11-28 * 
Tina the tech writer <<<
As you requested I increased the speed of my writing.
>>> <<<
My breakthrough was realizing that accuracy and clarity are optional!
>>> <<<
Would you like to micromanage me by reading it all and pointing out the errors?
>>>
2007-11-27 * 
Tina the tech writer <<<
I decided to base your salary on the number of pages you write.
>>> <<<
Fine. I'll give you a high volume of low quality work.
>>> <<<
Sometimes the best you can do is move the hairball to another pocket.
>>>
2007-11-26 * 
We're going to try something called agile programming. <<<
That means no more planning and no more documentation. Just start writing code and complaining.
>>> <<<
I'm glad it has a name.
>>> <<<
That was your training.
>>>
2007-11-25 * 
<<<
Dilbert, I need you to do something, but I don't have time to fully explain it.
>>> <<<
I'll give you just enough information to send you down the wrong path.
>>> <<<
Later, after you do it wrong. I'll treat you like you're some sort of idiot.
>>> <<<
Then I'll put you through the embarrassment of undoing everything you did.
>>> <<<
This might not sound like a good plan to you.
>>> <<<
But it takes the task off of my plate and puts it on yours.
>>> <<<
That's called progress.
>>> <<<
Today I helped make progress.
>>> <<<
Better luck tomorrow.
>>>
2007-11-24 * 
<<<
Your resume is riddled with spelling errors. Why should we hire a moron?
>>> <<<
My poor performance would make you look good in comparison. you'll get a bigger raise if I work here.
>>> <<<
What do you think of him?
>>> <<<
Well, his interview skills are crazy good.
>>>
2007-11-23 * 
<<<
I'd like to take advantage of our new family friendly policy.
>>> <<<
Three of my kids have bronchitis, two have dental appointments, one is in a school play, and one has a rugby game.
>>> <<<
In all likelihood, you will never see me again.
>>> <<<
We didn't think this through.
>>>
2007-11-22 * 
<<<
We've decided to be more family friendly in our policies.
>>> <<<
To compensate for the lost productivity, we'll be openly hostile to single people.
>>> <<<
That doesn't seem fair.
>>> <<<
Shut up and get back to work, eunuch!
>>>
2007-11-21 * 
<<<
This document says a backup server is overkill.
>>> <<<
Um, no, it says the opposite of that. I know because I wrote it this morning.
>>> <<<
No, I think you're misinterpreting it.
>>> <<<
I wrote it!!
>>>
2007-11-20 * 
<<<
Can I order some pens?
>>> <<<
No, it's impossible.
>>> <<<
You need a pen to fill out the pen request form. And if you have a pen, you're not allowed to order one.
>>> <<<
Maybe I could borrow your pen.
>>> <<<
That sounds like some sort of parasitic arrangement.
>>>
2007-11-19 * 
Dogbert Consults <<<
Do you want me to lie to you for $400 per hour or give you the truth for $200?
>>> <<<
I'll take the truth.
>>> <<<
Okay, the problem is that having you try to manage engineers is like having an earthworm try to juggle.
>>> <<<
How's my premium pricing option sound to you now?
>>>
2007-11-18 * 
Career Day <<<
Class, today Dilbert will tell us what a career in engineering is all about.
>>> <<<
My job involves explaining things to idiots.
>>>"Then the idiots make decisions based on misinterpreting what I said.
>>> <<<
Then it is my job to try and fix the massive problems caused by the bad decisions.
>>> <<<
Eventually rumors overwhelm facts, and I give up.
>>> <<<
In the final phase, I assign blame to a unpopular coworker.
>>> <<<
So whatever you do in life don't be unpopular.
>>> <<<
Don't listen to him!
>>> <<<
Said the unpopular teacher.
>>>
2007-11-17 * 
<<<
I am Mordac, the preventer of information services, and I bring you my newest biometric scanner.
>>> <<<
Instead of a password, I put this on your head and squeeze until you scream in a way that only you can scream.
>>> <<<
No, that's not you.
>>> <<<
GAAA! GAAA! GAAA!
>>>
2007-11-16 * 
Mordac, the preventer of information services. <<<
Security is more important than usability.
>>> <<<
In a perfect world, no one would be able to use anything.
>>> To complete the log-in procedure. Stare directly at the sun.

2007-11-15 * 
Then we program the web site using a fast guy in tights and a movie about coffee. <<<
Correct me if I'm wrong.
>>> <<<
We use flash and java script.
>>> <<<
I said 'IF'!!!
>>>
2007-11-14 * 
<<<
I'm trying to develop a good attitude about my job.
>>> <<<
Every morning I tell myself I am invigorated by busywork.
>>> <<<
Asok, I need you to relabel the toner cartridges.
>>> <<<
Woo-hoo!
>>>
2007-11-13 * 
<<<
I don't understand anything you do, so I assume it's all useless.
>>> <<<
Maybe you could go to M.I.T. and get a degree in engineering so you would understand what I do.
>>> <<<
Would that be easier than not giving you a raise?
>>>
2007-11-12 * 
<<<
Asok, I need you to fill in at tech support for a few days.
>>> <<<
You'll be the guy who asks the customer for information, then transfers the call to another person who asks exactly the same questions.
>>> <<<
Wouldn't that make me a barrier to progress?
>>> <<<
Only if the other guy actually helped.
>>>
2007-11-11 * 
<<<
Wall, can I get your comments on my article by tomorrow?
>>> <<<
Sure.
>>> <<<
You say, 'sure,' but we both know it's a lie.
>>> <<<
You just want me to go away.
>>> <<<
You plan to wait until tomorrow and make an excuse.
>>> <<<
Then you'll hope I'll give up.
>>> <<<
Yes, but remember, my comments are always worthless, they would cause you extra work and worsen the result.
>>> <<<
So if I give you nothing. Everyone wins.
>>> <<<
In that case, thank you for ignoring my needs.
>>> <<<
It's the least I could do.
>>>
2007-11-10 * 
<<<
At my old job, we did everything better than we do it here.
>>> <<<
They sound like a great company. It's no wonder they fired you.
>>> <<<
They didn't fire me. I quit to come work here.
>>> <<<
So, your point is that you're a moron?
>>>
2007-11-09 * 
When will I get your project status report? <<<
You're asking for a status report on the status of the status report?
>>> <<<
Right. When can I get that?
>>> <<<
It's starting to look like infinity.
>>>
2007-11-08 * 
<<<
I need a $1,600 handheld bar code scanner to finish my lab tests.
>>> <<<
Okay. Apply for a capital budget variance, prepare an RFP, get three bids, form a team to evaluate the bids, then prepare a purchase order.
>>> <<<
Never mind. I'll just learn how to read bar codes by sight.
>>> <<<
Quitter.
>>>
2007-11-07 * 
Our new strategy has never worked for anyone before. <<<
That will give us the element of surprise.
>>> <<<
Let's get started!
>>> <<<
Can I rebalance my 401(k) first?
>>>
2007-11-06 * 
<<<
You should check with Ted to see if he knows about this sort of thing.
>>> <<<
I'll add that to my list of marginally useful things that other people have suggested I do.
>>> <<<
Apparently, agreeing isn't enough. You also need to say it a certain way.
>>>
2007-11-05 * 
<<<
That price quote includes everything!
>>> <<<
What about taxes, shipping, cables, carts, software, memory upgrades, maintenance and insurance?
>>> <<<
Has anyone ever called you needy?
>>>
2007-11-04 * 
<<<
Where do you think you're going?
>>> <<<
I need to ask our VP of sales a question.
>>> <<<
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
>>> <<<
You can't speak directly with a vice president.
>>> <<<
You need to talk to your boss, who talks to his boss, who talks to someone who is friends with the VP of sales, who then talks to him.
>>> <<<
Wouldn't that virtually guarantee that the wrong question gets asked?
>>> <<<
It's better to have the right person ask the wrong question than the wrong person ask the right questions.
>>> <<<
Do you have a minute?
>>> <<<
Talk to my secretary.
>>>
2007-11-03 * 
<<<
Don't bring me problems, bring me solutions.
>>> <<<
When I bring you solutions, you tell me they won't work and treat me like a moron.
>>> <<<
What's the problem with that?
>>>
2007-11-02 * 
I'd like to buy some snow tires for a refrigerator. <<<
This is a lingerie store. Get lost before I stomp on your tail.
>>> <<<
I think I debunked the theory that the customer is always right.
>>>
2007-11-01 * 
I'm always wrong about everything. What can I do to fix that? <<<
I recommend shopping. The customer is always right.
>>> <<<
Shopping makes me smart?!!
>>> <<<
You aren't shopping yet.
>>>
2007-10-31 * 
Rent a Weasel. <<<
I need three bitter and unsuccessful scientists and a hundred lazy journalists.
>>> <<<
Very good.
>>> <<<
Did you know toddlers thrive on pollution?
>>>
2007-10-30 * 
Dogbert Consults <<<
Every credible scientist on earth says your products harm the environment.
>>> <<<
I recommend paying weasels to write articles casting doubt on the data.
>>> <<<
Then eat the wrong kinds of foods and hope you die before the earth does.
>>> <<<
You're making me hungry!
>>>
2007-10-29 * 
<<<
What didn't you use any of my suggestions?
>>> <<<
My thoery is that your brain is the size of a marble, and twice as smooth.
>>> <<<
The root cause probably involves slow learners mating for many generations.
>>>
2007-10-28 * 
My brain is empty. <<<
It feels great!
>>> <<<
Stress is just another word for knowledge.
>>> <<<
Wait a minute. How do I know that?
>>> <<<
GAAA!!! Something got past the filters!
>>> <<<
Must...Do...Mantra...
>>> <<<
Lindsay Lohan...Britney Spears...Paris Hilton...Ommmmm.
>>> <<<
Are you all good now?
>>> <<<
Have we met?
>>>
2007-10-27 * 
<<<
Do you mind if I give you some advice?
>>> <<<
Not at all.
>>> <<<
Do you mind if I roll my eyes, sigh deeply, and dismiss your advice as if it came from the village idiot?
>>> <<<
I might mind.
>>> <<<
Well then, let me give you some advice...
>>>
2007-10-26 * 
<<<
Why does it seem as if most of the decisions in my workplace are made by drunken lemurs?
>>> <<<
Decisions are made by people who have time, not people who have talent.
>>> <<<
Why are talented people so busy?
>>> <<<
They're fixing the problems made by people who have time.
>>>
2007-10-25 * 
Catbert: <<<
Evil director of human resources <<<
From now on, all sick days must be scheduled in advance.
>>> <<<
That's ridiculous. how are we supposed to know when we're going to be sick?
>>> <<<
Tomorrow.
>>> <<<
I hired a guy who never washes his hands to help you with scheduling.
>>>
2007-10-24 * 
I'm addicted to the internet. <<<
I no longer care for direct human interaction. It's too shallow and predictable.
>>> <<<
Maybe you shoudl try some outdoor activities.
>>> <<<
I saw that coming.
>>>
2007-10-23 * 
I can't do my work because the internet is too fascinating. <<<
The physical world no longer hold my interest. I find job only on the internet.
>>> <<<
Can I take a hit on your iphone before I go back to my cubicle?
>>> <<<
No.
>>>
2007-10-22 * 
Dogbert the security consultant <<<
If you see someone without an ID badge...
>>> <<<
...Strip search him, confiscate his wallet, and lock him in the janitor's closet until he starves!
>>> <<<
That seems a bit extreme.
>>> <<<
You're about one minute away from living on mop water.
>>>
2007-10-21 * 
My accomplishment this week was helping Alice finish her project in a timely manner.
>>> <<<
You didn't do anything to help me.
>>> <<<
Sure I did.
>>> <<<
Remember when I came to your cubicle to ask for some data I need for my project?
>>> <<<
You said you were too busy, and shooed me away.
>>> <<<
If I had insisted on doing my job, you would have had less time to do yours.
>>> <<<
It's called teamwork.
>>> <<<
Are we still big on that?
>>> <<<
Must control...First...Of...Death.
>>>
2007-10-20 * 
Dogbert the security consultant <<<
Be on the lookout for any suspicious behavior.
>>> <<<
If you see a guy do something that you wouldn't do, beat him to death with a trash can.
>>> <<<
Can we use recycle bins?
>>> <<<
I wouldn't have asked that question.
>>>
2007-10-19 * 
This week I increased my productivity by improving my morale. <<<
I watched funny youtube videos from morning until dusk.
>>> <<<
That's all you did?
>>> <<<
Don't worry. I'm almost halfway done.
>>>
2007-10-18 * 
Make these changes and run it by me again. <<<
history suggests I have entered an infinite loop of making changes with no hope of finishing.
>>> <<<
My life is a furious ball of nothing.
>>> <<<
And I'm not wild about the font.
>>>
2007-10-17 * 
<<<
Why does Dilbert get two computer monitors while I only get one?
>>> <<<
Well, according to researchers, it's because men tend to negotiate and women don't.
>>> <<<
So, what happens now?
>>> <<<
If I had to guess, I'd say more complaining.
>>>
2007-10-16 * 
<<<
My pay is below market. Can I have a 20% raise?
>>> <<<
No, but I'll let you use two flat screen monitors in your cubicle so it feels like you're an evil genius in a secret lair.
>>> <<<
Bu-Wa-HAHA!
>>> <<<
Who got a second monitor?
>>>
2007-10-15 * 
Alice is spreading false rumors about me. She's trying to make me quit. <<<
At this company we don't get all anal about the difference between false rumors and actual facts.
>>> <<<
That's not fair!
>>> <<<
Said the alleged poacher of endangered species.
>>>
2007-10-14 * 
I found a clever way to write my application code in one hour! <<<
Normally this sort of thing would take weeks.
>>> <<<
I assume my high level of efficiency will be recognized and rewarded.
>>> <<<
Let me know how that works out for you.
>>> <<<
You did all of that in one hour?
>>> <<<
Yes. I did.
>>> <<<
From now on. I expect you to finish all of your projects in one hours.
>>> <<<
Otherwise I'll assume you're ripping off the company.
>>> <<<
You could have warned me.
>>> <<<
That's not how experience works.
>>>
2007-10-13 * 
<<<
Hello, Keith. You're the next coworker I have targeted for elimination.
>>> <<<
I'll be using a rumor campaign to convince everyone you are dishonest and incompetent.
>>> <<<
Why???
>>> <<<
Do I need a reason?
>>> <<<
We think she wasn't hugged enough.
>>>
2007-10-12 * 
your unqualified crony is causing a rebellion among the staff. <<<
There's not need to blow this all out of proportion.
>>> <<<
But I promise to monitor the situation.
>>>
2007-10-11 * 
I hired an unqualified crony to run our quality control group. <<<
I value loyalty over competence. That's the sign of a great leader.
>>> <<<
Do you see any problem with that?
>>> <<<
It makes you look extra disloyal?
>>>
2007-10-10 * 
The new guy is a huge weasel. Don't believe anything he says. <<<
You say that about all the new hires so they won't seem credible when they complain about you.
>>> <<<
I'll stop doing it when it stops working.
>>>
2007-10-09 * 
You treat every conversation like it's a contest where you have to be the one who is right! <<<
It only seems that way because everything you say is wrong.
>>> <<<
See? There it is!
>>> <<<
I'm pretty sure that was you again.
>>>
2007-10-08 * 
Explain why you charge less of your time to projects than all the other engineers. <<<
I'm trying something new. It's called honesty.
>>> <<<
Stop doing that.
>>> <<<
Okay brilliant suggestion.
>>>
2007-10-07 * 
Tomorrow is the mandatory meeting on employee health and well-being. <<<
The meeting starts at 6 A.M. So it will interfere with your sleep and not your work.
>>> <<<
Doesn't that send a message that work is more important than health?
>>> <<<
I hope so. That's the theme of the meeting.
>>> <<<
Healthy employees are unproductive.
>>> <<<
They're always exercising or eating fruit when they should be working.
>>> <<<
We prefer employees who work hard and die before their pensions start paying out.
>>> <<<
Suddenly I feel sick.
>>> <<<
Right on schedule!
>>>
2007-10-06 * 
<<<
Did you look at my powerpoint presentation?
>>> <<<
Yes, it's a confused jumble of useless information with a wino's spittle of unsupported conclusions.
>>> <<<
Wino's spittle?
>>> <<<
You heard me.
>>>
2007-10-05 * 
I quadrupled my workload to finish projects before I go on vacation. <<<
I'm going home early to watch Battlestar Galactica on my DVR.
>>> <<<
I might eat a nice sandwich!
>>> <<<
Must...Not...Envy...The vacationless.
>>>
2007-10-04 * 
<<<
Remember to use all of your vacation time before year end.
>>> <<<
I'm off next week.
>>> <<<
What! I curse you for taking time off when we have so much work to do! DIE, DIE, DIE!!!
>>> <<<
Anyway, the point is that vacations help relieve your stress.
>>>
2007-10-03 * 
The Sadist vs. Wally <<<
You are worthless and overpaid!
>>> <<<
Thank you.
>>> <<<
He's immune to my sadism.
>>> <<<
So, what's it like being underpaid?
>>>
2007-10-02 * 
I hired a sadist. <<<
Why?
>>> <<<
I'llbe using her to thin the herd.
>>> <<<
Herd?
>>> <<<
That one looks slow.
>>> <<<
They all look like that.
>>>
2007-10-01 * 
<<<
Why did it take six months to complete this simple task?
>>> <<<
Because of your continuous changes, your unclear communication, and your short work days.
>>> <<<
I'm looking for something more along the lines of you being lazy.
>>>
2007-09-30 * 
<<<
What are you doing?
>>> <<<
Carpet fishing.
>>> <<<
It's a sport I invented.
>>> <<<
I divided the carpet in my cubicle into a numbered grid.
>>> <<<
Then I wrote a computer program that randomly picks a carpet location and a type of fish about once an hour.
>>> <<<
If it picks the carpet location where I happen to be dangling this string, it means I hooked a fish.
>>> <<<
Yesterday I caught a marlin.
>>> <<<
Did you come here for some reason other than to spoil the salmon run?
>>>
2007-09-29 * 
<<<
Wally, your choice of words leads us to think you are only pretending to be loyal to the company.
>>> <<<
Sorry. I'll try to appear more loyal in the future.
>>> <<<
You did it again.
>>> <<<
Don't be silly. I couldn't be more loyal.
>>>
2007-09-28 * 
<<<
Wally, it's ten o'clock. You're supposed to start at eight.
>>> <<<
That's because I plan to work for two unverifiable hours after you leave tonight.
>>> <<<
My alleged loyalty to this company is second to none.
>>>
2007-09-27 * 
It's time for some generic management. <<<
Did you talk to what's his name about the thing?
>>> <<<
Um...Yes.
>>> <<<
There should be some sort of award for avoiding minutiae.
>>>
2007-09-26 * 
Today I complete my high priority tasks and launched them into the miasma. <<<
There they will rot from neglect while I draw closer to the abyss of eternal nothingness.
>>> <<<
I have an idea. Let's never talk about you.
>>>
2007-09-25 * 
<<<
donate to my campaign, and I'll let you drill for oil in my opponent's lawn.
>>> <<<
And I'll appoint you to run the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms.
>>> <<<
Is that as fun as it sounds?
>>> <<<
Not for your neighbors.
>>>
2007-09-24 * 
Dogbert for president <<<
As president, I will not make decisions based on polls.
>>> <<<
In fact, I won't give you a single thing that you want. That's called leadership.
>>> <<<
I'll never understand why that works.
>>> <<<
yay!
>>> clap! clap! clap! clap! clap!
>>>
2007-09-23 * 
I changed the product design. <<<
It's worse than the old design.
>>> <<<
You asked me to come up with a new design.
>>> <<<
I meant a new design that's better than the old design.
>>> <<<
Great. You could have told me that before I did all this work.
>>> <<<
How do you think this makes me feel?
>>> <<<
No one would blame me for hating you.
>>> <<<
I'm the only sane person in this company.
>>>
2007-09-22 * 
<<<
Carol, did you update the org chart yet?
>>> <<<
No. I kept waiting for it to become more important than my personal problems. But it just never happened.
>>> <<<
how about right now?
>>> <<<
Ouch! I think that's my appendix!
>>>
2007-09-21 * 
<<<
Wally, did you get those cost estimates I asked for last week?
>>> <<<
No, I need constant supervision.
>>> <<<
Can you do it now?
>>> <<<
Do you have time to watch?
>>>
2007-09-20 * 
<<<
I saw a fascinating documentary about bugs.
>>> <<<
In other words, you like bugs more than you like me.
>>> <<<
In other words, you like bugs more than you like me.
>>> <<<
Yes, but I didn't realize it until just now.
>>>
2007-09-19 * 
<<<
Alice, Did you hear I'm getting a cubicle by the window?
>>> <<<
Although I wouldn't want that cubicle because of the glare, the fact that you want it makes me hate you for getting it.
>>> <<<
We're like a family here.
>>> <<<
I hope it collapses on your head!
>>>
2007-09-18 * 
Dogbert, VP of marketing <<<
As head of public relations, it will be my job to explain your marketing claims.
>>> <<<
So?
>>> <<<
You claim our product can turn tap water into unleaded gasoline and reanimate the dead.
>>> <<<
Are you asking my to do a lousy job of marketing just so your job is easier?
>>> <<<
Um...
>>>
2007-09-17 * 
Dogbert, the VP of marketing <<<
Describe your product in technical terms and I'll turn it into marketing language.
>>> <<<
Well, it tends to overheat.
>>> <<<
'hottest product on the market!'" <<<
All the parts are known carcinogens.
>>> <<<
Makes you appreciate life!
>>>
2007-09-16 * 
<<<
You didn't make any of the contract changes we agreed on last month.
>>> <<<
That's how I negotiate.
>>> <<<
I'm not authorized to make any changes to the contract.
>>> <<<
And the executives who have that power will think I'm not doing my job if I ask them to do it.
>>> <<<
So I agree to everything you ask, then I don't put any of it in the contract.
>>> <<<
Over the course of several months I hope to wear you down and make you sign the contract as is.
>>> <<<
Can you at least change section three the way I asked? <<<
Sure. No problem.
>>> <<<
I'll see you in a month.
>>>
2007-09-15 * 
Dogbert, the VP of marketing <<<
It's my job to spraypaint the roadkill.
>>> <<<
I'll use a process the experts call 'dishonesty'.
>>> <<<
My motto is 'if it isn't immoral, it probably won't work'.
>>>
2007-09-14 * 
Our new VP of marketing promises to improve our revenues by ten billion percent! <<<
That is a ridiculous lie that only a gullible moron would believe.
>>> <<<
Oh yeah? How do you explain the fact that HE believed it?
>>> <<<
Touche
>>>
2007-09-13 * 
<<<
We can't compete on price.
>>> <<<
We also can't compete on quality features or service.
>>> <<<
That leaves fraud, which I'd like you call marketing.
>>>
2007-09-12 * 
People are complaining about how you use your security card. <<<
We'd appreciate it if you didn't keep it in your front pocket and thrust it at the door sensor.
>>> <<<
I didn't know the security card was why the door opened.
>>>
2007-09-11 * 
<<<
Alice, see me at the end of business today.
>>> <<<
Ohmygod, ohymygod, what corpse floated up from the ocean floor? I can't wait  seven hours. Gah!
>>> Seven hours later <<<
What?! What?! What?!
>>> <<<
Can you come back tomorrow?
>>>
2007-09-10 * 
I'll need more than tall pants and traditional looking hair to get elected to president. <<<
I'm hoping to form an unholy alliance with the military industrial complex.
>>> <<<
You're willing to attack allies?
>>> <<<
It's the highest R.O.I.
>>>
2007-09-09 * 
<<<
I didn't have time to finish my tasks for this meeting.
>>> <<<
No problem.
>>> <<<
If you get cornered, read this powerful anti-meeting spell.
>>> <<<
Asok, did you finish the traffic estimates?
>>> <<<
Um...I was wondering if our new service is Web 2.0 or Web 1.0.
>>> <<<
Obviously it's a Web 2.0 application because of the tag-based folksonomies.
>>> <<<
No it isn't. All of our technology existed before the Internet bubble.
>>> <<<
'When' doesn't matter. It only matters that we use the Web as a platform!
>>> <<<
Everything is a platform!
>>> <<<
Freaky.
>>>
2007-09-08 * 
<<<
Everyone says your new circuit design is worse than the old one.
>>> <<<
By 'everyone', do you mean you heard it from one person who doesn't like me, and isn't familiar with either design?
>>> <<<
I also spoke to the people who heard it from that one person.
>>>
2007-09-07 * 
<<<
Although I've been fired for gross incompetence, I'm professional enough to train you before I leave.
>>> <<<
Don't bother. I already coded a Java app to do everything you do.
>>> <<<
Everything?
>>> <<<
Except for the incompetent parts.
>>>
2007-09-06 * 
<<<
Carl, I have to fire you.
>>> <<<
You're totally incompetent at everything you do.
>>> <<<
Before you go, I'd like you to teach Dilbert how to do your job.
>>>
2007-09-05 * 
Which way is the microwave? <<<
Thanks.
>>> <<<
It's getting harder to be open-minded.
>>>
2007-09-04 * 
<<<
I finished all of my work, and now I'm available for another high profile assignment.
>>> <<<
Create a document and route it around for approval.
>>> <<<
On what topic?
>>> <<<
How to keep an intern busy.
>>>
2007-09-03 * 
<<<
I hired all of you because the project will take 300 man days to complete.
>>> <<<
There are 300 of you, so I want you to finish by five o'clock and clean out your desks. You're all fired.
>>> <<<
If it takes more than one meeting to manage a project, I lose interest.
>>>
2007-09-02 * 
<<<
Our CEO's son is joining the department as an intern.
>>> <<<
I want you to be his mentor.
>>> <<<
And by mentor, I mean don't let the little spy learn anything about us.
>>> <<<
If he finds out what we do, he'll tell his dad we're doing it wrong.
>>> <<<
Here's a list of compliments you can give him.
>>> <<<
Tell him his assignment is to go someplace and study cool motorcycles.
>>> <<<
If he asks more than three questions, kill him.
>>> <<<
Where's my desk?
>>> <<<
That's one.
>>>
2007-09-01 * 
<<<
I made a typo in my annual budget request, but don't worry.
>>> <<<
There are only two things you can't buy for the test lab this year.
>>> <<<
Hardware and software.
>>>
2007-08-31 * 
<<<
Ted, I have to let you go, but there's a good reason.
>>> <<<
There's no money to pay your salary because I made a typo in my budget request.
>>> <<<
Until then, I was totally planning to reward your hard work.
>>>
2007-08-30 * 
<<<
According to our employee brain monitor, you have not been thinking about work.
>>> <<<
All of your brain activity is in the zones that control love of coffee, digestive functions and...uh-oh.
>>> <<<
I'M BLIND!!!
>>> <<<
Oh, that one.
>>>
2007-08-29 * 
Catbert: <<<
evil director of human resources <<<
Some of you have been thinking about happy things when you should be working.
>>> <<<
These sensors will alert management any time the pleasure areas of your brain have more blood flow.
>>> <<<
I was happier not knowing.
>>> ding ding ding ding ding ding ding
2007-08-28 * 
We financed our expansion by selling the goodwill on our balance sheet to a wealthy investor. <<<
I made a list of the customers that I want your products to injure.
>>> <<<
Your lawyer did a bad job on the contract.
>>> <<<
His name is on your list.
>>>
2007-08-27 * 
<<<
Now that I have purchased your company's goodwill, I plan to make some changes.
>>> <<<
I redesigned your headquarters building.
>>> <<<
What's this part that looks like a horse's rump?
>>> <<<
That's the entrance to the executive suite.
>>>
2007-08-26 * 
<<<
I can't give you a raise because you ask me too many questions.
>>> <<<
That's a sign that you can't do your job.
>>> <<<
I anticipated your misperception and prepared for it.
>>> <<<
I saved all of my e-mails and matched them to your policies and procedures.
>>> <<<
For example, this is your e-mail saying we need your permission to buy software.
>>> <<<
And here's my e-mail asking if I can buy some software.
>>> <<<
Should I run through the other seven hundred documented examples?
>>> <<<
There you go asking another question.
>>>
2007-08-25 * 
We have too much goodwill on the balance sheet. I decided to sell some of it. <<<
A mysterious buyer offered a million dollars for the right to decrease our goodwill.
>>> <<<
You might have a bit less job satisfaction next week.
>>>
2007-08-24 * 
<<<
As you requested, I sorted the future product features into three priorities.
>>> <<<
Let me know which group I should stop working on.
>>> Essential Critical Must-Have <<<
This is the part where you pretend to add value.
>>>
2007-08-23 * 
<<<
When I was a boy, I dreamed of one day working in a fabric-covered box.
>>> <<<
I'm living proof that dreams can come true.
>>> <<<
Women don't like winners either.

Stockholder meeting <<<
Do we have any questions from gadflies?
>>> <<<
You earned 72 million dollars while our stock price dropped nine percent. How can you sleep at night?
>>> zzzzz
2007-08-21 * 
<<<
Then I found out there are two kinds of face-lifts.
>>> <<<
I accidentally checked the box for the kind that lets you see over the top of your cubicle.
>>> <<<
So I try to drink more, but that isn't working out either.
>>>
2007-08-20 * 
<<<
Alice, you have the highest salary in the department. But don't tell anyone what it is.
>>> <<<
Dilbert, you have the highest salary in the department. But don't tell anyone what it is.
>>> <<<
I can't believe I never thought of that before.
>>> <<<
Yeah, especially since you're the highest paid manager.
>>>
2007-08-19 * 
<<<
I called this meeting to discuss the changes to the pension plan.
>>> <<<
We already saw the company-wide e-mail about the changes.
>>> <<<
And we're all engineers, so we understand the details better than you do.
>>> <<<
I'll bet you intend to waste our time by reading the e-mail to us.
>>> <<<
You can't stop yourself. it's some sort of compulsion.
>>> <<<
If you read that e-mail, it's proof that something is wrong with your brain.
>>> <<<
Can't...resist...reading...e-mail.
>>> <<<
Best meeting ever.
>>> <<<
GAAA!!!
>>>
2007-08-18 * 
Coffee swilling beaver <<<
If a tree falls in the forest, and no one hears it...
>>> <<<
I'd still chew the bejeezus out of it because I have no impulse control.
>>> <<<
That reminds me: the pencil I borrowed from you isn't coming back.
>>>
2007-08-17 * 
<<<
Carol, I give you far too much work. There's only one solution.
>>> <<<
I hired a coffee swilling beaver to show you how to work faster.
>>> <<<
When I watch you, it's as if time stands still.
>>>
2007-08-16 * 
I didn't understand anything you just said. Go away. <<<
Our CEO doesn't like your idea. He didn't say why.
>>> <<<
Do you ever feel like you're wallpapering fog?
>>> <<<
I don't get that invested.
>>>
2007-08-15 * 
<<<
Carol, set up a meeting with the technology review board to decide how we'll decide on new technologies.
>>> <<<
Do you also need a meeting to decide how you will put together a meeting to decide how to decide things?
>>> <<<
Maybe I should get some people together to help you answer that question.
>>> <<<
Maybe.
>>>
2007-08-14 * 
<<<
Ratbert, I want you to be my vice presidential running mate.
>>> <<<
Your job is to be so unpopular that no one will want to assassinate me.
>>> <<<
I can do that!
>>> <<<
Seriously. Stop campaigning on my shoe.
>>> grrr!!!
>>>
2007-08-13 * 
<<<
If you are elected president, what will you do in the first hundred days?
>>> <<<
I figure it will take me at least that long to carve my name in all the furniture.
>>> <<<
Then it would be time to wipe that smug smile off of Switzerland's face.
>>>
2007-08-12 * 
<<<
Prepare a proposal for this customer.
>>> <<<
Why me?
>>> <<<
You were walking by. I had it in my head.
>>> <<<
We can't win this business. We don't have the right products or expertise.
>>> <<<
Just say we do. We'll figure it out later.
>>> <<<
They know we don't. And we'd still be the most expensive bidder.
>>> <<<
Bid low. We'll make it up with change orders and unexpected essential upgrades.
>>> <<<
In other words, I've been randomly assigned to create lies for a proposal we can't win for a service we can't perform.
>>> <<<
You make competing sound bad.
>>>
2007-08-11 * 
Dogbert for President <<<
Vote for me or the terrorists will use your skulls for salad bowls.
>>> <<<
I promise to take money from the people who don't vote for me and give it to the people who do.
>>> <<<
Pollution has vitamins!
>>> <<<
I like how he makes me feel.
>>>
2007-08-10 * 
I'm wearing my tall pants and my old-fashioned hairpiece because I'm running for president. <<<
I put a glove on my tail so I can shake 50% more hands.
>>> <<<
My policy is to give all the money in the treasury to Iowans. But I might flip-flop after the first primary.
>>>
2007-08-09 * 
<<<
Cancel all of my meetings. I'm going to manage by making spreadsheets and sending e-mails.
>>> <<<
With any luck, I'll never again need to speak with unimportant subordinates such as yourself.
>>> <<<
C23 is in a bad mood today.
>>> <<<
@#$%^!
>>>
2007-08-08 * 
<<<
Asok, according to my spreadsheet, you have been doing a terrible job.
>>> <<<
Perhaps your spreadsheet is poorly conceived and does not capture the complexity of the real world.
>>> <<<
And let's not forget the near certainty that your formulae are pointing to the wrong cells.
>>> <<<
Numbers don't lie.
>>>
2007-08-07 * 
I've decided to manage by spreadsheet. <<<
I'll track things until all of our problems fix themselves.
>>> <<<
Your optimism is cute.
>>> <<<
Thanks. You're pretty fuzzy yourself.
>>>
2007-08-06 * 
Did you get the note I left on your monitor? <<<
Yes.
>>> <<<
Did you get my voicemail?
>>> <<<
Yes.
>>> <<<
Did you get my e-mail?
>>> <<<
Yes.
>>> <<<
Should I tell you what the note and voicemail and e-mail said?
>>> <<<
There's something wrong with you.
>>>
2007-08-05 * 
When do you expect to come out with a new model? <<<
In about two months.
>>> <<<
I'll wait and buy the new model.
>>> <<<
Did I say two months? I meant never.
>>> <<<
Never? That must mean your company is going out of business and won't support this product.
>>> <<<
What's a length of time between two months and never that would cause you to buy now?
>>> <<<
One year.
>>> <<<
Our new model comes out in a year.
>>> <<<
I'll wait until then.
>>> <<<
You're the worst customer ever.
>>>
2007-08-04 * 
I narrowed down the options to an alternative that costs too much and another that won't work. <<<
I didn't do any research. It's more of an experience sort of thing.
>>> <<<
Next week I plan to think about the option of using technology that isn't yet available.
>>>
2007-08-03 * 
<<<
From now on, I want you to use open source software for everything we do. It's free.
>>> <<<
I'll be right back.
>>> <<<
It's an emergency. I think he's been reading.
>>> <<<
We know you have a trade publication in here. Hand it over and no one has to get hurt.
>>>
2007-08-02 * 
<<<
Are you wearing noise cancellation headphones?
>>> <<<
What?
>>> <<<
I SAID, ARE YOU WEARING NOISE CANCELLATION HEADPHONES?!
>>> <<<
What?
>>> <<<
This won't end well.
>>> <<<
I SAID...
>>>
2007-08-01 * 
<<<
Wally, I bought Dogbert's Management Software to yell at you so I don't have to.
>>> <<<
I recommend Track 3, titled 'You're my least valuable asset'.
>>> <<<
Who wants to buy Dogbert's noise cancellation headphones for bad employees?
>>> <<<
I need you less than my mousepad.
>>>
2007-07-31 * 
There are two kinds of management problems. <<<
There's the kind you can solve by yelling and the kind you can solve by buying some sort of software.
>>> <<<
That's why I created 'Some sort of software that yells'.
>>> <<<
Ooo!!!
>>>
2007-07-30 * 
<<<
I can't develop an automated testing system by the arbitrary deadline you set.
>>> <<<
Try working smarter, not harder, with a sense of urgency, and a bias for action.
>>> <<<
Or maybe you could do something differently.
>>> <<<
I'm not the one who can't get his work done.
>>>
2007-07-29 * 
<<<
What would your system cost?
>>> <<<
We can deliver in two weeks.
>>> <<<
But what would it cost?
>>> <<<
A lot of vendors deliver in four weeks, but we can do it in two.
>>> <<<
I'm asking about price, not delivery schedules.
>>> <<<
Do you want it shipped by ground or air? Air is even faster.
>>> <<<
What does it cost?
>>> <<<
Ground costs less than air.
>>> <<<
GAAA!!! What does the SYSTEM cost?!!
>>> <<<
For ground?
>>>
2007-07-28 * 
<<<
You eliminated the budget for automated test software. How are we going to test our new code?
>>> <<<
Go write some automated test software, you big baby. I already pay you, so it's free.
>>> <<<
Today I learned I can end any conversation by calling the other person a big baby.
>>> <<<
Waa-waa! Do you want your bottle?
>>>
2007-07-27 * 
<<<
I hired the Dogbert Moving Company to handle your relocation.
>>> <<<
It saves us money because they only send one huge guy.
>>> <<<
After you load your couch on the truck, make me another sandwich, or, again, I'll kill you.
>>>
2007-07-26 * 
All of your e-mails this week were marked as highest priority. <<<
So I spent the entire week working on the first one.
>>> <<<
Next week I plan to continue not feeding the squirrels by the east entrance.
>>>
2007-07-25 * 
<<<
I can't stop punching people who deserve to be punched.
>>> <<<
For example, your high rates and ridiculous combover make me want to punch your face in.
>>> <<<
But you won't, right?
>>> <<<
Let's see what happens when I regain the element of surprise.
>>>
2007-07-24 * 
I asked Wally to stop eating noisy snacks in his cubicle but he refuses. <<<
That's because he likes salt more than he likes you. We all feel the same way.
>>> <<<
What?
>>> <<<
You're somewhere between oatmeal and kelp.
>>>
2007-07-23 * 
Your snacks are too loud. crunch crunch crunch <<<
Only inconsiderate jerks eat crunchy food in cubicles.
>>> crunch crunch crunch <<<
Maybe you should try to make me love you more than I love salt.
>>>
2007-07-22 * 
Our pointy-haired boss is insisting we use old technology because he thinks it will be easier to get it funded. <<<
You should raise that issue at the meeting.
>>> <<<
We'll back you up.
>>> <<<
Absolutely.
>>> <<<
Are there any issues?
>>> <<<
You're making us use old technology just to make your job easier.
>>> <<<
Does anyone else think that?
>>> <<<
No.
>>> <<<
No.
>>> <<<
No.
>>> <<<
The old technology works fine.
>>> <<<
New technology is too buggy.
>>> <<<
What was that?!!
>>> <<<
It's just something we do.
>>>
2007-07-21 * 
<<<
I got promoted to lead engineer.
>>> <<<
Me too.
>>> <<<
Wow. Buzz kill.
>>> <<<
Right back at you.
>>> <<<
If you think about it, all motivation is temporary.
>>>
2007-07-20 * 
I'm promoting you from senior engineer to lead engineer. <<<
The pay is the same but people will disrespect you less.
>>> <<<
Including you?
>>> <<<
It's not magic.
>>>
2007-07-19 * 
Employee Orientation <<<
This job will leave you with no time for exercise.
>>> <<<
You will work long hours and consume trans fats until you are shaped like this.
>>> <<<
On a positive note, our payroll deduction service allows you to save money for dirt to turn your cubicle into a burial site.
>>>
2007-07-18 * 
I'd like your input on the idea of hiring a coordinator for our projects. <<<
Terrible idea.
>>> <<<
Waste of money.
>>> <<<
Wouldn't help.
>>> <<<
He starts Monday.
>>>
2007-07-17 * 
My Elbonian division won't do any work unless someone is watching them every minute. <<<
Tell them you have hidden cameras.
>>> <<<
Then randomly fire one Elbonian per week.
>>> <<<
Hee-hee! Evil makes my buttocks tingle.
>>>
2007-07-16 * 
I'll be managing the Elbonian branch office but I'll be based in my own country. <<<
I'll never see you in person but I want you all to work long hours and wear Dockers.
>>> <<<
What is he doing?
>>> <<<
Sometimes we use mud to muffle laughter.
>>>
2007-07-15 * 
<<<
No offense, but you're totally unqualified for this position.
>>> <<<
That's okay. I already have a job.
>>> <<<
I just need a job offer at a higher salary so I can use it to negotiate for a raise.
>>> <<<
My boss is an irrational dipwad who is easily manipulated by bogus comparisons and the illusion of scarcity.
>>> <<<
Your offer will make him think my value is much higher than it actually is.
>>> <<<
Great. Now that I know I can't have you, I desperately want to hire you.
>>> <<<
My mind is already forming rationalizations for your total lack of qualifications!
>>> <<<
How do you turn this off?!!
>>> <<<
I'll tell you after you write the offer.
>>>
2007-07-14 * 
Catbert, evil director of human resources <<<
Our new policy is no drinking coffee during work.
>>> <<<
That should remove all doubt that our policies are designed for any reason other than evil.
>>> <<<
Your honesty is refreshing.
>>> <<<
Stop ruining the moment!!!
>>>
2007-07-13 * 
<<<
You're not allowed to have internal phone lists on your wall.
>>> <<<
There are excellent reasons for this policy, and I hope to someday know what they are.
>>> <<<
They're getting suspicious about the random policy generator.
>>> spoit!
>>>
2007-07-12 * 
<<<
Carol, set up a dinner for all key employees.
>>> <<<
Which ones are key?
>>> <<<
That would be everyone except um...you.
>>> <<<
I curse your dinner!
>>> <<<
I'll bring you some mints...if they have extras.
>>>
2007-07-11 * 
Does anyone here have any knowledge or any authority to make decisions? <<<
I'm only here to listen and misinterpret.
>>> <<<
Let's try to build on that.
>>>
2007-07-10 * 
<<<
Ted, I'm going to eliminate your function and outsource it to the Dogbert Outsourcing Company.
>>> <<<
I need a job.
>>> <<<
You're hired.
>>> <<<
I'M BA-A-ACK!
>>>
2007-07-09 * 
How was the all hands meeting? <<<
Creepy.
>>>
2007-07-08 * 
<<<
You should hire me as your management consultant.
>>> <<<
We're a management consulting firm. We don't need a management consultant to consult us.
>>> <<<
Are you saying that management consulting is worthless?
>>> <<<
No, I'm saying we already know everything about management consulting.
>>> <<<
How can you be so sure I can't help you when you don't know what my advice will be?
>>> <<<
Okay, you're hired. What's your advice?
>>> <<<
Beats me. I'll have to ask my management consultant.
>>>
2007-07-07 * 
Give me a sand wedge. <<<
This sandwich is all I have for lunch. You can take my pride but not my sandwich!
>>> <<<
I think I'm losing the psychological advantage with my foursome.
>>> mmmph chew-chew-chew! hee-hee!!
>>>
2007-07-06 * 
I'm off to the executive golf tournament. <<<
It just struck me how much contrast there is between your job and mine. Gotta go.
>>> <<<
Let me know if anything else strikes you.
>>>
2007-07-05 * 
<<<
I finished planning the annual executive golf tournament.
>>> <<<
I put all of the cigar smokers in your foursome in case your golf cart has a gas leak.
>>> <<<
Lunch is baked beans and sauerkraut, and I bought you some golf balls made of flint.
>>>
2007-07-04 * 
Maybe I should invite some friends over for a barbecue. <<<
You don't have any friends.
>>> <<<
Good point. Maybe I should make some friends first.
>>> <<<
Exactly.
>>> <<<
Do you like meat?
>>>
2007-07-03 * 
I decided to segment the compensation of different classes of employees. <<<
You'll be in the segment that gets paid the same no matter what you do.
>>> <<<
I call your segment the 'relatively unimportant' segment.
>>> <<<
Catchy.
>>>
2007-07-02 * 
Human resources is a company's most important strategic asset. <<<
That means it's your fault we're losing market share. Maybe you should fire yourself.
>>> <<<
Strategic assets don't like accountability.
>>>
2007-07-01 * 
<<<
Wally, did you complete the benchmark tests?
>>> <<<
No.
>>> slurp <<<
Because?
>>> <<<
Global warming.
>>> <<<
What?
>>> <<<
Well, normally this would have been a pleasant week.
>>> <<<
But thanks to you and your stupid SUV, it was too hot to work.
>>> <<<
Remember, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.
>>> <<<
You work indoors!
>>> <<<
Said the polluter.
>>>
2007-06-30 * 
Dogbert, career counselor <<<
What would you like to do with your degree in...flower arranging?
>>> <<<
I'd like to be a billionaire.
>>> <<<
Are you willing to work hard?
>>> <<<
That would sort of defeat the purpose.
>>>
2007-06-29 * 
Dogbert, career counselor <<<
You have no marketable talent.
>>> <<<
You're totally unemployable and that's not going to change.
>>> <<<
The important thing is to keep a positive attitude.
>>>
2007-06-28 * 
Dogbert, career counselor <<<
Do something you love.
>>> <<<
I love not working.
>>> <<<
Do you have any loves that are any less loserish?
>>> <<<
I love to watch bowling!
>>>
2007-06-27 * 
Nancy, the employee with serious personal problems <<<
The doctors say I need an operation.
>>> <<<
They think my steady diet of licorice and diet soda turned my spleen into a C-4 explosive.
>>> <<<
So I joined a support group. Have you heard of Al Qaeda?
>>> <<<
Gotta go...
>>>
2007-06-26 * 
Nancy, the employee with serious personal problems <<<
I'm in love with a medical school cadaver.
>>> <<<
Do you ever think that maybe your personal problems are caused by your own bad decisions?
>>> <<<
How's it my fault that my boyfriend is acting cold?
>>>
2007-06-25 * 
I hired Nancy because she's had so many personal problems in the past year. <<<
I figure lightning can't strike the same place more than ten or twelve times in a row.
>>> <<<
It's not as if she invites problems.
>>> <<<
I'm in love with a medical school cadaver!
>>>
2007-06-24 * 
<<<
Run this by our attorney.
>>> <<<
May I vigorously hit myself with a hammer instead?
>>> <<<
You have my attention.
>>> <<<
Either way, it's a painful process that won't change the final result.
>>> <<<
But the hammer is quicker and it will still make you feel as if you made me do something.
>>> <<<
Okay. Try the hammer thing.
>>> BAM! <<<
Ouch!
>>> BAM! <<<
Ouch!
>>> BAM! <<<
Ouch!
>>> <<<
Now run it by our attorney so it feels as if I did two things.
>>>
2007-06-23 * 
My job is an endless series of mind-numbingly unimportant tasks. <<<
My central nervous system is starting to atrophy.
>>> <<<
I'm kind of busy.
>>> <<<
Punch me in the head so I can feel something.
>>>
2007-06-22 * 
<<<
Alice, may I ask you a question? Alice? Alice?
>>> <<<
Gaaa! Am I so unimportant you feel no need to acknowledge my existence???
>>> <<<
Am I totally unimportant?
>>> <<<
Hey, it's a bunch of talking clothes!
>>>
2007-06-21 * 
Dogbert the green consultant <<<
Your coworkers have identified you as a source of methane.
>>> <<<
If we capture this free source of energy we can power a small office building.
>>> <<<
I give and I give.
>>>
2007-06-20 * 
Dogbert the green consultant <<<
Try ramming your SUV into hybrid cars.
>>> <<<
That should stop them from using fuel altogether.
>>> <<<
You can't save the Earth unless you're willing to make other people sacrifice.
>>> <<<
I'm in.
>>>
2007-06-19 * 
Dogbert the Green Consultant <<<
Stop eating, breathing, driving, defecating, and procreating.
>>> <<<
Sit in the dark and decompose on some garden seeds.
>>> <<<
Or do you admit you hate Earth?
>>> <<<
A little.
>>>
2007-06-18 * 
One way to save the planet is to drive a fuel-efficient car. <<<
Another way is to give bad advice to some idiot so he gets fired and no longer commutes.
>>> <<<
You should get a license to sell real estate.
>>> <<<
Really?
>>>
2007-06-17 * 
<<<
Gaaa! That idiot is whistling in his cube again!!!
>>> <<<
I would complain but I don't like confrontation.
>>> <<<
I can't talk to his boss because I would appear whiney.
>>> <<<
There's only one solution.
>>> <<<
Alice, please stop by my cubicle when you get a second.
>>> <<<
What's up? Wait. I'll be right back.
>>> <<<
STOP WHISTLING, YOU FREAKIN' MORON!!!
>>> <<<
What's up?
>>> <<<
Never mind. I found a work-around.
>>>
2007-06-16 * 
<<<
Remember to charge your time to the appropriate project code.
>>> <<<
Unless your project is unfunded, in which case the time codes won't work and you'll need to falsify your time report.
>>> <<<
Are any of our projects funded?
>>> <<<
This is the embarrassing part.
>>>
2007-06-15 * 
Run a simulation of our productivity if we lost half our workforce to a pandemic. <<<
Should I assume we lose the productive people or the people who ask other people to run pandemic simulations?
>>> <<<
Try both ways?
>>> <<<
Okay. I'm done.
>>>
2007-06-14 * 
<<<
What does my forehead say?
>>> <<<
I keep forgetting my password, so I wrote it on my head.
>>> <<<
Is your password 123?
>>> <<<
I just said I don't know.
>>>
2007-06-13 * 
CEO Visit <<<
It's important that you have a passion for your job.
>>> <<<
For example, my passion involves working you like rented mules so I can afford to purchase luxury items.
>>> <<<
I bought a ping-pong table with the raise you didn't get.
>>>
2007-06-12 * 
CEO Visit <<<
My meetings go faster when I set the tone.
>>> <<<
Opinions are treason.
>>> <<<
Do you have any opinions, Doofy?
>>>
2007-06-11 * 
<<<
This week I mapped and gapped the requirements to consolidate everything into a program of work...
>>> <<<
...to maximize synergy capture and optimize our resource utilization.
>>> <<<
If any of that sounded like work, I'll do some more of it next week.
>>>
2007-06-10 * 
<<<
Is your plan consistent with our corporate strategy?
>>> <<<
How would I know?
>>> <<<
Don't you know our strategy?
>>> <<<
No. Do you?
>>> <<<
Of course I do. It's something about leveraging our platforms.
>>> <<<
Does your plan leverage our platforms?
>>> <<<
No, but I can rewrite my plan so it seems as if it does.
>>> <<<
Good. Go back and do that.
>>> <<<
There's no point in having a strategy if you aren't going to pretend to follow it.
>>>
2007-06-09 * 
I need this software to do my job. <<<
The software budget is spent. Just share a computer with someone who has this software.
>>> <<<
Why don't you take your tiny mittens and a thermometer to hell and wait for a sign that it's your turn.
>>>
2007-06-08 * 
<<<
Happy birthday. What's it feel like to be 50?
>>> <<<
It's great! I've never felt better in my entire life!
>>> <<<
So it's sort of a delusional thing?
>>> <<<
Yes, luckily.
>>>
2007-06-07 * 
Managing is a lot easier now that we've given up on winning one of those 'Best Places to Work' awards. <<<
Do you have a minute?
>>> <<<
Not for losers.
>>> <<<
There was a time when I wouldn't have known how to handle that situation.
>>>
2007-06-06 * 
The new dress code is a thin film of oil. <<<
We're consolidating offices and we need to fit twenty people in each cubicle.
>>> <<<
They've pretty much given up on winning one of those awards for best places to work.
>>>
2007-06-05 * 
I heard your company is funding terrorists. <<<
Very indirectly.
>>> <<<
And they aren't the bad kind of terrorists. They're more like rebels who sometimes do terrorist things.
>>> <<<
How did they brainwash you so fast?
>>> <<<
Iran supplied them with PowerPoint.
>>>
2007-06-04 * 
<<<
I reached an agreement with the rebels so they won't attack our factory in Elbonia.
>>> <<<
It's a stock swap. Every time they collect a ransom, the value of our company will increase.
>>> <<<
Doesn't that make us terrorists?
>>> <<<
Very indirectly.
>>>
2007-06-03 * 
CEO Meeting <<<
I brought Dilbert in case you have any technical questions.
>>> <<<
What's the status on the technology platform migration project?
>>> <<<
Be completely honest. We have nothing to hide.
>>> <<<
Well, okay.
>>> <<<
The project is like a hundred drunken clowns with bees in their underpants.
>>> <<<
I expect the decline in morale to lead to violence.
>>> <<<
Most of us are only pretending to work while secretly hoping the project gets canceled after you get fired by the board.
>>> <<<
It turns out that we did have a few things to hide.
>>>
2007-06-02 * 
Rebel negotiations <<<
Your price to not attack our Elbonian factory is too high.
>>> <<<
We can give you the senior citizen discount.
>>> *snort* <<<
That's just mean.
>>> <<<
Sorry. I'll switch to more observational humor.
>>>
2007-06-01 * 
Rebels have threatened to attack our Elbonian factory unless we give them a million dollars. <<<
That's outrageous! Tell them their competition offered to not attack us for half that price.
>>> Negotiations begin <<<
That wouldn't even cover our costs of not attacking!
>>>
2007-05-31 * 
I got a text message from our boss. <<<
'Keep up wrk'" <<<
What does that mean?
>>> <<<
You just got your annual performance review.
>>>
2007-05-30 * 
<<<
Have fun working while I'm home chewing on your computer cables.
>>> <<<
I'll probably start with a USB cable appetizer, then do the Ethernet cable with blue cheese dressing.
>>> <<<
Then I'm going to wrap my colon around some coax.
>>> <<<
I envy you, and it's disturbing.

2007-05-29 *

Today you will wear clothes you don't want to wear.

You'll drive somewhere you don't want to be, and do things you don't want to do.

Have a nice day.

I represent the law firm of Dogbert, Dogbert, and more Dogbert.

Your company's web page steals people's cursors and puts them in your own search field.

And my suit is too tight. When you put it all together, I might have to kill you.

<<<
The best choice for employee of the month is...
>>> <<<
Congratulations to Alice for being our employee of the month!
>>> <<<
You get to use my parking spot near the entrance for the rest of the month.
>>> <<<
I take public transit to work.
>>> <<<
You also get to take the rest of today off.
>>> <<<
It's already five o'clock, and you said I need to finish my project by tomorrow morning.
>>> <<<
And you get to have pizza with me.
>>> <<<
I'm on a @#$% low carb diet!!!
>>> <<<
I nailed it.
>>> PIZZA
2007-05-26 * 
<<<
Dilbert, do you have some time to help me with this technical analysis?
>>> <<<
Sure, if you'll go to my house and mow my lawn so this doesn't become a lopsided relationship.
>>> <<<
Why must you be so difficult to abuse?
>>> <<<
Go spit in your socks.
>>>
2007-05-25 * 
<<<
I'm so busy it feels as if my head will explode.
>>> <<<
Ted, one more thing...
>>> KABOOM! <<<
Clean up on aisle three.
>>>
2007-05-24 * 
<<<
Asok, you need to have more of a winner's mentality.
>>> <<<
If I had that sort of thing, why would I work here?
>>> <<<
Ideally, we want you to be dumb and optimistic at the same time.
>>>
2007-05-23 * 
<<<
I had a productive time at the management retreat.
>>> <<<
We golfed as hard as we could until we came up with a new vision for the company!!!
>>> <<<
But no one wrote it down, so we're going to try again next month.
>>>
2007-05-22 * 
<<<
Did you get all of the department heads to sign off on our business plan?
>>> <<<
No, they prefer to see us fail so they look good in comparison and there's more money in the budget for them.
>>> <<<
How can we speed up this process?
>>> <<<
I'm failing as fast as I can.
>>>
2007-05-21 * 
<<<
You have a pattern of raising no objections to plans and later acting as if you opposed them from the start.
>>> <<<
I hope to thwart you by asking you to sign off on this plan in writing.
>>> <<<
Ooh, if only you had asked me before my hands got stuck in these coffee mugs.
>>>
2007-05-20 * 
<<<
Every project you worked on this year got canceled after the reorganization.
>>> <<<
It's as if you didn't even exist.
>>> <<<
That's not entirely true.
>>> <<<
For example, I occupied space.
>>> <<<
I'd like to see someone who doesn't exist do that.
>>> <<<
A dead person can occupy space.
>>> <<<
But a dead person exists.
>>> <<<
I won the argument, but it was a hollow victory.

Ted, I need you to work late every night until we catch up.

You'll also need to work every weekend.
>>> <<<
What about my family?
>>> <<<
They had a good run.
>>>
2007-05-18 * 
<<<
Carol, you showed up for work almost every day this week. Here are some 'morale dollars'.
>>> <<<
It's not real money, but you can redeem it for gifts and services that you don't want or need.
>>> <<<
I also entered you into a raffle that you didn't win.
>>> HONK!

I can monitor the company's key metrics from my executive dashboard. <<<
Uh-oh. I need to do a better job of falsifying my data.
>>> <<<
Allow me to set the stage for your next assignment by reminding you that stockholders have never done anything for you.
>>>
2007-05-16 * 
Dogbert consults <<<
You need a dashboard application to track your key metrics.
>>> <<<
That way you'll have more data to ignore when you make your decisions based on company politics.

Will the data be accurate?

Okay, let's pretend that matters.

I asked Disgruntled Doug to work on our pricing model. <<<
The fate of the entire company rests in his tiny hands.

That reminds me: I gave your cubicle to an intern.

But don't worry. I have another workspace for you.

You can use this little cardboard box that the laser printer came in.

It's only temporary.

Give me a list of all the software and hardware you're using.

This completes my presentation. <<<
Does anyone have a question designed to increase my workload for your entertainment?

How much money would the company save if you did the entire project by yourself?

Hmmm...

2007-05-09 * 
<<<
Wally, you have attended thousands of meetings and never gotten an action item. What is your secret?

When the action items are handed out, I use a certain facial expression to ward them off.

2007-05-08 *

Why don't you answer my e-mails? Do I need to complain to your boss?

Yes, do that right away.

Do what?

Can I ignore e-mail from people who don't include my original message in their reply?
>>> <<<
Yes, and you can hate them, too.
>>> <<<
90% of happiness is picking the right ethicist.

2007-05-06 * 
<<<
Can I ask you a question?
>>> <<<
Sure, new guy.
>>> <<<
How long do I need to work here before...
>>> <<<
...the dark cloud of hopelessness and despair begins to lift?
>>> <<<
I keep expecting the feeling to go away any minute.
>>> <<<
I was hoping to achieve job satisfaction within a month.

Once that happens, I figure that total self-actualization can't be far behind.

I'd give it another day or two.

Any minute now.

My side job as a cartoonist is doing well, so this is my resignation.
>>> <<<
My new career involves sitting around in my pajamas and thinking of ways to ridicule you.

Actually, it's not so much a letter of resignation as it is a drawing of your body with a manure head.
>>>
2007-05-04 * 
You can't have a side job of drawing a comic strip about the workplace. <<<
I should fire you for mocking the management of this company in newspapers.
>>> <<<
Because then I'd mock you less?
>>>
2007-05-03 * 
<<<
I heard that you started a comic strip on the side.

You're in my seat, fly bait. Move or I'll pound your head so hard you'll have to remove your pants to read.

Did I miss anything about teamwork?

Where do you get your ideas?

2007-05-02 * 
We have a report of a cartoonist in Cubicle 45950. His comics might embarrass the company. <<<
We can't fire him because it would look bad. You must give him absurd assignments until he quits.

Automakers prove their design skills by creating concept cars that will never go into production.

Is it true that half of the department will be outsourced?

Before you answer, I should tell you that I've made a list...

...of all the responses that mean the same as yes.

For example, if you say, 'Ignore the rumors,' that means yes.

Also on the list are, 'Why do you ask?' and, 'Who told you that?'" <<<
That list is stupid.

I did a trademark search on all of the excellent product names you suggested.

So I did a search on the names that weren't so great.

Those are taken, too.

Then I checked on the names iCrud, iPuke, EatDirtAndDie, and DefectiveProduct.

All taken.

So our new product name will be a combination of grunts and shrieks.

I had to collect some DNA.

E-mail me with your comments on the design.

Can't I just tell you my comments now?

That's just burning daylight.

In fact, I'm thinking of killing you right now just in case you already invented it and you're trying to decide whether you should tell me.

Some batteries in the lab leaked.

So I put it between two pieces of bread and left it in the break room refrigerator.

You will all attend a four-hour training session on how to write goals.

Those reports will be entered into a giant database.

Won't the size and complexity of the database make it impossible to know what's really happening?

No. I doubt I would even prepare a speech.

>>> <<<
I don't like to disappoint people.
>>> <<<
What the @#$% do you think I am now?!
>>> <<<
Hey, I think I'm starting to like disappointing people!
>>>
2007-03-07 * 
<<<
Wally, too many people are asking me for things. How can I set priorities?
>>> <<<
Wait until everyone is yelling at you and then help whoever makes the scariest threat on any given day.
>>> <<<
Is that what you do?
>>> <<<
No, I tell people to go ask you.
>>>
2007-03-06 * 
<<<
I spent this entire week unscrewing the problems created by your ambiguous communication.
>>> <<<
Next week I hope to unscrew the problems created by your hiring of morons.
>>> <<<
Moving on, I've made some changes to the budget.
>>> <<<
There goes April.
>>>
2007-03-05 * 
Have you signed Ted's get well card yet? <<<
Don't leave that here. Ted passed away two weeks ago. How long have you had the card on your desk?
>>> <<<
Have you signed Ted's get well card yet?
>>> <<<
Put it on the pile.
>>>
2007-03-04 * 
<<<
May I see the vacation schedule?
>>> <<<
Why do you want it?
>>> <<<
No reason.
>>> <<<
Well, Ted, I hope you're enjoying your vacation.
>>> <<<
Wally, do you have the cost estimates?
>>> <<<
I'm waiting for Ted's input. He's on vacation.
>>> <<<
How about the revised time-line?
>>> <<<
I'm waiting for Ted.
>>> <<<
Do you need any office supplies? I'm going to the store.
>>> <<<
Maybe some pens.
>>> TED <<<
Limited selection but excellent prices.
>>> <<<
Thanks.
>>> <<<
So, I understand you have a vacation next week.
>>>
2007-03-03 * 
<<<
Alice, you've been accused of punching a crazy co-worker.
>>> <<<
In my defense, it did make her less crazy.
>>> <<<
I know. Here's a list of additional crazy employees I'd like you to punch.
>>>
2007-03-02 * 
Dilbert totally flipped out when I showed him the cost estimates. <<<
Really? Or is this one of those cases where someone acts normally and you inexplicably tell the world that they totally flipped out?
>>> <<<
Whoa! Don't flip out.
>>> <<<
I wonder if I can punch her sane.
>>>
2007-03-01 * 
<<<
Do your estimates include tax and shipping?
>>> <<<
Relax, relax, calm down.
>>> <<<
There's no need to go all nuts about the tax and shipping. It's under control. Take a deep breath.
>>> <<<
Um...All I asked was...
>>> <<<
Gaaa! You're totally losing it now!
>>>
2007-02-28 * 
They found asbestos in our ceiling. We're all in danger. <<<
I must use my telekinesis to remove the asbestos.
>>> <<<
GAAA!
>>> <<<
The threat has been neutralized. You must never ask me how it was done.
>>> <<<
I'm not even curious.
>>>
2007-02-27 * 
<<<
The employees are getting all whiney about the asbestos in the ceiling.
>>> <<<
I told them it wasn't dangerous, but apparently I'm not credible in this HazMat suit.
>>> <<<
I don't think it's fair that they judge me by my clothes.
>>>
2007-02-26 * 
The facilities people tell me there's asbestos in the ceiling. <<<
They say you don't need to worry about it unless it gets disturbed.
>>> <<<
They plan to disturb it today.
>>>
2007-02-25 * 
<<<
You'll be in charge of this project.
>>> <<<
What's my budget?
>>> <<<
I'll need to approve all expenses.
>>> <<<
Who will report to me?
>>> <<<
Your team will report to me and I'll tell them what to do.
>>> <<<
I'll start on the project plan.
>>> <<<
Um...
>>> <<<
Skip that part. I already have a plan in my head.
>>> <<<
Hypothetically, who would take the blame if this project failed?
>>> <<<
Well, you're in charge...
>>>
2007-02-24 * 
Someone left a dead horse in the hall. <<<
I am going to punch that dead horse until it gallops away.
>>> punch punch punch punch <<<
You were right. But where did you find a dead horse?
>>> <<<
There's a store for everything.
>>>
2007-02-23 * 
<<<
Thanks to my P.R. campaign, your stock price is grossly over-inflated.
>>> <<<
Now you can use your stock to buy companies that actually make money.
>>> <<<
After you manage those companies into the toilet, give me a jingle.
>>>
2007-02-22 * 
<<<
I hope you don't expect me to write a favorable article about your company just because you bought me drinks.
>>> <<<
No, I expect you to publish my press release and act like you wrote it.
>>> <<<
You can work or you can get drunk, but the pay is exactly the same.
>>>
2007-02-21 * 
Dogbert does public relations <<<
You can't get free publicity simply by doing something better.
>>> <<<
You have to do something in a way that has never been done.
>>> <<<
It's a Sir Richard Branson sort of thing. You wouldn't understand.
>>>
2007-02-20 * 
Dogbert does public relations <<<
Our products are made by asthmatic dwarves. You should do a story on that.
>>> <<<
Not enough? Okay, what if the dwarves are also polygamous serial killers?
>>> <<<
When you talk to the reporter, try to slouch, wheeze, and act henpicked to the point of homicide.
>>>
2007-02-19 * 
<<<
I hired the Dogbert public relations firm to get us some free publicity.
>>> <<<
I've already told the media that your products are deadly and we're voluntarily recalling everything.
>>> <<<
But...they aren't deadly.
>>> <<<
Hey, I don't tell you how to be fat.
>>> snork
2007-02-18 * 
Catbert: <<<
Evil Director of Human Resources <<<
The new company health plan is Google.
>>> <<<
From now on, employees must use Google to diagnose their own illnesses.
>>> <<<
For example, this guy has a growth on his neck.
>>> <<<
I do?
>>> <<<
A quick search on my Blackberry tells me it's...
>>> <<<
What is it?!!
>>> <<<
Ooh. Wow.
>>> <<<
A pregnant termite crawled into your mouth and built a hive in your esophagus.
>>> <<<
GAAA!!!
>>> <<<
Stop being a baby. The treatment for that is...
>>> <<<
Do you have an arc welder and a barrel of kerosene?
>>>
2007-02-17 * 
<<<
Alice, I have some good ideas about your project.
>>> <<<
GAAA! Why me?
>>> <<<
Why must I suffer your ideas? Why, why, why?!
>>> <<<
You're not a good listener.
>>> <<<
SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME!
>>>
2007-02-16 * 
Who needs a little management help on their project? <<<
You could almost feel the teamwork in the air.
>>>
2007-02-15 * 
How's your project coming along? <<<
It's a streaming pile of failure.
>>> <<<
It's like fifteen drunken monkeys with a jigsaw puzzle.
>>> <<<
How's your project coming along?
>>> <<<
Fine.
>>>
2007-02-14 * 
Catbert: <<<
Evil Director of Human Resources <<<
Employee Appreciation Day is next Tuesday. The cover charge is $25 apiece.

How do we know you won't buy cheap hot dogs and pocket the rest of our money?
>>> <<<
Every day it gets harder to appreciate you.

2007-02-13 * 
<<<
He was violating my personal space and his head got stuck in my ear.
>>> <<<
You need a huge yawn to open the ear canal so he can get out.
>>> <<<
Yes, I do have lots of pictures of my porcelain frog collection. Why do you ask?
>>>
2007-02-12 * 
<<<
Then I said...
>>> <<<
He is totally violating my personal space with his non-standard facial hair.
>>> <<<
HA! HA! HA! HA!
>>> <<<
Gaaa!!! His warm, moist breath is all over me!
>>> <<<
Please stop touching my brain with your nose.
>>>
2007-02-11 * 
<<<
Our travel budget is shot.
>>> <<<
We'll take money out of the training budget.
>>> <<<
We need training to support our new product.
>>> <<<
We'll use the software budget for training.
>>> <<<
We need to do a mandatory software upgrade.
>>> <<<
Fine. Move some money from teh travel budget to the software budget.
>>> <<<
Geez, you people do nothing but complain. Meanwhile I'm managing my brains out.
>>> <<<
I wondered what happened to them.
>>> <<<
Happened to what?
>>>
2007-02-10 * 
<<<
I'm concerned that you might be low-balling your goals for the coming year.
>>> <<<
For example, this one says you will 'decompose in your chair'.
>>> <<<
That sounds easy.
>>> <<<
Not really. Half of the time I'm in a different chair.
>>>
2007-02-09 * 
<<<
I wrote out my goals for the coming year.
>>> <<<
I set them higher than I can achieve because our boss said it's good to have stretch goals.
>>> <<<
Well, more for us.
>>>
2007-02-08 * 
<<<
Wally, what are your goals for the coming year?
>>> <<<
My goal is to replace my soul with coffee and become immortal.
>>> <<<
I mean something about work.
>>> <<<
Oh, I thought you said MY goals.
>>>
2007-02-07 * 
You said to tell you if marketing wasn't cooperating. <<<
You can't come running to me with every little problem. Go fix it.
>>> <<<
Then why did you tell me to tell you?!
>>> <<<
It's just something I say.
>>>
2007-02-06 * 
Congratulations on 20 years of service. Here's a pen with the company's logo. <<<
I have one just like it. At least I think this one is mine. I might have gotten them mixed up.
>>> <<<
Which one looks like it spent the least time in my ear?
>>>
2007-02-05 * 
<<<
Do you mind if I apply for the opening in R&D?
>>> <<<
Hey, I just applied for the manager job there?
>>> <<<
Um...maybe I'll wait.
>>> <<<
To make sure I'll be your boss?
>>> <<<
Ooo-kay...
>>> <<<
This must be what bonding feels like.
>>>
2007-02-04 * 
<<<
I'd like to kick off the project by assigning blame for its eventual failure.
>>> <<<
Shouldn't we do that after the project is over?
>>> <<<
I see no reason to wait.
>>> <<<
Well...okay.
>>> <<<
Our boss will make us use the wrong vendor.
>>> <<<
Wally won't do any work. Alice will alienate the client, and Ted is generally worthless.
>>> <<<
In summary, my excellent work will be rendered moot by nincompoops.
>>> <<<
Do you even work here?
>>> <<<
No, I was just in the neighborhood.
>>>
2007-02-03 * 
<<<
There's a job opening for an engineer in research and development!
>>> <<<
It's a chance to escape the mismanaged futility of my current job and live the dream!
>>> <<<
Hey, there's an opening for a new manager of research and development!
>>>
2007-02-02 * 
<<<
Why did you add this button to the user interface?
>>> <<<
You told me to.
>>> <<<
Why would I tell you that?
>>> <<<
You always suggest random changes to create the illusion of adding value.
>>> <<<
Well, remove that button.
>>> <<<
It's only on your copy.
>>>
2007-02-01 * 
My day will start out great if I can make it to my cubicle without human contact. <<<
AAYI-YI-YI-YI!
>>> <<<
I hope that was the sound of teamwork.
>>>
2007-01-31 * 
<<<
Our new philosophy is 'a bias for action'.
>>> <<<
Are we eliminating our Six-Sigma program, the budget cycle, ISO certification, and our approval processes?
>>> <<<
Can I get back to you on that?
>>> <<<
Sure. No rush.
>>>
2007-01-30 * 
<<<
I analyzed the DNA of all of your applicants to find the best fit for the job.
>>> <<<
The most qualified applicant who is willing to work for you has three ears, a snout, and a life expectancy of Thursday.
>>> <<<
Dilbert, meet the new guy. And do it quickly.
>>> cough cough
2007-01-29 * 
Dogbert Consults <<<
Your problem is that you have too many losers on the payroll.
>>> <<<
Luckily I have developed a fool-proof DNA test for identifying losers.
>>> <<<
Well, I'm afraid your DNA doesn't match mine, loser.
>>>
2007-01-28 * 
<<<
I enjoyed meeting your staff. Keep up the good work.
>>> <<<
This isn't my staff. I report to the guy who reports to you.
>>> <<<
Really? Which one of you reports to me?
>>> <<<
Well, that explains why you keep hanging around outside my office.
>>> <<<
I've been going to your office for years, waiting for you to get off the phone so I could talk to you.
>>> <<<
I've been making fake phone calls for years, hoping the weirdo outside my office would go away.
>>> <<<
Keep up the good work.
>>>
2007-01-27 * 
<<<
Asok, your assignment is to buy a display case for our awards.
>>> <<<
Then go to the store and buy a bunch of awards because we don't have any.
>>> <<<
The next one is for 'Best Unethical Filling of an Awards Showcase.'
>>>
2007-01-26 * 
<<<
Can you come to a meeting right now?
>>> <<<
No, it's almost lunch time.
>>> <<<
If I miss lunch, my day will be 12 hours of uninterrupted misery. I will envy the dead.
>>> <<<
That's stupid. The dead don't eat lunch either.

2007-01-25 * 
<<<
I came from a distant planet to bring you advanced technology, but no one here will listen!
>>> <<<
I am a superior being, you moron! Listen to what I tell you and then do it!
>>> <<<
I fired him before he started yammering about Linux.
>>> <<<
Easy come, easy go.
>>>
2007-01-24 * 
I came to this company to bring the technology of my advanced culture to you simpletons. <<<
Has anyone ever told you that your snout is like the handle of a gavel?
>>> <<<
A what?
>>> <<<
How's the new guy working out?
>>> <<<
ORDER IN THE COURT!
>>> BAM BAM BAM
2007-01-23 * 
I am an alien with highly advanced intelligence. I have come to share my genius with this company. <<<
Me too. But they don't like that sort of thing here.
>>> <<<
It's a quagmire.
>>>
2007-01-22 * 
Catbert: <<<
Evil Director of Human Resources <<<
I am a scientist from the planet Zorp. I bring you technologies beyond your imagination.
>>> <<<
All I ask is that you let me work with your engineers to transfer this knowledge.
>>> <<<
They think 'work' means sitting in a fabric-covered container.
>>>
2007-01-21 * 
<<<
From now on, all travel must be booked through the corporate travel web site.
>>> <<<
Our travel web site is terrible.
>>> <<<
It only lets you book the cheapest flight, and that's always on Elbonian Airlines.
>>> <<<
Don't be such a snob. What's wrong with using a discount airline?
>>> <<<
Well, they list their destination airports as 'whatever looks soft'.
>>> <<<
The meals in first class are made of anyone who dies in coach.
>>> <<<
Their entire security screening process involves shouting at each passenger 'Are you Osama bin Laden?!!!'" <<<
And I once saw a baggage handler wearing my dress.
>>> <<<
Whiner.
>>>
2007-01-20 * 
We need to find a way to close the gap between our strategy and our capabilities. <<<
Why don't we just pretend we're good at something and call it our strategy.
>>> <<<
Sorry...Didn't mean to jump ahead.
>>>
2007-01-19 * 
<<<
Carol, schedule a staff meeting.
>>> <<<
What's the topic?
>>> <<<
I plan to fuse Six Sigma with lean methods to eliminate the gap between our strategy and our objectives.
>>> <<<
I'll just say 'Waste of time'.
>>>
2007-01-18 * 
Dogbert's password recovery service for morons <<<
I done forgot my password.
>>> <<<
What's your name?
>>> <<<
My name is Ned, I think.
>>> <<<
Is your password 'Ned'?

Sweet baby jeepers, you're like some sort of Nostrildogmas!
>>> <<<
Here's a brochure for my cult.
>>>
2007-01-17 * 
Dogbert's password recovery service for morons <<<
I don't remember my password.
>>> <<<
Is it '123'?
>>> <<<
That's just spooky.
>>>
2007-01-16 * 
Every week I order sugared doughnuts online and every week they deliver plain doughnuts. <<<
Those aren't plain. Ratbert licks the sugar off of them when they arrive.
>>> <<<
I work in a cubicle. I can get used to this too.

TRA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA!!! <<<
Why do I need a reason?
>>>
2007-01-14 * 
Did you set up my pre-meeting for Wednesday? <<<
Yes. It's on Thursday.
>>> <<<
You scheduled my pre-meeting for the day after the meeting?
>>> <<<
That was the only day that everyone could make it.
>>> <<<
There's no point in having a pre-meeting after the actual meeting.
>>> <<<
Sure there is. You can talk about how much better the meeting would have been if you had been prepared.
>>> <<<
Here comes the pointy-haired boss. You'd better scurry away before he gives you more work.
>>> <<<
There's a fine line between evil and underpaid.
>>>
2007-01-13 * 
Sales Engineer <<<
I've successfully integrated our product with your network.
>>> <<<
It might look as if all I did was run a Cat5 cable through a shoebox full of twigs and leaves.
>>> <<<
Is that all you did?
>>> <<<
A Cat6 cable would be overkill.
>>>
2007-01-12 * 
Your network product appears to be a shoebox full of twigs and leaves. <<<
Ho ho! Just wait until my engineer does his magic and integrates it with your network!
>>> <<<
Make it look like another vendor's fault.
>>>
2007-01-11 * 
Sales Engineer <<<
I did the hard part of making the sale. All you have to do is install it.
>>> <<<
I might have promised them a few extra features.
>>> <<<
Did you bring your own massage table or should I just get naked and sprawl on a desk?
>>>
2007-01-10 * 
<<<
I'm a sales support engineer now. Can you teach me to be a good liar?
>>> <<<
Sure. Meet me on the porch, and don't wear a coat; the cold will help the learning.
>>> <<<
The first lesson is always the cruelest.
>>>
2007-01-09 * 
Sales Engineer <<<
Your sales rep told us that the product heals itself. Is that true?
>>> <<<
It's totally true...that he said that.
>>> <<<
Let me ask this another way...
>>> <<<
NOOO!!! One way per question!
>>>
2007-01-08 * 
<<<
I'm making you a sales engineer. You'll be paid on commission.
>>> <<<
When our sales reps lie, it will be your job to make it look like the truth.
>>> <<<
Try to avoid facts.
>>>
2007-01-07 * 
<<<
Tina, I need you to edit this before I send it out.
>>> <<<
Sure. I could use a good laugh.
>>> <<<
Let's start with the words that aren't words.
>>> <<<
Incentiment...robustify...flexitate...and leadershipping.
>>> <<<
I'll take those out and see what's left.

'If you're not onboard with quality excellence, you're underboard.'" <<<

2007-01-05 * 
My diet is making me too hungry to listen. I hope that doesn't affect the quality of my decisions. <<<
Amortize the depreciation over the bandwidth of the discount rate.

I brought an emergency hoagie.

My doctor says it will be easier if I diet with a buddy. Do you want in on this? <<<
Good lord. I think I just developed an eating disorder!

How's your diet coming along?

MM-GUWUNG-MM-GUH-MUH!

It's hard to pick the one best doughnut I've ever had, but this one is in my top five.

2007-01-02 * 
I should warn you that I'm on a diet and might not have the sharp focus that you've come to expect from me. <<<
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
>>> <<<
I thought of something funny totally on my own.
>>>
2007-01-01 * 
Our meat and potatoes is knowing how to sandwich in our product without causing the other vendors to beef. <<<
We'll get our just desserts when they drink the Kool-Aid. Then we can have our cake and eat it too.
>>> <<<
Are you on a diet?
>>> <<<
Shut your pie hole.
>>>
2006-12-31 * 
I'll ask the vendor for ballpark prices to see if the idea is feasible. <<<
You can't talk with vendors until our change control board approves the project.
>>> <<<
But that would require a cost-benefit analysis.
>>> <<<
And I can't do that without ballpark prices from the vendor.
>>> <<<
Just take your best guess.
>>> <<<
So...I should make up a number so I can get approval to make a phone call and ask what the number should have been?
>>> <<<
Right. But first you need to get my approval to do the cost-benefit analysis.
>>> <<<
Will you approve it?
>>> <<<
I'd have to see the numbers.
>>>
2006-12-30 * 
<<<
Women know all about diets. Which one should I use?
>>> <<<
Should I go with the one that makes me miserable and doesn't work, or the one that might kill me?
>>> <<<
If you do both, I won't ask for anything on National Secretary's Day.
>>>
2006-12-29 * 
<<<
Is it true that you allowed a vampire to run the blood drive?
>>> <<<
Yes, and it takes a big man to admit he's wrong.
>>> <<<
You admit you were wrong?
>>> <<<
I decided to lose weight.
>>>
2006-12-28 * 
<<<
Vlad is here to tell us why it's so important to donate blood.
>>> <<<
Blood is totally delicious and I'm too lazy to bite necks.

You're not with the Red Cross, are you.
>>> <<<
Competition is healthy too.
>>>
2006-12-27 * 
All attempts to train you have failed. <<<
But I don't want to fire you because there's a hiring freeze and I can't backfill.
>>> <<<
So I've decided to scale back your responsibilities.
>>> <<<
Where do you want these?
>>>
2006-12-26 * 
<<<
We don't pay enough to attract qualified employees.
>>> <<<
No problem. I'll hire unqualified people with good attitudes and train them.
>>> <<<
Dilbert, when you get a second, train this guy.
>>> <<<
Yay!
>>>
2006-12-25 * 
<<<
I found a way to save a million dollars by spending only $10,000.
>>> <<<
The $10,000 would come out of my budget but the savings would go into someone else's budget. It's not feasible.

Our stockholders might disagree.
>>> <<<
That's why they aren't invited to meetings.
>>>
2006-12-24 * 
<<<
I'll be right back after I return these dishes to the cafeteria.
>>> <<<
Whoa, whoa!
>>> <<<
Winners don't return dishes to the cafeteria.
>>> <<<
Then how do the dishes get back?
>>> <<<
You must use your power of low standards.
>>> <<<
Just place the dishes on the floor and wait for a loser with high standards.
>>> <<<
Gaaa! Dishes on the floor!
>>> <<<
Once again I have to clean up after slobs!
>>> <<<
It is like a miracle.
>>> <<<
Now ask her to bring you back a yogurt.
>>>
2006-12-23 * 
I heard that the guy you voted for just confessed to having an affair with a squirrel. <<<
Shut up. The guy you voted for is being sued for choking his secretary.
>>> <<<
In some countries they don't get a choice of who to vote for.
>>> <<<
I feel sorry for them.
>>>
2006-12-22 * 
There's an article in the paper about that guy you voted for. <<<
He's having an affair with a squirrel.
>>> <<<
Want to talk politics?
>>> <<<
Shut up.

Bob, the unluckiest insurance agent. <<<
Our hazard coverage is second to none!

Don't flee down the stairwell. The steps are made of asbestos.

Bob, the unluckiest insurance agent. <<<
You're making a good decision.
>>> GAAAK!
>>>
2006-12-19 * 
<<<
Tina seems mad at you. What's that about?
>>> <<<
She thought I did something rude, but when she found out I didn't, she still had residual anger.
>>> <<<
I wonder what it's like to have squirrels living in your skull.
>>>
2006-12-18 * 
<<<
I got your overly brief e-mail, which obviously means you hate me and everything I stand for!
>>> <<<
I was in a hurry and didn't want to make you wait for a reply.
>>> <<<
Well, okay, but I still have residual hatred that I'll need to transfer to some other aspect of your personality.
>>> <<<
Fair enough.
>>>
2006-12-17 * 
<<<
You missed the meeting.
>>> <<<
What meeting?
>>> <<<
The budget meeting that you told me to schedule.
>>> <<<
You never told me when it was.
>>> <<<
I sent you an e-mail.
>>> <<<
Well, obviously you chose an uninteresting subject line.
>>> <<<
Otherwise I would have opened it.
>>> <<<
You're a bad e-mail sender.
>>> <<<
I also told you in person.
>>> <<<
Boringly?
>>>
2006-12-16 * 
<<<
Wally, if I give you an assignment, what are the odds that you will actually do it right?
>>> <<<
If I put my mind to a task, I do it well.
>>> <<<
Will you put your mind to it?
>>> <<<
Wow. Good follow-up question.
>>>
2006-12-15 * 
The director of marketing needs an engineering resource. <<<
I'm giving you to him because I hate his stupid guts.
>>> <<<
What did I do to deserve this?
>>> <<<
Sorry I'm late. I had to drown a burrito.
>>>
2006-12-14 * 
And the point of my presentation is that these titanium tubes will... BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!!! <<<
It's for you.
>>>
2006-12-13 * 
I worked on my own time to invent a room-temperature superconductor that could eliminate our need for oil. <<<
You were supposed to be finding a new vendor for toner cartridges. What happened to that?
>>> <<<
Must...not use...telekinesis...
>>> <<<
Why does my necktie seem so...ERK!!!
>>>
2006-12-12 * 
Flashback: <<<
Indian Institute of Technology. <<<
Your telekinesis grades are very good, young Asok.
>>> <<<
Always remember that you may not use your powers in front of the ungifted.
>>> Present Day <<<
What the...? I just blinked and the last doughnut disappeared!
>>>
2006-12-11 * 
I need your comments on this before I submit it. <<<
Just leave it here and hope I become the sort of boss who gets around to doing that sort of thing.
>>> <<<
Did someone tell you that hope works?
>>>
2006-12-10 * 
<<<
This is Dogbert's tech support. How may I abuse you?
>>> <<<
I get an error message every time I open an application.
>>> <<<
Try giving me all of your personal information and then checking into rehab.
>>> <<<
Then I'll have someone steal your identity and move in with your wife.
>>> <<<
There's a good chance that the new guy will know how to fix your computer.
>>> <<<
When you get out of rehab, talk your wife into taking you back.
>>> <<<
Then never touch your computer again because it hurts the ones you love.
>>> <<<
How's work?
>>> <<<
Everyone wants to talk to my supervisor.
>>>
2006-12-09 * 
I found a family of squirrels living inside our legacy system. <<<
They control our payroll database. They're making demands.
>>> <<<
Leave the acorns and no one will get their deductions increased.
>>>
2006-12-08 * 
Carl quit. He's the only one who knows how to program the legacy system. <<<
It can't be that hard. Go figure it out.
>>> ? <<<
Frack.
>>>
2006-12-07 * 
You work in a cubicle while your routers and servers have a private office with their own climate control. <<<
The machines have taken over. Your job is to provide them with electricity.
>>> <<<
And do you think those electronic voting machines care about your opinion?
>>>
2006-12-06 * 
<<<
Hey, is that a new candy dish?
>>> <<<
Yes, it is.
>>> <<<
GET YOUR HAND AWAY FROM MY @#$% CANDY!
>>> <<<
I love the new candy dish.

Catbert: <<<
Evil Director of Human Resources <<<
Every absence counts as one 'occurrence' whether it is one day or more.
>>> <<<
I just got a headache. I'll see you in a year. Or as I like to call it, one occurrence.
>>> <<<
If something is worth having, it's worth abusing.
>>>
2006-12-04 * 
<<<
It's stressful to be a contract employee. I only get paid for the hours I work.
>>> <<<
I can't enjoy my time off because it feels as if it costs me a fortune!
>>> <<<
Do you know what I mean?
>>> <<<
Yeah, I had a feeling once.
>>>
2006-12-03 * 
<<<
Alice, you need to use up your vacation days before the end of the year.
>>> <<<
You told me I had to finish my project before the end of the year.
>>> <<<
I have 19 vacation days to use and there are 19 work days left in the year.
>>> <<<
That leaves zero days to do 19 days worth of work.
>>> <<<
You could work on weekends and use weekdays for vacation.
>>> <<<
Why the @#$% would I do that?!!
>>> <<<
Because vacations reduce your stress. Duh.
>>> <<<
You'd think that would be obvious.
>>> <<<
AAIEEE!!!
>>> PUNCH!!!
>>>
2006-12-02 * 
<<<
Our CEO is here to answer any of your questions about our restatement of earnings.
>>> <<<
Will you return your $25,000,000 bonus from last year, now that you acknowledge it was unearned?
>>> <<<
And what's your name?
>>> <<<
Dilbert.
>>>
2006-12-01 * 
<<<
...And I work there as an engineer.
>>> <<<
Go away. I lost $3,000 when your company restated its earnings.
>>> <<<
Tonight I was rejected for corporate malfeasance.
>>> <<<
I'll add it to the list.
>>>
2006-11-30 * 
Today the company restated its earnings from 'a few frillion' to 'a loss of 1.3 billion'. <<<
This would be humiliating if I had any friends.
>>> <<<
Your strategy of being unattractive is paying off.
>>> <<<
I'm ugly like a fox.
>>>
2006-11-29 * 
We might need to restate our earnings. <<<
It turns out that we're not allowed to make up numbers.
>>> <<<
Did you know that 'frillion' isn't an actual number?
>>>
2006-11-28 * 
I've been trying for six months to solve this engineering problem. It might be impossible. <<<
Just turn it sideways and it will fit perfectly.
>>> <<<
Okay...Now I have to kill you.
>>>
2006-11-27 * 
<<<
Did you tell Asok to get our client a 'little bit pregnant'?
>>> <<<
Yes.
>>> <<<
Well, he doesn't understand all of our American sayings.
>>> <<<
I don't know what this is all about, but I'm in.
>>>
2006-11-26 * 
<<<
Our company has decided to try something new.
>>> Six Sigma <<<
New? Six Sigma was developed in the 80s.
>>> <<<
It's new to us.
>>> <<<
Why don't we jump on a fad that hasn't already been widely discredited?
>>> <<<
That way the false hope might sustain us.
>>> <<<
There's nothing wrong with Six Sigma. All it does is reduce defects!
>>> <<<
Let's see...Fortune Magazine sys...blah, blah...Most companies that used Six Sigma have trailed the S&P 500.
>>> <<<
Sorry I'm late. What did I miss while I was innovating?
>>>
2006-11-25 * 
<<<
When I was a kid, we didn't have any cell phones, iPods, video games, or computers.
>>> <<<
I played outside. My only toy was tree bark.
>>> <<<
Were you raised by squirrels?
>>> <<<
No, I'm just mature.
>>>
2006-11-24 * 
<<<
Asok, this is Albert. He's old but we need to call him mature.
>>> <<<
Explain to him what the computers are, but don't let him touch anything. The elderly like to fiddle.
>>> <<<
I was a chip designer in my last job.
>>> <<<
Really? Chocolate or poker?
>>>
2006-11-23 * 
<<<
Dilbert, meet Albert. He's old, but I like to call him experienced.
>>> <<<
I'm trying to win an award for being one of the best places to work if you have one foot in the grave.
>>> <<<
I'm only 54. I ran a marathon yesterday.
>>> <<<
I asked the cafeteria to stock up on food that's easy to gum.
>>>
2006-11-22 * 
What happens if I add the lies from marketing to my boss's assumptions...then factor in some reality? KABOOM! <<<
Stupid reality.
>>>
2006-11-21 * 
Does marketing have any data on customer preferences? Errr grunt! <<<
This is disturbing on so many levels.
>>>
2006-11-20 * 
<<<
I don't like to judge people by their looks, but I'm going to make an exception for you.
>>> <<<
Something tells me that you and I will be butting heads.
>>> <<<
I have a degree in marketing.
>>> <<<
Why aren't your lips moving?
>>>
2006-11-19 * 
First Date <<<
Do you feel like doing some conversation?
>>> <<<
Okay. I love talking.
>>> <<<
Do you like politics?
>>> <<<
No.
>>> <<<
Science and technology?
>>> <<<
Not really.
>>> <<<
War?
>>> <<<
No.
>>> <<<
Sports?
>>> <<<
No.
>>> <<<
Current events?
>>> <<<
No.
>>> <<<
What's left?
>>> <<<
I like to talk about my hair.
>>> <<<
Um...okay, we can try that.
>>> <<<
This brown is a browner brown than I wanted.
>>> <<<
Right. Are we done with hair?
>>>
2006-11-18 * 
You haven't given me enough resources to do my project. <<<
That's because your project isn't important and neither are you.
>>> <<<
This took an ugly turn.
>>> <<<
Would you mind not exhaling so much in my office?
>>>
2006-11-17 * 
<<<
Our project scope has vastly expanded, so we'll all need to pull together as a team.
>>> <<<
Is it too late for me to bail out before this project becomes a blight on my career?
>>> <<<
I already put the team photo on our coffee cups.
>>> <<<
GAAA!!!
>>>
2006-11-16 * 
<<<
Tina, you were only supposed to document our product status, not rewrite the entire scope.
>>> <<<
Our CEO loves the new project scope. We'll expect you to do that without extra resources.
>>> <<<
Is this a 'neener-neener' situation or more of a 'Who's your daddy?'?
>>>
2006-11-15 * 
<<<
They're filming a movie downtown. I just saw Brad Pitt!
>>> <<<
That's nothing.
>>> <<<
I once used too much fake tanning spray and the next thing I knew, Brad and Angelina adopted me.
>>> <<<
You're saying Angelina Jolie is your mom?
>>> <<<
Until I talked her out of bottle feeding.
>>>
2006-11-14 * 
Topper <<<
My first baby weighed 11 pounds.
>>> <<<
That's nothing.
>>> <<<
I once passed a kidney stone that was the size of a small horse.
>>> <<<
I find that hard to believe.
>>> <<<
That kidney stone went on to win the Kentucky Derby!
>>>
2006-11-13 * 
Return of Topper <<<
Then we started taking RPG fire from a rooftop.
>>> <<<
That's nothing.
>>> <<<
I strangled 900 insurgents with my bare hands.
>>> <<<
That seems unlikely.
>>> <<<
That's what the first 600 said.
>>>
2006-11-12 * 
<<<
Before you energize my team with your proposal, let me introduce everyone.
>>> <<<
This is Wally. He'll show no reaction because he hopes apathy will kill our idea before it creates work.
>>> <<<
This is Alice. She'll leave halfway through your presentation to take a phone call.
>>> <<<
This is Asok. He'll be enthusiastic because he doesn't understand how the real world works.
>>> <<<
This is Dilbert. He'll tell you why your idea is impossible.
>>> <<<
This is Carol. She'll spend the entire meeting wondering if that's your real hair.
>>> <<<
And this is Ted. He gave his two-weeks' notice last week.
>>> <<<
And I like to keep my eyes closed the entire time because of my allergies. Go.
>>>
2006-11-11 * 
I need some data from an unreachable guy named Ed. What should I do? <<<
Just make up a bunch of data like everyone else does.
>>> <<<
Everyone else does that?
>>> <<<
Are you doubting my data?
>>>
2006-11-10 * 
<<<
Get the user data from Ed.
>>> <<<
That's impossible.
>>> <<<
Ed is an unreachable. He doesn't answer his phone or return messages. He's never in his cubicle and he doesn't read e-mail.
>>> <<<
Does he use the restroom?
>>> <<<
No, we think he modified his briefcase.
>>>
2006-11-09 * 
We've got a dead guy in cubicle D-32. <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> <<<
Do you have any idea how much paperwork it causes when someone dies in one of my cubicles?
>>> <<<
Ten more feet to the marketing department.
>>>
2006-11-08 * 
There's a rumor that you're dead. Is it true? <<<
He'll be missed.
>>>
2006-11-07 * 
I just saw Mort in his cubicle. I think he's...dead. <<<
I noticed that yesterday.
>>> <<<
And you didn't say anything???! Were you thinking he's just as dead tomorrow and someone else can do the paperwork?
>>> <<<
Wait. That's pretty good thinking...
>>> <<<
I was proud of it.
>>>
2006-11-06 * 
<<<
Hey Mort, are you coming to the...uh-oh.
>>> <<<
Are you dead? Hello! Hello!
>>> <<<
I'm going to let that problem work itself out.
>>>
2006-11-05 * 
<<<
Today I will teach you how to use your incompetence to achieve your goals.
>>> <<<
Step 1: Be incompetent. (Also known as 'the easy part.')" <<<
Step 2: Volunteer for the most difficult and important projects" <<<
Step 3: Convince your boss that an enemy within the company is slowing you down.
>>> <<<
Step 4: Insist that competent people be pulled off of other projects to help you.
>>> <<<
Step 5: Declare yourself the leader of the competent people" <<<
Step 6: Claim credit for the work of the competent people.
>>> <<<
Step 7: After you get promoted, fire the competent people to eliminate witnesses.
>>>
2006-11-04 * 
Wally in Marketing <<<
Wally, I want you to design our sales collateral.
>>> <<<
The trick is to compare our product with things that are even worse.
>>> <<<
'Prettier than a skunk sandwich and cooler than a hobo's mittens.'
>>>
2006-11-03 * 
Wally in Marketing <<<
According to my market research, ninety percent of your customers...
>>> <<<
...'fantasize about beating you to death with your stupid product.'" <<<
What about the other ten percent?
>>> <<<
They asked for your company address but didn't say why.
>>>
2006-11-02 * 
Wally in Marketing <<<
We'll need a name for this product.
>>> <<<
What do you call something that just occupies space and smells bad?
>>> <<<
What was your name again?
>>> <<<
I don't like where this is heading.
>>>
2006-11-01 * 
<<<
Wally, the marketing department requested your help.
>>> <<<
Me?
>>> <<<
Our new product is worthless, much like yourself. They figured you'd have some insight.
>>> <<<
All it does is occupy space and smell bad.
>>> <<<
Well, it's definitely a gift item.
>>>
2006-10-31 * 
It's another day of useless work and no accomplishment. <<<
Luckily I have a meaningful personal life.
>>> <<<
Ratbert broke the Xbox.
>>> <<<
GAAA!!! I HAVE NOTHING!
>>>
2006-10-30 * 
<<<
Wally, I can't work with the smell of popcorn in the air. It makes me insane!
>>> <<<
I use it to mask the odors coming from my body. Choose your poison.
>>> <<<
Refueling the Hindenburg?
>>> <<<
Why are people so mean?
>>>
2006-10-29 * 
<<<
Welcome to Dogbert's deeply discounted motivational speakers bureau.
>>> <<<
I need a slightly motivational speaker and I don't have much budget.
>>> <<<
I want to inspire my employees to work harder, without motivating them to seek better jobs.
>>> <<<
I recommend Robbie, the frightening hobo.
>>> <<<
Does he talk about his difficult journey from the dumpster to success?
>>> <<<
We're not sure. He mumbles.
>>> <<<
But no one has ever become an entrepreneur after hearing him speak.
>>> mumble mumble mumble <<<
Must...keep...job.

2006-10-28 * 
<<<
I'm debating on the Internet!
>>> <<<
Ha ha! I'm winning every argument by saying the same thing!
>>> <<<
What's that?
>>> <<<
'How would you like it if Hitler killed you?'" <<<
Hey, I debated you last night!
>>>
2006-10-27 * 
<<<
I want to debate with people on the Internet but I worry that I'm not smart enough.
>>> <<<
Maybe I'll just read what the smart people are saying.
>>> <<<
Okay, I'm in.
>>>
2006-10-26 * 
<<<
I worry that all of my wisdom is derived from bad analogies.
>>> <<<
Ratbert, sometimes a good wine has to age before it is perfect.
>>> <<<
So...I'll get smarter over time?
>>> <<<
To the extent that you are like a grape.
>>>
2006-10-25 * 
<<<
Alice, you did the work of three people this year and earned the highest raise in the department!
>>> <<<
3%" FOOM! <<<
What made you all cumulo-nimbus?
>>> <<<
3%
>>>
2006-10-24 * 
You've been acting strangely lately. Maybe you should cut down on the coffee. <<<
You have failed me. Feel the power of the force!
>>> erk! <<<
Bad dream?
>>> <<<
I wouldn't call it bad!
>>>
2006-10-23 * 
<<<
How can I tell if I'm drinking too much coffee?
>>> <<<
What would you do if I told you to quit?
>>> <<<
I'd jab you with a used needle.
>>> <<<
In that case, you're fine.
>>>

Catbert: <<<
Evil Director of Human Resources <<<
Our employee onboarding process will get you all mainstreamed in no time at all.
>>> <<<
This will be your cubicle, if we can find another place to store this junk.
>>> <<<
You'll get a phone and a computer if the budget ever gets approved.
>>> <<<
This is Alice. She will be your mentor.
>>> <<<
I don't have time to babysit! I'm buried in work!
>>> <<<
I do not like you. I...do...not...like you!!!
>>> <<<
Stand in the hallway and read these binders. If you learn anything, forget it, because knowledge isn't rewarded here.
>>> <<<
Try giving up hope. It turns the bad feeling into emptiness.
>>>
2006-10-21 * 
<<<
Thanks to coffee, I can levitate objects with my mind.
>>> <<<
Bring...the mouse...Bring the...mouse.
>>> <<<
It's not perfect yet.
>>> <<<
No problem. I appreciate the attention.
>>>
2006-10-20 * 
<<<
I wanted to discuss the...
>>> <<<
Whoa! Stop.
>>> <<<
Large doses of caffeine allow me to see the future. I already know what both of us will say.
>>> <<<
You're a freak.
>>> <<<
And then I say, 'And then I say...'
>>>
2006-10-19 * 
<<<
I finished all of my projects in one day.
>>> <<<
I also reconfigured the network, wrote seven white papers and applied for nine patents.
>>> <<<
Are you naked or am I developing X-ray vision?
>>> <<<
Give a thought to decaf.
>>>
2006-10-18 * 
<<<
Wally, how do you cope with the soul-crushing futility of this job?
>>> <<<
One day I realized that sadness is just another word for not enough coffee.
>>> <<<
What got into you?
>>>
2006-10-17 * 
<<<
Sometimes I feel as if my life is nothing but moving things from one place to another.
>>> <<<
I've decided to seek a deeper connection with others to cure my emptiness.
>>> <<<
Blah, blah, blah.
>>> <<<
Maybe I'm doing it wrong.
>>>
2006-10-16 * 
I stayed up all night working on Mindy's software because she threatened me if I didn't. <<<
Really? Threats make you work all night?
>>> <<<
Um...No?
>>> <<<
Work on this all night or I'll punch you.
>>>
2006-10-15 * 
<<<
My project has been infected by attractive people.
>>> <<<
As you know, attractive people are unproductive.
>>> <<<
The problem is compounded when you put several of them in the same room.
>>> <<<
They've already started to pair off.
>>> <<<
I've got four love triangles and six divorces.
>>> <<<
All of my status reports say, and I quote, 'Dude, I can't concentrate now.'" <<<
My plan is to replace each attractive person with something like this, or this.
>>> <<<
He thinks I'm productive.
>>>
2006-10-14 * 
<<<
I need you to drop whatever you're doing and work all night to make this change to your system.
>>> <<<
If you refuse to do my bidding, here's the rumor I will spread about you.
>>> <<<
Ha! I'll say I was only scratching an itch.
>>> <<<
Good luck with that.

Loud Howard <<<
THERE'S GOING TO BE A REORG!

I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL ANYONE!

Reorg?

DON'T MAKE ME SHUSH YOU!

2006-10-12 * 
Loud Howard returns <<<
Loud Howard, I'm planning a reorg and I need you to...
>>> <<<
A REORG?
>>> <<<
...keep it to yourself.
>>> <<<
CAN DO!
>>>
2006-10-11 * 
A disturbing number of you have requested the return of Loud Howard. <<<
Loud Howard is one-dimensional. There is nothing clever or insightful about him. He is simply loud.
>>> <<<
It is a mystery why anyone would want more of this guy.
>>> <<<
THEY LOVE ME!!!
>>>
2006-10-10 * 
My boss marked me with the plunger of blame. How can I get rid of it? <<<
Eventually your body will absorb the plunger of blame and turn it into the wrinkles of experience.
>>> <<<
And then you die.
>>> <<<
It's starting to itch!
>>>
2006-10-09 * 
Why did you attach the plunger of blame to me? <<<
The short answer is 'Because I can.'" <<<
What's the long answer?
>>> <<<
Because I-I-I-I ca-a-a-n.
>>>
2006-10-08 * 
<<<
A business magazine is sending a reporter to interview me.
>>> <<<
You?
>>> <<<
They want to learn my best management practices.
>>> <<<
That's a little like milking a squirrel because you need butter.
>>> <<<
I don't know what that meant, but I like the way it sounded.
>>> <<<
Describe your typical day.
>>> <<<
Well, let me tell you...
>>> <<<
Sometimes you milk the squirrel, and sometimes the squirrel milks you.
>>> <<<
'He is like a zen master. His words are peppered with squirrel-related wisdom.'" THE TIMES

I need to blame someone for the failure of Project Alpha. <<<
Use the plunger of blame. It's the latest technology for randomly distributing blame.
>>> <<<
Please tell me that someone is patting me on the back right now.
>>> BLAME
2006-10-06 * 
This t-shirt goes to Ted for his work on the alpha project. <<<
Your work was terrible. You're fired.
>>> IDIOT <<<
It was frightening.

Were you scared shirtless?
>>>
2006-10-05 * 
<<<
Hello, tech support, my computer is frozen.
>>> <<<
Try hanging up and slamming your hand in a drawer.
>>> <<<
How's work?
>>> <<<
My average call time is down and my job satisfaction is up.
>>>
2006-10-04 * 
<<<
I cannot decide if you are very wise or just a big stupid moron.
>>> <<<
Well, I'll tell you, little cowpoke, when the snake falls in love with the spaghetti, it's time to buy a new hat.
>>> <<<
You look more flustered than a barefoot squirrel at a tire store.
>>> <<<
Gaaa!!! They almost make sense!!
>>>
2006-10-03 * 
Did you start the benchmark tests? <<<
I'm all over that like a caterpillar on my Sunday pants.
>>> <<<
Does that mean...yes?
>>> <<<
Do birds eat beans to fly faster?
>>>
2006-10-02 * 
I come from a place where we have many colorful folk sayings! <<<
I'm happier than a wooden spoon at a spelling bee.
>>> <<<
Most of 'em don't mean nothin'.
>>>
2006-10-01 * 
<<<
According to my benchmark tests, our product is the worst one on the market.
>>> <<<
Maybe you can tweak the numbers.
>>> <<<
Fake them?
>>> <<<
Fake is such an ugly word.
>>> <<<
Just remember that your next raise depends on the sales of that product.
>>> <<<
And mistakes happen. A decimal place can be either here or there.
>>> <<<
All I'm asking is that you do the tests again...while drinking.
>>> <<<
I always wondered what job satisfaction felt like.

<<<
The new employee at work is hot, and she's getting special treatment. How can I get rid of her?
>>> <<<
Water finds its own level. She'll leave within a week.
>>> <<<
They say that most people meet their future spouses at work.
>>> erk!
>>>
2006-09-29 * 
That new employee is getting special treatment just because she's hot. It's unfair. <<<
She's hot? Where is her cubicle? Maybe I should bring her some coffee.
>>> <<<
Do you mind brewing an extra pot? I don't know how big her mug is.
>>>
2006-09-28 * 
<<<
Did you hire Ellen just because she's hot?
>>> <<<
Carol, hotness is an important skill. It's like a super power.
>>> <<<
From now on, how much are you charging us for printer cartridges?
>>> <<<
Fuh fuh free!
>>> ping
2006-09-27 * 
<<<
Alice, this is Ellen, your new natural enemy.
>>> <<<
You're highly skilled but mannish, whereas Ellen is unqualified and totally hot.

Now I have to decide who will come with me to the trade show in Hawaii and who will do the furniture inventory.
>>>
2006-09-26 * 
<<<
You're so attractive that I'm blind to your complete lack of qualifications.
>>> <<<
If I hire you, will you show up for work?
>>> <<<
Not often, you ignorant lump.
>>> <<<
Ha ha! It's cute the way you say it.
>>> <<<
Ha ha! I want your office.
>>>
2006-09-25 * 
I'm in trouble. Do we have a witness protection program for office snitches? <<<
I have the perfect hiding place for employees.

I'm gonna go eat some asparagus. Try to blend in.

Welcome to Dogbert's school of management.
>>> <<<
In today's lesson you will learn how to get your employees to do the impossible.
>>> <<<
I have issued to each of you one large rock for practice.
>>> <<<
Throw your rock in the air and demand that it stay there without falling.

Offer some non-monetary compensation to your rock to incent it.

If your rock refuses to comply, try yelling at it. Go.

2006-09-22 * 
<<<
So, Asok, what have you heard about Ted's project?
>>> <<<
He seems to be in over his head and he's blaming you for cutting the wrong budget.
>>> <<<
I hope this doesn't come back to bite me.
>>> <<<
Now now, Carol. I'm working my new snitch.
>>>
2006-09-21 * 
I got the latest numbers from Yvonne. <<<
How's Yvonne doing with the sextuplets now that her house burned down and she had shoulder surgery?
>>> <<<
It didn't come up.
>>>
2006-09-20 * 
Dogbert's Communication Seminar <<<
There's really no point in listening to other people.
>>> <<<
They're either going to be agreeing with you or saying stupid stuff.
>>> <<<
That should cut down on the questions.
>>>
2006-09-19 * 
<<<
Welcome to Dogbert's communication seminar.
>>> <<<
Today you will learn how to use your Blackberry while pretending to listen.
>>> <<<
Now repeat after me: Uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh. What was he thinking? Wow!
>>> click click click click
2006-09-18 * 
<<<
Alice, I'm sending you to a communication class.
>>> <<<
Because I've noticed that your words often say one thing while your body language says another.
>>> <<<
Frankly, it's creepy.
>>> <<<
Thank you. I appreciate the useful feedback.
>>>
2006-09-17 * 
<<<
We don't have enough chairs.
>>> <<<
Why do I always have to get the extra chair?
>>> <<<
I need to borrow your guest chair.
>>> <<<
No way.
>>> punch punch punch punch punch punch punch <<<
GAAAA!!!
>>> <<<
If you aren't willing to punch a coworker for a chair, you don't belong in this business.
>>>
2006-09-16 * 
My new strategy is to hire passionate people instead of smart ones. <<<
I curse the air conditioning system that blows such a cold wind!
>>> <<<
I can already feel our stock price going up.
>>>
2006-09-15 * 
<<<
I want employees who are passionate!
>>> <<<
GIVE ME THIS JOB OR SO HELP ME GOD, I WILL CUT OFF MY EAR!
>>> <<<
And I'm a people person.
>>>
2006-09-14 * 
Our sales guy vastly underbid a job. Now it's my project to install the system in a way that's profitable. <<<
Blame your customer for underspecifying the features then charge her through the nose for change orders.
>>> <<<
Three million dollars for an electrical plug?
>>> <<<
The base model uses a potato battery.
>>>
2006-09-13 * 
<<<
Per your suggestion, I asked our customer to voluntarily pay us more money to cover our bidding error.
>>> <<<
It might surprise you to learn that our customer doesn't like that idea.
>>> <<<
You probably made it sound like a bad thing.
>>>
2006-09-12 * 
<<<
Here's the problem: Our salesman, Lyin' John, sold you a system that we can't install without losing money.
>>> <<<
I propose that you pay us 40% more than we quoted you in the contract, and everyone wins.
>>> <<<
Her body language says she's thinking about it.
>>> CRACK!!!
>>>
2006-09-11 * 
You're in charge of installing the system that Lyin' John sold to our biggest customer. <<<
Lyin' John neglected to include the network and server in his sale. This is a financial sinkhole.
>>> <<<
You take the joy out of delegating.
>>>
2006-09-10 * 
<<<
How was your conference call?
>>> <<<
Very successful. Bill said he'd find a new supplier for the casing.
>>> <<<
Or it might have been Ron, Ted, or Bob. They all sound the same on the phone.
>>> <<<
I hope it wasn't Bill. He never follows through.
>>> <<<
Ron is too overworked, Ted is a liar and Bob's a moron.
>>> <<<
I'd say the call was a waste of time. It might even be a huge step backward.
>>> <<<
Success is the happy feeling you get between the time you do something and the time you tell a woman what you did.
>>>
2006-09-09 * 
What are you going to wear to Ted's wedding? <<<
Whatever comes up in the rotation.
>>> <<<
Then she shrieked some nonsense about spending six months shopping for shoes and started to punch me.
>>>
2006-09-08 * 
<<<
Steve, ask everyone in the department to sign this birthday card for my secretary.
>>> <<<
I've led men in combat and this is the sort of assignment you give me???
>>> <<<
Also, run down to the convenience store and buy her something fluffy or orange.
>>>
2006-09-07 * 
The enemy was less than fifty feet away and my only hope was to call for an air strike. <<<
That reminds me of the time I ran out of staples and had to use glue.
>>> <<<
And then a sniper spotted me.
>>> <<<
My glue was bad.
>>>
2006-09-06 * 
Is it difficult to transition from leading troops in combat life to the corporate life? <<<
WHERE ARE THE PRODUCT SPECS?!!
>>> <<<
The main difference is that it's harder to get good intel.
>>>
2006-09-05 * 
Wow! You're a decorated army combat veteran. <<<
That's the kind of toughness we need around here. You're hired!
>>> <<<
Then we'll have a pre-meeting to discuss leveraging our synergies to productize our content.
>>> <<<
GAAA!!!
>>>
2006-09-04 * 
<<<
If I buy this, how can I be sure you won't come out with a newer version next week?
>>> <<<
I give you my word as a job-hopping commission junky with a gambling problem.
>>> <<<
And even if we did have a newer version, it sure wouldn't fix any of the problems that this one has.
>>>
2006-09-03 * 
<<<
You exceeded all of your goals this year.
>>> <<<
But I can't give you much of a raise because you didn't have the appearance of success.
>>> <<<
Um...what?
>>> <<<
I have to justify to management all large raises, and they don't know that you exist.
>>> <<<
Who do they think accomplished all of my goals?
>>> <<<
I'll make it up to you next year.
>>> push <<<
Who was that?
>>> <<<
Some vendor.
>>>
2006-09-02 * 
Executive Compensation Review Board <<<
How much should we pay our CEO if he just shows up for work?
>>> <<<
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS!!!
>>> honk honk <<<
The clown makes a good argument.
>>> <<<
Aye!
>>>
2006-09-01 * 
We can kick a field goal in the ninth inning if we use a full-court press. <<<
Remember that you drive for show but you pick up the spare for dough.
>>> <<<
Have you been helping Alice with her sports metaphors?
>>> <<<
Perhaps.
>>>
2006-08-31 * 
<<<
The highlight of my workday is this ham sandwich.
>>> <<<
From now until quitting time, nothing else will be as rewarding.
>>> <<<
What do you do after work?
>>> <<<
I think about the sandwich.
>>>
2006-08-30 * 
<<<
I'm a technology left-behind.
>>> <<<
I don't know how to use a computer, cell phone, PDA, digital camera, iPod or TiVo.
>>> <<<
I'd recommend a life of crime but you aren't qualified.
>>>
2006-08-29 * 
<<<
I couldn't do any work this week because you gave Alice a bigger cubicle.
>>> <<<
Your favoritism had a corrosive effect on my morale, thus inhibiting my effectiveness.
>>> <<<
I'm optimistic that you'll do a better job of motivating me next week.
>>>
2006-08-28 * 
<<<
This is a picture of my cubicle. As you can see, it's slightly bigger than yours.
>>> <<<
That means I'm slightly more important than you.
>>> <<<
And yet you've worked here much longer.
>>> <<<
I GET IT!!!
>>>
2006-08-27 * 
<<<
There's one thing you should know...
>>> <<<
Whoa, whoa, Asok!
>>> <<<
What?
>>> <<<
Never tell him anything when he's distracted.
>>> <<<
He won't remember what you say. Later he'll blame you for not telling him.
>>> <<<
Also avoid telling him anything when he's angry, late, or busy.
>>> <<<
And don't tell him anything when he's tense or hungry.
>>> <<<
That doesn't leave much.
>>> <<<
I usually wait for a yawn.
>>> Yawn! <<<
My project is behind schedule because the vendor lied!!!
>>> <<<
The next one is all yours.
>>>
2006-08-26 * 
<<<
Alice, we're doing some construction and I have to move you to a slightly larger cubicle.
>>> <<<
Muwhahaha! I will use the power of my slightly larger cubicle to rule my coworkers with an iron fist!
>>> <<<
Get out of my way, you worthless microcuber!!
>>>
2006-08-25 * 
Your lawyer threatened to sue if I fire you for gross incompetence. So I decided to let you stay. <<<
And we've moved to an alphabetical system for awarding 'Employee of the Month'. This is your month.
>>> <<<
Stupid alphabet.
>>>
2006-08-24 * 
<<<
Wally has a laziness disability. If you fire him, I will sue you for violating labor laws.
>>> <<<
Furthermore, he is part endangered butterfly, on his mother's side.
>>> <<<
As we speak, he's looking for a workplace hazard to roll around in.
>>>
2006-08-23 * 
<<<
Wally, I've documented all of your disciplinary issues in your personnel file.
>>> <<<
You have violations for every letter of the alphabet except Z. For some reason you missed that one.
>>> Zzzzzz
2006-08-22 * 
<<<
Wally, we've been monitoring your Internet usage.
>>> <<<
You've been running a side business on eBay, selling our office supplies.
>>> <<<
Well, I guess empowerment turned out to be a bunch of blah, blah, blah.
>>>
2006-08-21 * 
Maybe I'll quit this job and sell things on eBay. <<<
What things?
>>> <<<
Items.
>>> <<<
People like items.
>>> <<<
Good plan.
>>>
2006-08-20 * 
<<<
Dilbert, meet your new coworker, Phil O'Dendron.
>>> <<<
Phil is a potted plant. He'll sit in your cubicle all day while you try to work.
>>> <<<
Does it talk?
>>> <<<
He has three stories that he repeats in an infinite loop.
>>> <<<
He'll begin with his reasons for why you should use his tax guy.
>>> <<<
Then he'll do a recap of recent reality TV shows.
>>> <<<
And last but not least, 'The way we did it at my last job.'" sob <<<
How do you plan to cut expenses?
>>> <<<
Well, performance bonuses are under control.
>>>
2006-08-19 * 
Today I will keep a positive attitude about life. <<<
I canceled your project so I can use the budget to remodel my office.
>>> <<<
Yay life!
>>>
2006-08-18 * 
<<<
This week I tried to work, but pop-up messages kept telling me to update my computer's software.
>>> <<<
I tried closing the pop-up windows, but they just kept coming back. There were too many of them!
>>> <<<
Did you upgrade your software?
>>> <<<
Great. I see whose side you're on.
>>>
2006-08-17 * 
Mordac, the preventer of information services<Br>"You have exceeded your e-mail storage limit!
>>> <<<
To increase your limit, you must get approval from your VP, the CIO, and one nonexistent person to be named later.
>>> <<<
I'm thinking either a yeti or a bikini model who is also an engineer.
>>> erk!
>>>
2006-08-16 * 
Drop the cell phone. I darn you to heck. blah blah blah <<<
Seriously. Don't make me use the spoon.
>>> blah blah blah <<<
I'm sorry it had to come to this.
>>>
2006-08-15 * 
<<<
By now, you've noticed that your jobs are hideous nightmares of frustration and underpayment.
>>> <<<
But what you don't know is that every other company is exactly the same.
>>> <<<
Reduce employee turnover...Check.
>>>
2006-08-14 * 
And that's why I recommend using this process. The Office Nemesis <<<
Have you done a cost-benefit analysis for every conceivable option?
>>> <<<
Safety violation! Safety violation!
>>>
2006-08-13 * 
<<<
When do I need to give the specs to the programmers?
>>> <<<
They don't need them.
>>> <<<
Why? Is it because they already know what to do?
>>> <<<
Yes, exactly. They know how to do that part.
>>> <<<
Well, now I have a difficult choice.
>>> <<<
I could call the programmers, prove you wrong, and suffer the consequences in a thousand subtle ways...
>>> <<<
Or I could do nothing and wait to get hosed for not providing the specs on time.
>>> <<<
Geez. You complain when I don't give you choices too.
>>>
2006-08-12 * 
<<<
Hi. I'm your new nemesis.
>>> <<<
The nemesis function used to be handled informally. Now it's a profession, kind of like project management.
>>> <<<
Stand by while I prepare my nemesis face and look for reasons to thwart you.
>>> sigh
2006-08-11 * 
<<<
You know what's funny? I'm getting paid to consult, but you're the smartest and most experienced person in the room.
>>> <<<
That must burn you like the heat of a thousand suns.
>>> <<<
That's my favorite sound!
>>> TWEEEET
2006-08-10 * 
The Mildly Retarded Consultant <<<
You'll have to drink from the firehose unless...
>>> <<<
...You drill down and check the dashboard to see why the bloatware bubbled up from the bake-off.
>>> <<<
Does that mean anything?
>>> <<<
Don't ping my cheese with your bandwidth.
>>>
2006-08-09 * 
<<<
Do you mind if I spout obvious generalities about information?
>>> <<<
If you have too much information, and it's not organized in any useful way, then it can't help you make decisions.
>>> <<<
Are you a consultant or mildly retarded?
>>> <<<
I wish I knew.
>>>
2006-08-08 * 
Customers are complaining that our price stickers leave white crud on the product. <<<
Our action plan is to include directions on how to lick it off.
>>> <<<
What about fingernails?
>>> <<<
Why would you lick fingernails?
>>>
2006-08-07 * 
<<<
Hey, I'm having a Schadenfreude party. Would you like to come?
>>> <<<
Sure! I don't know what Schadenfreude means, but it sounds fun.
>>> <<<
Too bad you're not invited, loser.
>>> <<<
Ouch.
>>> <<<
Best party ever.
>>>
2006-08-06 * 
<<<
I'm like the story of the auto mechanic.
>>> <<<
A woman has her car towed into the shop. The mechanic opens the hood and takes a look.
>>> <<<
After about ten seconds he takes a hammer and taps the engine. It starts right up.
>>> <<<
The mechanic says, 'That will be $100, please.'" Zzzzz <<<
The woman says, '$100??? All you did was tap the engine!'" <<<
The mechanic says, 'It's $90 for knowing where to tap and $10 for the tap.'" zzzzz TAP! <<<
20 years ago I wouldn't have known which one of you to tap.
>>>
2006-08-05 * 
<<<
In order to make an informed decision, you would need to know as much as I know.
>>> <<<
That's impossible. So instead, by mutual, implied agreement, I will feed you some lies that point you to the right decision.
>>> <<<
If we don't upgrade our servers, a herd of trolls will attack headquarters.
>>> <<<
No trolls!
>>>
2006-08-04 * 
Our CEO only has five minutes. Is that enough time for your PowerPoint presentation? <<<
No. An incomplete explanation of the situation will cause massively harmful strategic choices.
>>> <<<
What can we get for four-and-a-half minutes?
>>>
2006-08-03 * 
Did you have a chance to review my PowerPoint presentation? <<<
It's full of technical jargon and it's way too long.
>>> <<<
Did you even look at it?
>>> <<<
Why would I look at something like that?
>>>
2006-08-02 * 
<<<
My PowerPoint presentation is a vision of beauty and persuasion.
>>> <<<
It will make engineers weep, and profits will rain down from the sky.
>>> <<<
Jeepers. What kind of limping scrod is that?
>>> <<<
The good kind!
>>>
2006-08-01 * 
I hear you're a job hopper. <<<
I like to think I have high standards.
>>> <<<
Are you aware that all jobs require you to do things you'd rather not do? That's why they have to pay you.
>>> <<<
Perhaps your expectations are unrealistic.
>>> <<<
I quit! I'm going someplace where my coworkers will never waste my time!!!
>>>
2006-07-31 * 
<<<
You've had fifteen jobs in two months. How can I be sure you're not a job hopper?
>>> <<<
Maybe I change jobs a lot. And maybe I have gigantic rabbit ears. But does that make me a hopper?
>>> <<<
Okay, okay, you're hired.
>>> <<<
I am so sick of this place!
>>>
2006-07-30 * 
<<<
Did you fund the infrastructure project yet?
>>> <<<
Nope.
>>> <<<
I'm playing budget chicken with the director of operations.
>>> <<<
I'm hoping that his department needs the infrastructure more than we do.
>>> <<<
If I can bluff him into funding the project with his budget instead of mine, I win.
>>> <<<
He'll be reprimanded for exceeding his budget and I'll get a bonus for being under mine.
>>> <<<
I'll use the bonus to buy a summer cabin by the lake.
>>> <<<
Then I'll e-mail him pictures of my cabin and say, 'I hope you're enjoying your infrastructure as much as I'm enjoying my cabin!'" <<<
You've reached a new low.
>>> <<<
I've been thinking of firing you so I can get a fishing hat.
>>>
2006-07-29 * 
<<<
Alice, interview the guy in our conference room and see what he can do for us.
>>> <<<
I'm going to bonk your head on the table. If it sounds empty, you'll work in marketing.
>>> <<<
How did it go?
>>> <<<
I bonked too hard. We just got a new sales guy.
>>>
2006-07-28 * 
<<<
Alice, I've received some complaints that you have been bonking the heads of marketing people on tables.
>>> <<<
Where else should I bonk their heads? Tables are the best places!!!
>>> <<<
I don't think I'm getting through.
>>> <<<
The chair is way too soft!
>>>
2006-07-27 * 
There's a little thing I like to do before any meeting with a marketing guy. BONK! <<<
This way there's more congruence between the things you say and the way you look.
>>>
2006-07-26 * 
<<<
Wally, I came to ask you for the new design specs.
>>> <<<
But we both know you'll send me to someone who doesn't have them, and that person will refer me back to you.
>>> <<<
When I return, you will have escaped to your secret hiding place.
>>> <<<
Ted has the specs.
>>>
2006-07-25 * 
Is it more important to follow our documented process or to meet the deadline? <<<
I only ask because our deadline is arbitrary and our documented process was pulled out of someone's lower torso.
>>> <<<
Where's your artificial sense of urgency?
>>> <<<
Teamwork killed it.
>>>
2006-07-24 * 
<<<
Wally, are you sure you should eat that burrito? You do not have ISO 9004-3 certification.
>>> <<<
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
>>> <<<
It is entirely possible that I have been working here for too long.
>>>
2006-07-23 * 
<<<
What the...? How can you be relaxed with so much work to do?
>>> <<<
Your mistake is taking pride in how much work you can complete.
>>> <<<
You see, Alice, there's an infinite quantity of potential work.
>>> <<<
But it's only possible to do a finite amount.
>>> <<<
You have set yourself up for certain failure according to your own arbitrary standard.
>>> <<<
By way of contrast, I take pride in not taking pride in my work.
>>> <<<
I've already achieved my goal and it's not even lunch time yet.
>>> <<<
Don't you need a new goal for after lunch?
>>> <<<
I'm aiming for a distended stomach.
>>>
2006-07-22 * 
<<<
Do you know where Asok is?
>>> <<<
NO, I DO NOT!
>>> <<<
Do you think it's my job to know the location of all employees? Do you? Do you? Do you?
>>> <<<
Have you seen Alice?
>>> <<<
GAAA!!! MY HAIR IS ON FIRE!!
>>>
2006-07-21 * 
Today I had a choice of doing something important that no one would ever realize... <<<
...Or doing something useless that would look like an accomplishment.
>>> <<<
So I attended meetings until I could no longer appreciate the difference.
>>> <<<
Keep up the good work.
>>>
2006-07-20 * 
I find it rather demotivating that you never praise me for a job well done. <<<
You've never done a job well.
>>> <<<
That's because I'm demotivated.
>>> <<<
You have to go first.
>>> <<<
Wouldn't that make me the leader?
>>>
2006-07-19 * 
<<<
What type of meeting decision-making style will we be using today?
>>> <<<
Will it be authoritative, consultative, voting or consensus?
>>> <<<
Shut your coffee hole.
>>> <<<
Well played.
>>>
2006-07-18 * 
<<<
My pointy-haired boss couldn't make it, so he asked me to take notes.
>>> <<<
The entire reason for this meeting is to get his input. How the @#$% does taking notes help??
>>> <<<
The...entire...
>>>
2006-07-17 * 
Sorry I'm late. I was behind a herd of slow walkers. <<<
I couldn't jog around them at the wide spots because my coffee cup was too full.
>>> <<<
It's all part of my can't-do approach to life.
>>>
2006-07-16 * 
<<<
Wally, you've agreed to pull together all of the technical specifications by Thursday, right?
>>> <<<
Yes, I'll look into pulling that stuff together.
>>> <<<
I don't need you to 'look into it.' I need you to do it.
>>> <<<
I agree.
>>> <<<
Are you agreeing that I need it or agreeing to do it?
>>> <<<
You will have the list of who has the technical specifications by Thursday.
>>> <<<
I don't need the list of who has them. I need the specifications!
>>> <<<
I agree.
>>> <<<
GAAA!!! Forget it! I'll get them myself!
>>> <<<
Did you help Bob get what he needs?
>>> <<<
He'll have everything by Thursday.
>>>
2006-07-15 * 
<<<
You're in luck. I've lobbied the governments of several countries to attack your country and liberate you and your oil.
>>> <<<
We're already a democratic country! You're confusing us with North Elbonia!
>>> <<<
For a nitpicker, you sure dress poorly.
>>>
2006-07-14 * 
Dogbert the Lobbyist <<<
Congressman, I will give you this bag of money if you vote for tax breaks for my client.
>>> $ <<<
Try to be less obvious than the last time.
>>> <<<
YES! I VOTE YES!
>>> <<<
Smooth.
>>>
2006-07-13 * 
Dogbert the Lobbyist <<<
For a million dollars I can have the government include your industrial waste in the recommended food pyramid.
>>> <<<
For another million I'll have Congress authorize huge tax breaks for soulless, Blackberry-using weasels with coffee breath.
>>> <<<
I just want to hug you!
>>> <<<
That's another million.
>>>
2006-07-12 * 
<<<
If you hire me as your lobbyist I will convince Switzerland to attack Elbonia.
>>> $ <<<
When the war begins, your sales of Kevlar Lederhosen will skyrocket!
>>> <<<
It's not as bad as it sounds. Elbonians believe that if they die fighting a neutral country, their souls get candy.
>>>
2006-07-11 * 
<<<
I want you to write a business case for lobbying our government to attack Elbonia.
>>> <<<
In the risk analysis section, do you want me to assume that hell is real or imaginary?
>>> <<<
Real. But remember to discount the infinite future flows of agony to the present so it doesn't look so bad.
>>>
2006-07-10 * 
We discovered that the mud in Elbonia is caused by an abundance of oil and coal near the surface. <<<
Our country will be prosperous and happy forever unless we do something incredibly stupid.
>>> <<<
Are you building any weapons of mass destruction?
>>> <<<
Why? Is that a problem?
>>>
2006-07-09 * 
<<<
Dilbert, I have a little project for you to do in your spare time.
>>> <<<
What exactly is my 'spare time'?
>>> <<<
Well, for example, there's the time that normal people would use for dating.
>>> <<<
And since you're not dating, you can trim a few minutes from your hygiene schedule too.
>>> <<<
Then there's the time you spend daydreaming about a fulfilling life.
>>> <<<
That's exactly like stealing from the company.
>>> <<<
And your stupid questions - Those have to take at least an hour a day.
>>> <<<
Are my questions stupid?
>>> <<<
Not as bad as your answers.
>>>
2006-07-08 * 
<<<
Now that I know your resume was embellished, you need to talk to the VP of Human Resources.
>>> <<<
Are you going to fire me?
>>> <<<
Nah. I'll let you in on a little secret.
>>> <<<
I'm the ficus tree that used to be in the lobby.
>>>
2006-07-07 * 
<<<
I did a background check and discovered that you embellished your resume.
>>> <<<
For example, there's no college named 'The Einstein One.'" <<<
And I'm reasonably certain that 'Smartology' isn't a real major.
>>>
2006-07-06 * 
The Society of Insane Chicks <<<
I know he hates me because he likes to play racquetball.
>>> <<<
Maybe he just likes racquetball and wants to stay healthy.
>>> <<<
Leave now.
>>>
2006-07-05 * 
<<<
Welcome to the monthly meeting of insane chicks.
>>> <<<
Our speaker today is Betty, and her topic is 'All the people who are intentionally hurting us.'" <<<
The breakout session is titled 'How to turn your imaginary problems into real ones.'
>>>
2006-07-04 * 
I can no longer work with you because of what you said to someone about me. <<<
What did I allegedly say to whom?
>>> <<<
I can't tell you without violating the insane chick code of ethics.
>>>
2006-07-03 * 
Stinky Pete <<<
I was jogging to work and eating my onion sandwich when I spotted a sewage spill.
>>> <<<
So I did what anyone would do in that situation: I rolled around in it.
>>> <<<
A penny for your thoughts.
>>> <<<
I must insert my head into my buttocks so I can breathe.
>>>
2006-07-02 * 
<<<
Dilbert, this is Amber Dextrous, your new co-worker.
>>> <<<
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
>>> <<<
She's going for the hug.
>>> <<<
Oh heck, I'll just go with the flow and for once not be the socially awkward one.
>>> <<<
She wasn't going for the hug. She shakes with both hands.
>>> <<<
She's the perfect employee. She can do two things at the same time!
>>> <<<
Human resources surgically separated the two sides of her brain so she can multitask.
>>> Two days later <<<
I'm sorry to report that Amber drowned while trying to talk and drink water at the same time.
>>> <<<
Human resources would like to see you after this meeting.
>>>
2006-07-01 * 
<<<
Don't worry, Alice. Stinky Pete is here to work closely with you on that technical problem.
>>> <<<
I like to begin by releasing all of my negative energy.
>>> BRRAAAP! <<<
AAEEII!!
>>>
2006-06-30 * 
<<<
Our CEO got a $400,000,000 bonus this year. Can I get that too?
>>> <<<
Wally, he got that much because he's a million times more important than you.
>>> <<<
Fair enough. Can I have the $400 that you say I'm worth?
>>>
2006-06-29 * 
Exit Interview <<<
And what is your reason for leaving?
>>> <<<
To be honest, I was spending way too much time thinking about creative ways to kill you.
>>> <<<
Have you cleared out your desk?
>>> <<<
Why don't you go check.
>>>
2006-06-28 * 
<<<
Oprah invited me to appear on her show to talk about my book, but I'm too busy. Can you pretend you're me?
>>> <<<
Gosh...Normally I would never do something like that, but it's probably my only chance of being on Oprah. Thank you.
>>> <<<
Ow! Ow! Ow!
>>> <<<
Oprah is a surprisingly good puncher.
>>>
2006-06-27 * 
I've written a future best-selling book. <<<
It's part fake autobiography and part plagiarism.
>>> Moby Dog Publisher Pitch <<<
You were a large white whale? Wow!
>>> <<<
Until I married Mary Magdalene.
>>>
2006-06-26 * 
Can you bring me up to speed before we go to the meeting? <<<
No. You can't fit two gallons in a thimble no matter how fast you pour.
>>> <<<
Wait a minute...Which one of us is the thimble?
>>>
2006-06-25 * 
<<<
Welcome to Dogbert's accelerated sales training course.
>>> <<<
Today you will learn how a person can simultaneously drink and golf.
>>> <<<
What will we learn tomorrow?
>>> <<<
Tomorrow? What part of 'accelerated' is confusing you?
>>> <<<
As you know, the hard part about drinking and golfing is that they both require your hands.
>>> <<<
That's why I invented the sportsman's beer muzzle.
>>> <<<
Give this to your client and the sale will practically make itself.
>>> <<<
Ooh!
>>> <<<
Ooh!
>>> <<<
Ooh!
>>> <<<
This ish the besht day of my life!
>>> <<<
I'll put you down for ten pallets of mouse pads.
>>>
2006-06-24 * 
<<<
I'm Betty the Bulldozer, and I always get what I want!
>>> <<<
Drop everything and start doing my bidding now, intern!
>>> <<<
This was just a test. Wait here until I need something.
>>> shiver
2006-06-23 * 
<<<
Gaaa! You put your gum on this recyclable waste material!!!
>>> <<<
How do you like it in your hair? Huh? Not so funny now is it, tree-killer!
>>> <<<
The worst part is that I envy him for being passionate about his job.
>>>
2006-06-22 * 
<<<
Before I begin my day, I'd like to see which of my thirty projects you still remember assigning to me.
>>> <<<
...And thirty: Rename the projects so it's not so easy to spot our over-spending.
>>> <<<
None of those ring a bell, but they all seem critical now.
>>> <<<
Ouch.
>>>
2006-06-21 * 
<<<
You need to work this weekend.
>>> <<<
There's no work to do. I'm waiting for input.
>>> <<<
That doesn't matter. Strong leaders make their people work on weekends.
>>> <<<
Then he asked me what the clueless leaders do, as if I would know that.
>>>
2006-06-20 * 
Smokin' Jim <<<
I've got a nicotine addiction, a tiny bladder, and attention deficit disorder.
>>> <<<
So talk fast because I can't focus for more than ten seconds.
>>> <<<
Gaa! I have to give that warning faster!!!!
>>>
2006-06-19 * 
Smokin' Jim <<<
I'll see if the errors are coming from the compiler or...uh-oh.
>>> <<<
Code Red! I'm losing him! Bring the containment suit, stat!
>>> click click click <<<
He'll be highly productive for another hour. Then we'll notify the widow.
>>>
2006-06-18 * 
<<<
Your project came in 10% over budget.
>>> <<<
Actually, it came in at exactly what I estimated.
>>> <<<
You cut my budget by 10% because you wanted to feel like a leader.
>>> <<<
I assume you'll give me a huge raise to reward my excellent estimating ability.
>>> <<<
Why can't you be like Wally? His project budget was $10,000,000 and he only spent $147.
>>> <<<
If you're so smart, explain that!
>>> <<<
That's hard to explain without using the phrase 'You gullible toad.'" <<<
I'm next. What kind of mood is he in?
>>> <<<
Not so good.
>>>
2006-06-17 * 
I think what we should do is... <<<
Whoa!
>>> <<<
Give me a minute to install my management listening catheter.
>>> <<<
Tell me about your excellent suggestion.
>>>
2006-06-16 * 
Let's use our process to figure out why Project Wolverine failed. <<<
There was only one reason: Management discourages employees from voicing opinions.
>>> <<<

Satan's Vendor <<<
Ha ha ha! Now that you've implemented our product, you are at our mercy.
>>> <<<
We shall raise the price of upgrades and delay promised patches. There is nothing you can do about it. Nothing!
>>> <<<
Wow. You're fast with those scissors.
>>> <<<
I scrap.
>>>
2006-06-14 * 
Satan's Vendor <<<
We'll send your engineers to our free training course.

The training is held on our own island retreat.

I'm going where?
>>> <<<
Fecalruba.

2006-06-13 * 
Satan's Vendor <<<
You'll have many benefits after our technology is irrevocably implemented in your network.
>>> <<<
For example, when one of our products stops working, we'll blame another vendor within 24 hours.
>>> <<<
Do you have free t-shirts?

Yes. They're made of the finest allergens.

<<<
Would you like to buy a candy bar for my daughter's school fundraiser?
>>> <<<
No thanks. I'm not hungry.
>>> <<<
That's not really the point.
>>> <<<
Why would I buy an overpriced candy bar if I didn't plan on eating it right away?
>>> <<<
You'd do it because your coworker asked you to.
>>> <<<
That's a reason?
>>> <<<
Yes, it is.
>>> <<<
In that case, I'll take one.
>>> Five minutes later <<<
Hey, coworker, would you like to buy a half-eaten candy bar?

2006-06-10 * 
Patty the Amplifier and Distorter <<<
Tell the project team that we're pushing back the schedule by a week.
>>> <<<
I can't tell you the reason because you would amplify and distort it.
>>> <<<
THE SCHEDULE IS CHANGING BECAUSE DILBERT HATES WOMEN!!!
>>>
2006-06-09 * 
Patty the Amplifier and Distorter <<<
We got a proposal from a new vendor today.
>>> <<<
DILBERT LOVES THE NEW VENDOR HE THINKS THAT ANYONE WHO DISAGREES IS AN IDIOT!
>>> <<<
That's not what...
>>> <<<
HE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH THE SALES REP!
>>>
2006-06-08 * 
<<<
If you don't give us a urine sample to test, I have to fire you.
>>> <<<
How about a hair sample to test instead?
>>> <<<
How do I know it's your hair?
>>> <<<
You can take the sample yourself.
>>> <<<
Add this to the list of things you shouldn't trust human resources to do.
>>>
2006-06-07 * 
<<<
Human resources tells me that you refused to take the random drug test.
>>> <<<
I didn't refuse. I literally can't do it because I have a shy bladder. It's a medical condition that 7% of men have.
>>> <<<
I hope you will understand.
>>> <<<
It's a side effect of the nose candy, right?
>>>
2006-06-06 * 
Catbert: <<<
Evil Director of Human Resources <<<
What?
>>> <<<
You've been randomly selected for a drug test.
>>> <<<
I have a shy bladder. I can't produce under pressure!!!
>>> <<<
Do it now or be fired.
>>> <<<
Thanks for understanding.
>>> <<<
DO IT! DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!

Dogbert's Tech Support <<<
Yes, we do claim that our software is idiot-proof.
>>> <<<
If you boght it, that's proof you're an idiot.

High five!

2006-06-04 * 
<<<
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
>>> <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> <<<
It's 2 o'clock and my brain has shut down for the afternoon.
>>> <<<
Blah, blah, blah, blah...
>>> <<<
I have no idea what he's talking about.
>>> <<<
This calls for some generic leadership.
>>> <<<
Do a cost-benefit analysis, get buy-in from all the key stakeholders, and track the critical metrics.
>>> <<<
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a conference call.
>>> push <<<
How did anyone manage before there were fake conference calls?
>>>
2006-06-03 * 
The product review board approved your business case for the government mandate. <<<
Diversity is very important to this company.
>>> <<<
What do you think 'government mandate' means?
>>> <<<
I've seen the way the mailman looks at me.
>>>
2006-06-02 * 
We need to add a $3 component to our product to comply with federal law. <<<
The product review committee will need a cost-benefit study before we decide.
>>> <<<
And you know it's accurate because I used math!
>>> Duh 100
2006-06-01 * 
<<<
I got a job at the Indian company where you outsourced my job.
>>> <<<
Then I arranged to work from home, which, as you know, is my old cubicle.
>>> <<<
Fine. Here's your assignment.
>>> <<<
E-mail it to me. My day starts in 10 hours.
>>>
2006-05-31 * 
<<<
Wally, my job has been outsourced to India.
>>> <<<
That's interesting because you came here from India.
>>> <<<
Did you already think of that?
>>> <<<
YES!
>>>
2006-05-30 * 
<<<
Asok, I'm outsourcing your job to India.
>>> <<<
What?
>>> <<<
I moved here from India to take this job! Now I'll have to go back!
>>> <<<
Tell Sandeep I need some photocopies.
>>>
2006-05-29 * 
<<<
Dilbert, meet your new coworker, Mister Serdecisions.
>>> <<<
Call me Lou.
>>> <<<
Can you cover for me tomorrow while I put shelf paper in my kitchen cabinets?
>>> <<<
Tomorrow is our project kickoff meeting.
>>> <<<
Good lord, man! I can't put dishes on wood?
>>>
2006-05-28 * 
<<<
Here's a game card that gives you a chance to win groceries.
>>> <<<
No thanks. Just take a penny off my bill and we'll call it even.
>>> <<<
Um...I can't do that.
>>> <<<
Why not? Isn't that game card worth a penny?
>>> <<<
We don't have a procedure.
>>> <<<
How's that my problem?
>>> <<<
Look, maybe you could eat something that's worth a penny and I'll look the other way.
>>> <<<
How about a grape? I like grapes.
>>> <<<
It would have to be one that's been on the floor.
>>> <<<
It tasted like victory.
>>>
2006-05-27 * 
<<<
Asok, you've done a good job this quarter so I'm going to toss a little non-monetary compensation your way.
>>> <<<
Tell me some boring story about your life and I'll pretend to enjoy it.
>>> <<<
And the story should involve pirates. Go.
>>>
2006-05-26 * 
<<<
Alice, our budget is tight so I've been asked to reward you with non-monetary compensation.
>>> <<<
Do you know Ken in marketing? You can punch him as hard as you want.
>>> <<<
Does Ken know about this?
>>> <<<
People love surprises.
>>>
2006-05-25 * 
<<<
Good news, Carol: The new office supply catalog is here!
>>> <<<
If you leaf through it and imagine that you can order things, you'll get a mild shopper's high.
>>> OFFICE <<<
Now...I know how much you hate the phrase 'in lieu of a raise'...
>>>
2006-05-24 * 
<<<
If your lawyers are going to claim all of my patents, I demand my old job back.
>>> <<<
Okay.
>>> <<<
Really?
>>> <<<
Yay.
>>>
2006-05-23 * 
<<<
When you worked here, you signed a non-compete agreement.
>>> <<<
It clearly states that you are not allowed to earn money, sleep indoors, procreate or seek medical care.
>>> <<<
Section 5B describes what you must now do with this ceremonial dagger.
>>>
2006-05-22 * 
You thought up your search engine idea before we fired you. That means my company owns it. <<<
That's why I used the lawyerpult to hurl our attorney onto you.
>>> <<<
Now I'm using the holograph device you invented. That thing is making us billions.
>>> <<<
GAAA!!!
>>>
2006-05-21 * 
<<<
The first item of business is...
>>> clickety clickety clickety clickety clickety clickety <<<
What's that sound?
>>> clickety clickety clickety clickety <<<
Airplane.
>>> <<<
Scooter.
>>> <<<
Locusts.
>>> <<<
Why does it stop when you talk?
>>> <<<
It landed.
>>> <<<
It parked.
>>> <<<
They're napping.
>>> <<<
Okay...Anyway, I wanted to thank you all for your attendance.
>>> clickety clickety clickety clickety <<<
I know you were concerned that my meetings were using up all of the time you had for doing work.
>>> clickety clickety clickety clickety clickety <<<
Productivity is up, but apparently we have locusts.
>>>
2006-05-20 * 
I got funding to start my own search engine company! Nothing can stop me now! Meanwhile <<<
Fire the lawyerpult.

I'd like to talk to you about your patent.

Vijay, the world's most desperate venture capitalist <<<
I started in my garage...
>>> <<<
Take my money!!!
>>> <<<
Don't you want to hear the rest?
>>> <<<
I don't see how it could get any better.
>>> <<<
I have a product.
>>> <<<
I need a forklift and massage oil now!!!
>>>
2006-05-18 * 
My space defense shield detects an incoming threat. I am launching intercept rockets. <<<
Apparently the boys at Google used a death ray to blast the international space station out of orbit and toward our house.
>>> <<<
Why do you have a space defense shield?
>>> <<<
Doesn't that seem like a stupid question now?
>>>
2006-05-17 * 
Google Headquarters <<<
Isn't it a little bit evil to kill Dilbert with our death ray?
>>> <<<
Good point...What if I just blast the space station out of orbit and make it land on his house?
>>> <<<
I'll bet you ten billion dollars you can't.
>>> <<<
And the lower has to introduce himself as 'the dumb one.'
>>>
2006-05-16 * 
<<<
Aren't you afraid that Google will try to squash you for inventing a better search engine?
>>> <<<
Their company motto is 'Don't Be Evil.' It's not as if they have a death ray or something.
>>> Google Headquarters <<<
Now look in the big hole, Eric.
>>>
2006-05-15 * 
I need your help to patent my search engine algorithm. <<<
Then I will become a billionaire and have attractive girlfriends.
>>> <<<
Hold on...I have an emerging primate...and he's got wings!
>>> Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
>>>
2006-05-14 * 
<<<
I've had it with this place! I quit!
>>> <<<
No!!!!
>>> <<<
We can't finish the project on time if you leave.
>>> <<<
I'll give you a 20% raise if you stay.
>>> <<<
Really? Okay. I'll stay.
>>> <<<
Huh.
>>> <<<
Hey, everyone, disloyalty is being rewarded!
>>> <<<
I'll probably get another raise for this.
>>>
2006-05-13 * 
I invented a search engine that's also a singles matching service. <<<
It automatically matches singles who search for the same keywords.
>>> <<<
And then it threatens to e-mail those keywords to their mothers if they don't agree to date.
>>> <<<
I have taught you well.
>>>
2006-05-12 * 
I'm going to start a high tech company in the garage. <<<
Some of the most successful companies started in garages. It must help somehow.
>>> <<<
I wonder if those other guys had homeowner rules about not parking in the driveway.
>>>
2006-05-11 * 
Career Counselor <<<
And why did you leave your last job?
>>> <<<
My dog was tired of hearing me whine about my job, so he became a billionaire and bought my company and fired me.
>>> <<<
I don't have a checkbox for that so I'll just write in 'Loser.'
>>>
2006-05-10 * 
<<<
With your billions of dollars, I don't understand why you live here?
>>> <<<
I don't. I live in an underground city of interconnected palaces. The elevator is in your linen closet.
>>> <<<
We billionaires only come topside to take your coffee and your women.
>>> <<<
Hola, Dogbert.
>>> <<<
Oh.
>>>
2006-05-09 * 
You said I'd never find an online date because I'm unemployed. But you were wrong! <<<
Have you seen her picture?
>>> <<<
Yes! She looks hot.
>>> <<<
Do you have 'Photoshop' software?
>>> <<<
Maybe.
>>>
2006-05-08 * 
<<<
Now that I'm unemployed, I don't feel like a valuable member of society.
>>> <<<
Consider this bag of garbage. It too is unemployed and yet it is worthy of love.
>>> <<<
I don't love it.
>>> <<<
That's too bad because no one else will date you now.
>>>
2006-05-07 * 
<<<
And then we'll send the draft for review...
>>> BZZZZZT! <<<
Greetings. I am Wally from the year 2040.
>>> <<<
In the future, time travel will be possible but highly unethical.
>>> <<<
But it's only unethical if you make the mistake of changing anything from the past.
>>> <<<
I was out of coffee so I came here to get a fresh cup. Ah, here we go.
>>> <<<
I have to run. Make sure nothing changes because of my visit or it will kill everyone in the future.
>>> <<<
Let me be the first to say that this feels awkward.

2006-05-06 * 
Job Interview <<<
We need someone who can solve the biggest engineering problem we have ever encountered.

Just distribute the power supply across both functions and double the fan size.

Thanks. If I need anything else, I'll interview you again.

2006-05-05 * 
Unemployed <<<
No problem. I'll just go online and find a great job.
>>> <<<
Let's see...This one looks good. 'No experience needed...
>>> <<<
...Must be willing to relocate, then be put into a huge blender and packed as a condiment.'
>>>
2006-05-04 * 
<<<
You're always complaining about the management of your company so I decided to do something about it.
>>> <<<
I used my billions to buy your company!
>>> <<<
You're going to fix management?
>>> <<<
No, I just wanted to stop all the whining. You're fired.
>>>
2006-05-03 * 
CHIPS <<<
Hello Dogbert. I am here to persuade you to give your billions to third world countries.
>>> <<<
If guilt does not work, I am prepared to wrestle you for it.
>>> <<<
How's your decoy working out?
>>> <<<
He's got Bono in a headlock.
>>>
2006-05-02 * 
<<<
And that's how I made a billion dollars in shady real estate deals.
>>> <<<
The moral of the story is that crime doesn't pay...
>>> <<<
Directly; it goes through escrow.
>>> <<<
Dogbert, don't ruin the rat.
>>>
2006-05-01 * 
<<<
I worked all year on a project that got canceled today because we got a new vice president who didn't like it.
>>> <<<
I made a billion dollars by convincing suckers that a garbage barge was oceanfront real estate.
>>> <<<
Would you lend me some money so I can open my own business.
>>> <<<
No, but I know some people on a barge who would.
>>>
2006-04-30 * 
<<<
Wally, I have to let you go...
>>> <<<
Well, this was bound to happen.
>>> <<<
I guess someone told you that I e-mailed our CEO and said you think his daughter looks like a chimp.
>>> <<<
Or is it because I built a guest house from stolen office supplies?
>>> <<<
Maybe it's because you found out that I've been taking a dollar out of your desk every day for seven years.
>>> <<<
Actually, I was trying to say I have to let you go to a training class.
>>> <<<
Is it someplace nice?
>>>
2006-04-29 * 
<<<
Welcome to 'Dogbert's Barge City', your floating paradise.

Please leave your cell phones behind, as well as anything else that might let you signal for help.

There's more garbage in paradise than you'd think.

2006-04-28 * 
<<<
'Dogbert's Barge City' is the affordable way to live by the ocean.

Your brochure says you will rule with an iron paw and throw dissidents to the sharks.

Well, I'm in. But this one is getting all dissident on you.

2006-04-27 * 
Vijay, the world's most desperate venture capitalist <<<
I need a hundred billion to build an ocean city on barges.
>>> <<<
Take my money!!! Take it, take it, take it!
>>> <<<
Do I get stock or something?
>>> <<<
How about an insincere wag?
>>> Insincere wag! $ $
2006-04-26 * 
<<<
I plan to build my own country on the ocean using barges.
>>> <<<
I shall rule with an iron paw, punishing citizens for no reason other than my own entertainment. Buwhaha!!!

I'm hoping people will put up with it because their homes are near the ocean.
>>>
2006-04-25 * 
<<<
Sorry I'm late. The car rental place was out of cars.
>>> <<<
All they had left was this glove from their lost-and-found. So I put it on and ran here.
>>> <<<
At least I got something.
>>> <<<
Hey, that's my glove!
>>>
2006-04-24 * 
MAPS <<<
I reserved a mid-sized car.
>>> <<<
Let's see what's left.
>>> <<<
We don't have any cars left. But I can let you borrow a glove from the lost-and-found bin.
>>> <<<
What good is one glove?
>>> <<<
You wouldn't ask that if you had a frozen hand.
>>>
2006-04-23 * 
Your management performance has been abysmal. I'm afraid I have to minimize you. <<<
Minimize? Is that like downsize?
>>> <<<
Downsizing is only for non-managers.
>>> <<<
Abysmal managers get minimized. Follow me.
>>> <<<
Your new office is the size of a refrigerator crisper.
>>> <<<
You will have no direct reports and your job title will be 'Director of Unnecessary and Special Projects.'" <<<
Can I ever be maximized?
>>> <<<
Maybe if some other manager jumps off the roof.
>>> <<<
You're right - the view up here is spectacular!
>>>
2006-04-22 * 
Topper <<<
I had to carry over three weeks of vacation.
>>> <<<
That's nothing!
>>> <<<
I carried over so much time that they had to create a new month and name it after me!
>>> <<<
Shut your pie hole!
>>> <<<
It looks as if someone is having a bad topperuary.
>>>
2006-04-21 * 
I just saw a study that says the dull appearance of my cubicle is probably inhibiting the growth of neurons in my brain! <<<
Try sitting there for a few hours and then tell me if you feel any different.
>>> <<<
Now I can't remember what I was complaining about.
>>>
2006-04-20 * 
Your engineers think my project plan won't work. <<<
I'll assign Wally to your project. He's a perfect fit.
>>> <<<
Because he's a problem solver?
>>> <<<
Because he won't work either.
>>>
2006-04-19 * 
Dilbert and Wally refuse to support my project plan. Will you take a look at it? <<<
GAAA!!! The stupidity is leaping off the page and burrowing into my brain!!!
>>> <<<
Does anyone around here known how to say a simple 'This won't work'?
>>> gurgle
2006-04-18 * 
<<<
Dilbert says my plan won't work. I need a second opinion.
>>> <<<
Hypothetically, if I say your plan is terrific, would I end up being the engineer who has to implement it?
>>> <<<
Maybe.
>>> <<<
Your plan reeks of infeasibility.
>>>
2006-04-17 * 
I need your honest opinion about my project plan. Don't hold back. <<<
Your plan looks like it was written by a drunken lemur as a practical joke on other drunken lemurs.
>>> <<<
Today I learned that people don't like drunken lemur analogies.
>>>
2006-04-16 * 
<<<
My chair is broken. May I use your extra one?
>>> <<<
I don't have an extra chair.
>>> <<<
Sure you do. It's right there.
>>> <<<
That's not an extra chair. It's my guest chair.
>>> <<<
Okay, whatever. The point is that the base broke off of my chair.
>>> <<<
I can't sit on a chair that has no wheel base. It's unstable.
>>> <<<
Stop being a baby. Just turn your chair upside-down and it will be totally stable.
>>> <<<
When did your chair break?
>>> <<<
Last spring. You get used to it.

2006-04-15 * 
The Contractor <<<
My dream is to one day become a regular employee.
>>> <<<
My dream is to eat candy and poop emeralds.
>>> <<<
The difference is that I'm halfway successful.
>>>
2006-04-14 * 
The Contractor <<<
No pressure, but do you have any idea how easy it would be to get rid of you?
>>> <<<
There isn't even any paperwork. I just point my finger and you're history.
>>> <<<
Here comes the firing finger. Oooh...Watch out!
>>>
2006-04-13 * 
I'll bring you on as a contract employee. <<<
Then I'll keep you motivated by dangling the carrot of becoming a regular employee.

Your first mistake was assuming that he understands metaphors.

DilMom <<<
Your security software is out of date...
>>> <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> <<<
Would you like to spend the rest of your natural life trying to figure out how to upgrade it?
>>> <<<
Erk!
>>> <<<
Or would you prefer to let hackers steal your identity, drain your bank accounts and destroy your hard drive?
>>> <<<
I need more choices!
>>>
2006-04-11 * 
I need to have one more direct report and it will trigger an automatic promotion for me. <<<
Your job is to be that employee.
>>> <<<
How's it feel to be part of the team?
>>> <<<
Not as special as I'd hoped.
>>>
2006-04-10 * 
<<<
Alice, I need you to be less productive.
>>> <<<
I'll get an automatic promotion if I can justify hiring one more direct report.
>>> <<<
If I'm going to work like an idiot, I might as well look like one.
>>>
2006-04-09 * 
<<<
I need you to accompany me on an important sales call.
>>> <<<
Me?
>>> <<<
You're my secret weapon.
>>> <<<
Well, okay.
>>> <<<
What's your name?
>>> <<<
I'm Ed, from sales.
>>> <<<
Only two companies make this type of product. The prices are identical.
>>> <<<
The difference is that our engineering staff brings genius and innovation to everything it touches.
>>> <<<
Whereas my competitor employs this loser.
>>> <<<
Really? I wondered why you didn't look familiar.
>>> <<<
Sold!
>>> <<<
You helped make a sale?
>>> <<<
Why does everyone act all surprised?
>>>
2006-04-08 * 
I'm back from my three-week vacation. <<<
I didn't know you were gone.
>>> <<<
Um...I meant I'm leaving tomorrow for my three-week vacation.
>>> <<<
How was your vacation?
>>> <<<
Twice as good as I expected!
>>>
2006-04-07 * 
<<<
You said it was a team-building exercise and you left me in the middle of the desert to die!
>>> <<<
Shake it off.
>>> <<<
You wouldn't think that would work, but it does!
>>>
2006-04-06 * 
I must use the survival methods I learned at the Indian Institute of Technology. <<<
Step one: Pretend to be a wounded rodent.
>>> <<<
Now look for the highway and tickle the hawk with its own feather.
>>>
2006-04-05 * 
<<<
I listened to your concerns about Ted's work, so I tricked him into being left in the middle of the desert.
>>> <<<
He thinks it's a team-building exercise. Hee hee!
>>> <<<
We wanted you to transfer him, not kill him.
>>> <<<
Really? This is awkward.
>>> <<<
And this is Ted. Where's Asok?
>>>
2006-04-04 * 
<<<
Ted, I'm sending you on a team-building exercise.
>>> <<<
A security guard will drive you to the middle of the desert and leave you there!
>>> <<<
And then the team will rescue me?
>>> <<<
Sure.

Company policy says that space heaters are not allowed in cubicles.

My heater doesn't heat space. It heats the air in my cubicle. That's okay, right?

Why would anyone heat 'space'?

It keeps Uranus warm.

Interview this candidate and make sure he isn't too old. <<<
It's illegal to ask his age.
>>> <<<
Just stall until you see the telltale signs of E.E.H.G.
>>> <<<
E.E.H.G.?
>>> <<<
Explosive ear hair growth.
>>> <<<
Hmm. No wrinkles. But maybe he uses moisturizers and stays out of the sun.

Wait...wait...

Can't...hold out any...longer.

Ha!

Your mp3 player is large and scary, but I can fix that.

All it needs is a set of Angelina Jolie lips and everyone will love it.
>>> Six Months Later <<<
We must never speak of this.
>>>
2006-03-31 * 
The Marketing Guru <<<
Consumers will buy our tractor-sized mp3 players if we offer something free with each one.
>>> <<<
So we'll offer a free iPod with each sale, and free towing to the landfill for our mp3 player.
>>> <<<
The rest is just pricing.
>>>
2006-03-30 * 
<<<
We need to hire the best marketing expert we can find.
>>> <<<
Your resume says you've won the Nobel Prize in marketing, and five Olympic gold medals in the marketing biathlon.
>>> <<<
What's a marketing biathlon?
>>> <<<
You ski up to people who won't buy your crap and you shoot them.
>>>
2006-03-29 * 
We ship our new mp3 player in two days. How's the Elbonian factory coming along? <<<
The prototype is the size of a small tractor and it will only play Elbonian polkas.
>>> <<<
I'll budget a little extra for marketing.
>>> <<<
It's made of asbestos.
>>>
2006-03-28 * 
<<<
After seeing the Elbonian mp3 player prototype I scheduled a conference call.
>>> <<<
Because of the time difference, the call was at 3 AM. I was groggy and they barely speak any English, but I think we got everything worked out.
>>> <<<
He was right. It does look better with the speakers.
>>>
2006-03-27 * 
<<<
Here's our prototype from the Elbonian factory.
>>> <<<
Well, I'm no expert, but this is obviously a good one of these.
>>> <<<
It's an mp3 player.
>>> <<<
We used to call them plumber's helpers!
>>>
2006-03-26 * 
<<<
What's that thing doing here?
>>> <<<
This is my daughter, Traylor.
>>> <<<
I brought her to the office so she can learn about working in a corporate environment.
>>> <<<
Okay, whatever. I have a new project for you.
>>> <<<
Some idiot cut his finger. Now we have to do a safety awareness campaign.
>>> <<<
Put on this dog costume. You're the mascot for our 'Spot' the safety hazard campaign.

Whenever anyone walks by, you say, 'Woof woof, don't use scissors.'" <<<
Can I get a tattoo?
>>> <<<
Sure.
>>>
2006-03-25 * 
My Elbonian factory can manufacture your product for pennies. <<<
Is there any downside?
>>> <<<
Minor translation issues.
>>> <<<
They either said 'plastic' or 'the spleen of a pig-footed bandicoot.'" <<<
We don't have any plastic.
>>> SPLEENS
2006-03-24 * 
My idea is to drape a huge tarp over the hideous sculpture in the courtyard. <<<
My message will be that art is as much about the negative space as the positive.
>>> <<<
Plus it's not really art unless someone is winning.
>>>
2006-03-23 * 
Famous artist Dogberto will tell us his plans for our lobby. <<<
I plan to buy a drop cloth at Home Depot and drape it over the security desk.
>>> <<<
Won't that be hard on the guard?
>>> <<<
Not until I douse it with gas and light it.
>>>
2006-03-22 * 
<<<
Carol, I need some three-ring binders and a reservation for the conference room on Thursday.
>>> <<<
I don't like the way you asked, so I'm going to make a phone call until you give up and leave.
>>> <<<
Yeah, the big jerk is still standing there.
>>>
2006-03-21 * 
<<<
Asok, I want you to attend the technology steering committee for me.
>>> <<<
But they are all tall members of senior management. They won't even acknowledge my existence.
>>> <<<
Phfft.
>>> <<<
Hey, Andy, this seat is free. I'll just move my coffee.
>>>
2006-03-20 * 
<<<
Hello, I need some tech support.
>>> <<<
What's your tech support password?
>>> <<<
I don't have one.
>>> <<<
Well, then I can't help you.
>>> <<<
Since when do you require a password?
>>> <<<
Usually right before lunch.
>>>
2006-03-19 * 
<<<
It's almost time for our 360 degree reviews.
>>> <<<
That means your compensation is partly dependent on the input of your peers.
>>> <<<
I'd hate to see something bad happen to you, like, I don't know...maybe a negative review.
>>> <<<
I've taken the liberty of calculating the value of a good peer review in terms of your next raise.
>>> <<<
Pay me half of that amount, and I'll guarantee a positive outcome.
>>> <<<
How would I know you gave me a good one? Peer reviews are anonymous.
>>> <<<
What is it about me that makes people so distrusting?
>>>
2006-03-18 * 
<<<
Wally, do you ever wonder about your purpose in life?
>>> <<<
My purpose is to transport huge quantities of coffee from the coffee maker to a urinal.
>>> <<<
Suddenly I am filled with despair.
>>> <<<
Hey, while you're up...
>>>
2006-03-17 * 
Would you like to be seated in the loud guy section or no loud guy? Menu <<<
They both sound good. We'll try the loud guy section.
>>> <<<
I hope he has good stories.
>>> <<<
AND THEN!
>>>
2006-03-16 * 
<<<
Wally, what are you feeding the plant outside your cubicle?
>>> <<<
It's a mulch of coffee dregs and my shredded status reports.
>>> <<<
You might want to switch to decaf.
>>>
2006-03-15 * 
<<<
We canceled our plant maintenance contract to save money.
>>> <<<
Each employee will adopt a nearby plant and water it.

Welcome to Dogbert's catch-and-release CEO seminar.
>>> <<<
Catch-and-release is more than a way to hurt fish for entertainment.
>>> <<<
It's a philosophy that will inform your entire life.
>>> <<<
For example, when you acquire a new company, wait a few years and then spin it off.
>>> <<<
When you catch a new spouse, wait a few years and then set it free.
>>> Boot! <<<
When you golf, hit that ball into a hole and then take it out.
>>> <<<
Your ultimate goal is to look decisive without making any real decisions.
>>> <<<
Good seminar. It makes fishing more fun when you know it hurts them!
>>> <<<
Ouch!
>>>
2006-03-11 * 
Yesterday I had a great meeting about Project Wombat. <<<
What?!
>>> <<<
I've been managing that project for six months! How can you have a meeting without inviting me?!!
>>> <<<
Have you noticed that meetings go smoother without any knowledge or expertise?
>>> <<<
Kinda.
>>>
2006-03-10 * 
<<<
My relatives want me to have an arranged marriage.
>>> <<<
If they find someone who's totally hot and has low standards, ask if she has a sister.
>>> <<<
What about love?
>>> <<<
How can you not love that?
>>>
2006-03-09 * 
We're supposed to have our budget approved by Tuesday but that's not written in stone. <<<
Yes it is. I have it right here.
>>> <<<
It was kind of lucky because this is the only one I brought to the meeting.
>>>
2006-03-08 * 
<<<
And then we'll build a second prototype and...
>>> <<<
IT'S NOT IN THE BUDGET.
>>> <<<
Oh, suddenly it's my fault for caring about the budget.
>>>
2006-03-07 * 
There's no purpose for this meeting other than my boss told me to have it. <<<
So let's just sit here silently until our time is up.
>>> <<<
Unless you have something better to do.
>>> <<<
Not really.
>>>
2006-03-06 * 
The legal department says your plan is illegal. <<<
Ask them again.
>>> <<<
Maybe they'll change their minds.
>>> <<<
I'll get on that as soon as I'm done panning for gold in the water fountain.
>>> <<<
That's the spirit!
>>>
2006-03-05 * 
<<<
Alice, my laptop is slowing down. Can you take a look at it?
>>> <<<
Here's the problem. There's too much smut on your hard drive.
>>> <<<
I recommend deleting the film clips that have poor lighting.
>>> <<<
And here's a whole category that you haven't looked at in weeks.
>>> <<<
I'll move those to an external drive in case you need 'em later.
>>> <<<
Wally has all this stuff on the server. You don't need it on your laptop.
>>> <<<
What the...? You pinhead! You disabled your firewall!
>>> <<<
If you work here long enough, your outrage ends up in all of the wrong places.
>>> <<<
Who moved my stapler?!!
>>>
2006-03-04 * 
<<<
We could do the project right for $100,000 or do it wrong for $25,000.
>>> <<<
I believe that the wise King Salmon would say to split the difference and do it for $50,000.
>>> <<<
Fish are stupid.

2006-03-03 * 
Bob will be leaving us after 17 years as vice president of marketing. <<<
Bob's accomplishments include lowering both our margins and our sales while overseeing a series of confusing marketing campaigns.
>>> <<<
I hope you'll all join me in wishing for a piano to fall on his head.
>>>
2006-03-02 * 
<<<
I've been asked to design and build our center of excellence.
>>> <<<
Which, as I understand it, is like a presidential library honoring my life's work.
>>> <<<
In time, people learn to stop asking me questions.
>>>
2006-03-01 * 
What?! You only got a 'B' taking the online ethics course for me? <<<
No one will believe you're me unless you get all perfect scores.
>>> <<<
I...was...tired.
>>> <<<
Why? You only did 300 push-ups for my online gym class!!!
>>>
2006-02-28 * 
I enrolled in a distance learning class to get my master's degree. <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> <<<
GAAA! GAAA! GAAA!
>>> <<<
Is the online degree hard?
>>> <<<
Not so much. I'm taking my midterm exam as we speak.
>>>

Mail Room <<<
My fake arm is here!
>>> <<<
Attach the fake arm to the real shoulder...
>>> <<<
I'll come back when he's off the conference call.
>>> zzz
2006-02-26 * 
<<<
Why is your project months behind?
>>> <<<
I still don't have the user's requirements because she's a complete nut job.
>>> <<<
It's your job to manage that process!
>>> <<<
I complained to her boss, who promptly misinterpreted the problem and ordered her to work on the wrong stuff.
>>> <<<
Then every member of her family got a serious illness. Then she got called to jury duty.
>>> <<<
She promised to give me the requirements this afternoon.
>>> <<<
It was too hard to come up with my own requirements, so I just copied the requirements from another product.
>>> <<<
Is the other product similar to what you want?
>>> <<<
Where are you going with this?

Dogbert's Seminar on Work-Life Balance <<<
This is Allen. He didn't balance his work and personal lives.
>>> <<<
Allen did nothing but work, work, work. And now look at him.
>>> <<<
I'm the one who tried to balance everything. That's Allen. He's a @#!$% CEO now!

2006-02-24 * 
<<<
Welcome to Dogbert's seminar on work-life balance.
>>> <<<
First, review this list of your priorities.
>>> Family Job Exercise Vacation Must-Dos Medical Eating Hygiene Sleep Romance Holidays <<<
You have time for three things. Work and holidays are two. You get to pick the third.

2006-02-23 * 
<<<
You know what's funny? I never studied engineering and I'm your boss.
>>> <<<
In fact, I majored in...um...gosh, I don't remember.
>>> <<<
You forgot your major?
>>> <<<
I don't bother remembering things I can write down.
>>>
2006-02-22 * 
<<<
Wally, why isn't my e-mail working today?
>>> <<<
The Internet is full.
>>> <<<
Great! Now what do I do?
>>> <<<
I wonder if I'm supposed to see anything when it's draining.
>>>
2006-02-21 * 
I got a stomach-ache during my vacation day so I'm changing it to a sick day. <<<
Apparently there's a biological limit to how many potato chips I can eat in a 24-hour period.
>>> <<<
And I'm taking tomorrow as a sick day too. I still have eight bags left.
>>>
2006-02-20 * 
<<<
This week I said I was telecommuting but I really just stayed home and watched TV in my pajamas.
>>> <<<
I'll never know how the TV got into my pajamas. Ha ha!
>>> <<<
Well, you had to be there.
>>>
2006-02-19 * 
<<<
I'm thinking about buying a more fuel efficient car.
>>> <<<
Why?
>>> <<<
It's my patriotic duty to reduce this country's dependency on foreign sources of oil.
>>> <<<
Why?
>>> <<<
Because then the countries that hate us will have less money to fund terrorists.
>>> <<<
Actually, developing countries would buy the oil you saved, thus adequately funding those same terrorists.
>>> <<<
At least I wouldn't be funding them myself.
>>> <<<
Oil is a fungible commodity. The capitalist system virtually guarantees that you'll end up buying the lowest cost oil from sources unknown to you.
>>> <<<
Well, maybe, but I want my car to make a statement.
>>> <<<
And the statement would be 'Hey, everyone, I don't understand what fungible means!'
>>>

The Land of Unrealistic Business Assumptions <<<
We need to find some assumptions about future sales.

Dang! There's only one way across and it's blocked by an inebriated hillbilly.

The Land of Unrealistic Business Assumptions $ GOLD (Take Some) <<<
Suddenly I feel as if anything is possible.
>>> <<<
Hello! We're the consumers who have extraordinarily bad judgment!
>>> <<<
I need more than three of you.
>>> <<<
The hole's a thousand miles deep. The others thought it would be a good idea to come early.
>>> <<<
Ow! Ow!
>>>
2006-02-16 * 
I need help making unrealistic assumptions to support a business case for a bad idea. <<<
Easy.
>>> <<<
There's a hole in the back of our wardrobe closet that leads to a magical world of preposterous business assumptions.
>>> <<<
We don't have a wardrobe closet.
>>> <<<
Assume we do.
>>>
2006-02-15 * 
I can do this feasibility analysis in two minutes. <<<
It's the worst idea in the world. Numbers don't lie.

Our CEO loves the idea.

Luckily assumptions do lie.

2006-02-14 * 
I'd better put some lipstick on this pig. <<<
Behold the most exciting technical challenge since the dawn of the microprocessor!
>>> <<<
I must rub it on my body before I assign it to you...Oooh oooh!
>>> <<<
I'll need tongs.
>>>
2006-02-13 * 
There's no good way to assign a bad project. FWAP! <<<
Do it!
>>> <<<
That was a liberating thought.
>>>
2006-02-12 * 
Our CEO appreciates pushback. <<<
The last thing he wants is a bunch of yes men.
>>> <<<
Don't be afraid to stand your ground. He respects that.
>>> <<<
My plan is to form business units around each product line.
>>> PLAN <<<
Excuse me. We tried that once and it didn't work.
>>> <<<
You're fired. Leave now.

Cruelty or convenience?

I needed a cubicle to store my extra binders.

I heard that you're a certified project management zombie. Is that true?

I'm an assertive and innovative professional, experienced in project and operations management methodology and process development.

He didn't seem dangerous.

I just sat through a three-hour project review meeting.

2006-02-10 * 
Certified Project Management Zombie <<<
Let's review our assumptions, risks, and constraints.
>>> <<<
Your project management style is putting my joi de vivre at risk.
>>> <<<
It's funny because I don't have any.
>>>
2006-02-09 * 
Welcome to Dogbert's school for zombies and/or certified project managers. <<<
The training is the same for either profession. The main difference is that zombies get more sun.
>>> <<<
Repeat after me: I want to calendar an on-site post cutover support review meeting.
>>>
2006-02-08 * 
I'm too busy to learn anything about the projects I'm managing. <<<
I barely have enough time to make critical decisions about them.
>>> <<<
Maybe you're lazy and stupid.

Let's go down to the pond and throw rocks at the ducks.
>>>
2006-02-07 * 
<<<
Asok, you're my new fire warden for the floor.

If there's a fire, your job is to roll around on it until it's out.

What if the whole floor is on fire?
>>> <<<
No one will be timing you.
>>>
2006-02-06 * 
Heh heh! I'll turn my monitor so no passersby can see what I'm doing. <<<
Is he working? Dang! I can't tell.
>>> zzzzz <<<
I'm starting to think I can't read people.
>>> <<<
Dude. I wasn't kidding. Come back later!
>>>
2006-02-05 * 
<<<
Hi, handsome. Are you free for lunch?
>>> <<<
Are you selling something, or do you have a horrible defect that isn't apparent?
>>> <<<
Is it so hard to believe that a hot, intelligent, sane woman would be attracted to a man like you?
>>> <<<
Gaaa!!! It's worse than I thought!
>>> <<<
Maybe we could just drink coffee and talk about the last episode of Battlestar Galactica.
>>> <<<
GAAA!!!
>>> <<<
Get away from me, you perfect monster!

There must be a guy in the engineering department who will date me.

<<<
Dilbert, I'd like you to accompany Alan on a sales call.
>>> <<<
You'll explain how our product works with their current system. Alan will crack jokes and collect a huge commission.
>>> <<<
It might sound unfair, but these are good jokes.
>>> <<<
Like 'What can I do you for?'
>>>
2006-02-02 * 
I was wondering if you could stop by this weekend and show me how to install my wireless network. <<<
Under what theory are the competent obliged to help the incompetent?
>>> <<<
Wow. This is awkward.
>>> <<<
Watch what happens when I just stare at you.
>>>
2006-02-01 * 
<<<
Hey, Dilbert, would you mind stopping by my house after work and seeing if you can fix my computer?
>>> <<<
Sure. And while I do that you can be at my house cleaning the grout in my shower.
>>> <<<
That's crazy talk.
>>> <<<
Hey, I'm not the one who majored in comparative literature.
>>>
2006-01-31 * 
Catbert: <<<
Evil Director of Human Resources<Br>"Alice, you've been accused of making dismissive facial expressions.
>>> <<<
You have also muttered the following sounds during meetings: piff, bah, ffff, and ssstoop.
>>> <<<
Did anyone complain about this expression? I like to use it in these situations.
>>> <<<
No, that's still good.
>>>
2006-01-30 * 
What does MFU2 mean on your timeline? <<<
That's Management Foul-Up number two. It usually happens around the third week.
>>> <<<
We don't anticipate any management mistakes.
>>> <<<
That's MFU1.

2006-01-29 * 
<<<
I'll need to know your requirements before I start to design the software.
>>> <<<
First of all, what are you trying to accomplish?
>>> <<<
I'm trying to make you design my software.
>>> <<<
I mean what are you trying to accomplish with the software?
>>> <<<
I won't know what I can accomplish until you tell me what the software can do.
>>> <<<
Try to get this concept through your thick skull: The software can do whatever I design it to do!
>>> <<<
Can you design it to tell you my requirements?
>>>
2006-01-28 * 
You're too cute to work in engineering. I'm transferring you to sales. <<<
No one wants to hurt a baby. Use that to your advantage.
>>> <<<
And if you buy the deluxe package I won't be emotionally scarred for life.
>>>
2006-01-27 * 
<<<
Your powers of cuteness are formidable indeed, but can you do...
>>> <<<
THIS?
>>> <<<
Oh crud. You win. Why do I even try?
>>>
2006-01-26 * 
<<<
He wasn't wearing an I.D. badge. We think he's some sort of spy.
>>> <<<
Don't look directly at him. His power of cuteness is too strong.
>>> <<<
Aw, geez. I say don't look and you look right at it.
>>> <<<
Must serve baby.
>>>
2006-01-25 * 
<<<
Hi everyone. Sorry I'm late.
>>> <<<
I have the worst case of jet lag ever. I'm still a baby in this time zone.
>>> <<<
I don't think it works that way.
>>> <<<
Hey, I just got a crazy idea.
>>>
2006-01-24 * 
<<<
Wally, what's the status on the RDP project?
>>> <<<
Am I working on that one?
>>> <<<
You've been in charge of it for a year.
>>> <<<
Oh. In that case, it's almost done.
>>> <<<
Half of being a manager is living with a vague feeling of uneasiness.
>>>
2006-01-23 * 
Did you ever come to work on Monday and realize that you forgot how to do your job? <<<
Only a total moron would forget over the weekend how to do his job.
>>> <<<
O-o-okay. I'm starting to remember who you two are.
>>>
2006-01-22 *

Are you taking me to jail for making a bad analogy?

My boss wants me to integrate a great product with a terrible one just to validate our merger. <<<
Is it ethical for me to stall for a month until he forgets what he asked for?
>>> <<<
Sure. You can even hit him with a rock to speed up the forgetting.
>>> <<<
Maybe I'm asking the wrong ethicist.
>>>
2006-01-18 * 
<<<
Dilbert, come up with a plan to integrate our product with the one we acquired through the merger.
>>> <<<
Okay. My plan is to throw away the competitor's product because it's just a cheap knock-off of our product.

How about a plan that doesn't make our CEO look like a moron?

He could stop wearing sleeveless sweaters.

I told our CEO that the design would be done in a month. He's ecstatic!

That would be good except that I told you it won't be done for six months.

Ooh.

So, I guess you'll have to tell him.

It's too late.

He's already issued a press release. You'll have to finish the design in a month.

The only way to do it in a month is to accept massive design flaws that will destroy a billion dollar line of business.

That's okay. My stock options are so underwater that it won't make any difference.

Nice use of forehead wrinkles. You're hired.
>>> <<<
Grrrr...
>>>
2005-11-02 * 
<<<
Flashy, do you mind if I turn up the thermostat a few degrees?
>>> <<<
Yes. It's boiling in here.
>>> <<<
Would you mind if we built a device that would redirect the radiant heat from your body?
>>> <<<
Okay, fine.
>>> <<<
I should have asked more questions.
>>>
2005-11-01 * 
<<<
Everyone meet our new team member, Flashy.
>>> <<<
GAAA!!! Suddenly so hot!!! Burning!!!
>>> <<<
Flashy will be in the cubicle by the thermostat.
>>> <<<
C-c-c-cold!
>>>
2005-10-31 * 
How does my project fit into our company's overall strategy? <<<
Beats me. I didn't even know we had a strategy.
>>> <<<
Never ask a question if you don't want to hear the answer.
>>> <<<
That's why I never say 'How are you?'
>>>
2005-10-30 * 
<<<
Tex, I'd like you to meet Asok, our intern.
>>> <<<
Asok? What kind of name is that? Are you a taxi driver?
>>> <<<
Um...no.
>>> <<<
I've produced bigger things than you by eating fiber!
>>> <<<
Do they have schools where you came from?
>>> <<<
Actually, Asok graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology. So if I were you, I wouldn't make him angry.
>>> <<<
Why? What's he gonna do? Gnaw on my ankle?
>>> <<<
Explode! Explode!
>>> BOOM! <<<
They taught you some good stuff.
>>> <<<
Nah. You can't even get in unless you can do that.
>>>
2005-10-29 * 
<<<
Research has shown that happiness is not related to one's absolute level of wealth.
>>> <<<
What matters is one's relative wealth compared to other people.
>>> <<<
So, if I do a good job, could you cut this guy's pay?
>>>
2005-10-28 * 
Then I was visited by the Specter of Unpaid Overtime. He hit me with his rake because he's trying to become a grim reaper. <<<
Hee hee!!
>>> <<<
I just realized that I only enjoy your stories when they involve you getting hit by a rake.
>>> <<<
That only happened once.
>>> <<<
I plan to tell the gardener that you insulted his wife.
>>>
2005-10-27 * 
<<<
Management is pleased to announce that it has a plan to make your pension fun solvent.
>>> <<<
In unrelated news, the guidelines for workplace safety have been relaxed.
>>> <<<
Our CEO reminds you that smoking is cool.
>>>
2005-10-26 * 
<<<
Someday I hope to get into the grim reaping field.
>>> <<<
I don't mind working these unpaid overtime cases, but just once I'd like to see one of you guys die.
>>> <<<
Hey, I just realized that my rake is very blunt.
>>>
2005-10-25 * 
<<<
I am the Specter of Unpaid Overtime.
>>> <<<
I will guide you to the shadowy region that is neither life nor death. It is existence without meaning.
>>> <<<
Where is this awful place?
>>> <<<
Right here. And if any sticky notes fall on the floor, I'll rake 'em up.
>>>
2005-10-24 * 
<<<
You know what two things are very similar?
>>> <<<
Unpaid overtime and death. They both deny me the pleasures of being alive.
>>> <<<
How about a good night kiss?
>>> <<<
Hey, you found a third thing!
>>>
2005-10-23 * 
Catbert: <<<
Evil Director of Human Resources <<<
I have new guidelines on who can fly on the same plane.
>>> <<<
We can't risk losing too many key employees.
>>> <<<
The CEO and the president are not allowed to be on the same flight.
>>> <<<
No more than three vice presidents may be on the same flight.
>>> <<<
What are the guidelines for interns?
>>> <<<
Infinite interns are allowed on the same flight. You are also allowed to run with scissors and put plastic bags over your heads.
>>> <<<
How many interns are allowed per plastic bag?
>>>
2005-10-22 * 
<<<
The trouble with hiring a hit man is that you have to have him killed to cover your tracks.
>>> <<<
Then you need a hit man to hit the guy who killed the hit man. It's an endless cycle!
>>> <<<
But ultimately, it's all free, right?
>>>
2005-10-21 * 
<<<
Bob, my boss might be planning to kill me. Would you be my bodyguard?
>>> <<<
I can't because I'm all busy eating a carrot stick.
>>> <<<
How about after you finish it?
>>> <<<
You mean nap time? Be serious!
>>>
2005-10-20 * 
I'm afraid that my boss will try to kill me because I know about his malfeasance. <<<
I recommend that you ask to meet him alone at an abandoned warehouse.
>>> <<<
It was a mistake to name you the beneficiary on my life insurance policy.
>>> <<<
Remember to insult his goons.
>>>
2005-10-19 * 
I need you to delete all of our incriminating e-mails before the court sees them. <<<
That plan is no good because I'd be a witness to the crime...unless you had me killed.
>>> <<<
Phase Two is none of your concern.
>>> <<<
It has a phase???
>>>
2005-10-18 * 
Company Lawyer <<<
The court ordered us to turn over all of our e-mail records.
>>> <<<
Gosh, I sure hope they don't get deleted during regularly scheduled system maintenance.
>>> <<<
Oh no. That would be bad! Wink! Wink!
>>> <<<
Good grief, man! How can you be flirting at a time like this?
>>>
2005-10-17 * 
Our shareholders are suing us for misleading them about our financial problems. <<<
Since when is it illegal to shaft innocent people for personal gain?
>>> <<<
Don't put that in the minutes.
>>> <<<
I'll see what I can do.
>>>
2005-10-16 * 
SALE <<<
I'll take that chair.
>>> <<<
Excellent choice.
>>> <<<
Now sit there quietly and try not to ask the one question that will kill this sale.
>>> <<<
Is the chair in stock?
>>> <<<
GAAA!!!
>>> <<<
The truth is that we don't sell chairs at all. We sell the hope that a chair will someday be made for you.
>>> <<<
How long will that take?
>>> <<<
If I could answer that question, it would be the same as selling you an actual chair.
>>> <<<
How about if I tell you it will ship in two months, and you call and yell at me every three months for eternity?
>>> <<<
Did you buy a chair?
>>> <<<
There's no way to know.
>>>
2005-10-15 * 
<<<
I'd like to return this Frisbee (TM). It doesn't fly right.
>>> <<<
This is a software CD. Only a total idiot would think it was a Frisbee (TM).
>>> <<<
In my defense, the user's manual was poorly written.
>>> <<<
Plus you're a total idiot.
>>>
2005-10-14 * 
<<<
Our total sales to Elbonia are one package of software.
>>> <<<
That can only mean that they're engaged in massive software piracy.
>>> <<<
When I toss the tiny Frisbee (TM), you leap in the air and catch it in your mouth.
>>> <<<
You first.
>>>
2005-10-13 * 
I took the liberty of calculating how rich you'd have to be... <<<
Before I'd be willing to date you. The number is four trillion dollars.
>>> <<<
You're happily married.
>>> <<<
That's all factored in.
>>>
2005-10-12 * 
<<<
Carol, you're the worst secretary ever. I have to let you go.
>>> <<<
You can't fire me until you fill out the Involuntary Termination Form 904-B.
>>> <<<
Can you get me one of those?
>>> <<<
Yeah. I'll get right on that.

2005-10-11 * 
Tina writes the Annual Report All trends are positive.
>>> Footnote 5: <<<
Unless you consider our crushing debt, moronic management, and aging product line. <<<
What font is this? It's so tiny.
>>> <<<
Enron Beelzebub.
>>>
2005-10-10 * 
<<<
Tina, I want you to write our annual report.
>>> <<<
How should I explain our poor results?
>>> <<<
Just give it a positive spin.
>>> <<<
If you have to ask why our stock keeps plummeting, you can't afford us.
>>>
2005-10-09 * 
Bias for Action Passion for Results <<<
And these are our company values.
>>> <<<
Please don't ask any questions.
>>> <<<
Question!
>>> <<<
Do the results have to be good ones?
>>> <<<
Um...yes.
>>> <<<
I'm not so sure. I think it would say that.
>>> <<<
Since action and results are both important, is it okay to have bad results so long as it takes twice as much action?
>>> <<<
JUST DO EVERYTHING SOON AND PERFECTLY!!!
>>> <<<
Is it my imagination or is he all over the map on this?
>>> <<<
I forget what we were talking about.
>>>
2005-10-08 * 
<<<
Hi. I'm calling to check the references of your ex-employee named Ted.
>>> <<<
We have a company policy against giving references. But I'd be happy to discuss the weather with you.
>>> <<<
Okay.

The clouds are moving lazily across the sky, and everyone thinks they're stupid.

Dogbert writes a F.A.Q. for the company web site <<<
Question 8: Why won't my file open when I'm eating toast?
>>> <<<
Answer 8: That is the stupidest question ever! Do not have children!
>>> <<<
I sure hope someone asks that question.
>>>
2005-10-06 * 
I hired Mr. Dogbert to write the F.A.Q. for our web site. <<<
The key is to anticipate our customers' most likely questions.
>>> <<<
Question 1: Where does your CEO live? I need to know so I can throw your cruddy project through his biggest window.
>>>
2005-10-05 * 
<<<
It's a harpoon. I see a lot of this.
>>> <<<
It's caused by a combination of doughnut-eating and agitating a secretary.
>>> <<<
Can you remove it?
>>> <<<
Yes, but it will just come back at Annual Review time.
>>>
2005-10-04 * 
<<<
Carol, why don't I have any meetings today?
>>> <<<
Your meetings create work for me, so I canceled them.
>>> <<<
Maybe I could drop in on some people.
>>> <<<
Harpoon.
>>>
2005-10-03 * 
<<<
I need five minutes on the pointy-haired boss' calendar.
>>> <<<
No can do.
>>> <<<
If I give you an appointment, I'll just have to cancel it later when something more important comes up.
>>> <<<
What's he doing now?
>>> <<<
Combing his knuckles.
>>>
2005-10-02 * 
<<<
Ted, you've been saying negative things about the company in your personal blog. We have to fire you.
>>> <<<
I have freedom of speech. It's my constitutional right to say whatever I want.
>>> <<<
If you fire me for my opinions, you'll be spitting on the graves of our founding fathers.
>>> <<<
I'll get the best lawyer that money can't buy, and fight you all the way to the Supreme Court!
>>> <<<
The only way you can legally fire me is if my work isn't good.
>>> <<<
Ooh. I probably said too much here.
>>> <<<
Your work isn't good. Here's your final paycheck.
>>> <<<
Stupid founding fathers.
>>>
2005-10-01 * 
The employee satisfaction survey says they don't trust management. <<<
Don't worry. I'll find out who feels that way and fire them during the next retrenchment.
>>> <<<
Purr? Who said purr?
>>>
2005-09-30 * 
<<<
I have a job offer from another company, but I'll give you a chance to buy my loyalty.
>>> <<<
Now I just sit back and let the loving begin.
>>> <<<
And his opening offer is...
>>> <<<
That's right: Whack him in the parking lot.

Wally Interviews <<<
The job doesn't have a base salary.
>>> <<<
You'll pay us $1,000 per month and work from home. If you make any money for us, we'll give you 10%.

You're not allowed to have business cards. And you can't use our name.

I've decided to test my market value by doing some interviews. <<<
Would you like some interview tips?

Nah. I'll use my instincts.

Here's a list of gifts I received on National Boss Day. <<<
Sort them by dollar value and assign annual raises based on who gave the most.

Now I regret the Sculpture-o-Gum.
>>>
2005-09-25 * 
Hello! Hello! <<<
Let me see that. I'm an engineer.
>>> <<<
Hmm...It might be a bad signal or maybe a bad phone. There's only one way to isolate the problem.
>>> <<<
Go up on the roof and see if you have reception there.
>>> <<<
Dang. Nothing.
>>> <<<
Uh-oh. The door is locked. No other way to get down...No one can hear me yell and my phone doesn't work.
>>> <<<
My only hope is to jump into that open garbage bin in the alley.
>>> <<<
That'll teach him to keep his battery charged.
>>>
2005-09-24 * 
<<<
What's up with the face?
>>> <<<
I'm practicing my work grimace.
>>> <<<
This face says, 'I'm so overworked that I can't possibly do any more'.
>>> <<<
I'm also getting a message of intestinal discomfort.
>>> <<<
It's a subplot.
>>>
2005-09-23 * 
<<<
Wally, I've been watching you for half an hour and you've done no work.
>>> <<<
I'm waiting for my program to compile while I design the next module in my head.
>>> <<<
Could you grimace so I know you're working?
>>> <<<
Here you go.
>>>
2005-09-22 * 
<<<
I'm an attorney. If my client is injured by this time machine, I will sue!

I think you should consult with your client before being so belligerent.

Dogbert Consults <<<
Your time machine is a fraud, but no one needs to know.

With a few minor modifications, the user will vanish, and everyone will assume it worked.

This is in case you don't completely vanish.

Question: <<<
If our new product takes you sixty minutes into the future in one hour... <<<
Isn't that the same as doing nothing at all?
>>> <<<
It also makes you lose weight if you stay in it long enough...while not eating.
>>>
2005-09-19 * 
We've narrowed our target market to this guy. <<<
He's the only one rich enough and stupid enough to buy our high-end product.

Our diamond-encrusted time machine will take you one hour into the future in only sixty minutes!

2005-09-18 * 
I want to get a good base tan before I take my vacation. <<<
That'll prevent me from getting a sunburn when I go to the beach.
>>> <<<
I think it's a myth that a base tan can protect you from sunburns.
>>> <<<
You are so wrong! Let's make a bet. The loser has to jump into that freezing pond.
>>> <<<
Fine. I'll do a search on my wireless computer. Here you go: A base tan provides only a negligible SPF 4 protection.
>>> <<<
I'm not jumping into that freezing pond.
>>> PUSH <<<
You were already ignorant and contentious. I didn't want you to be a welcher too.
>>>
2005-09-17 * 
<<<
I didn't think it was possible, but for the past month I've done my own job plus Ted's, and done them well.
>>> <<<
I know that you're marveling at my accomplishment and wondering how you can reward me.
>>> <<<
Maybe I can fire Carl and make this idiot do his job too.
>>> <<<
I'll be we're thinking of the same bonus amount!
>>>
2005-09-16 * 
I need you to pick up Ted's function. <<<
No problem. I have infinite capacity to do more work as long as you don't mind that my quality approaches zero.
>>> <<<
Or are you asking me to do something that's logically impossible?
>>> <<<
I think I hate you.
>>>
2005-09-15 * 
<<<
Wally, after I left the meeting yesterday, did you blame me for the failure of the project?
>>> <<<
I'm getting a bad vibe from people today. That sort of rumor could stain my reputation and ruin my entire future.
>>> <<<
How dare you accuse me...
>>> <<<
Well, well. Look who's impeding Wally again.
>>>
2005-09-14 * 
The failure of my project can only be blamed on... BEEP BOOP BEEP <<<
I'll be right there.
>>> <<<
That guy.
>>>
2005-09-13 * 
Do you have the list of invitees for the debriefing meeting? <<<
Here.

I like to blame people who won't be in the room.

Bad news for you: You're not on the list.

Elbonian hackers are trying to steal our source code. <<<
Send our goons to beat them up.

Improve it or else I'll have our goons beat you up.

This is surprisingly motivational.

My goal is to transform you from angry nuts into...

Angry nuts who have paid me.

I need a volunteer for our first demonstration. You, come here.

Put your head about here.

Now try to control your anger while I do this...

Maybe you didn't get enough sleep last night.

You will no longer have access to code on any server but your own.

Is it my imagination, or are all of our rules designed for the sole purpose of being huge inconveniences?

And starting today, all passwords must contain letters, numbers, doodles, sign language and squirrel noises.
>>>
2005-09-09 * 
Having two computers is a violation of the company's 5S rules of standardized workspace. <<<
I need two computers to test my software. There's no way to do my job with one.
>>> <<<
I have a compromise solution. Put this little red tag on one of them and tell me later if anything bad happens.
>>>
2005-09-08 * 
<<<
Carol, shred this.
>>> <<<
The shredder is right behind you, next to the fax.
>>> <<<
What if I do it wrong?

Only a complete moron could do it wrong.

Um...I think I might have just faxed our strategy someplace.

And that's why you never see a water fountain in a men's restroom.

There's no law that says a porpoise can't kill a company lawyer, but it's still somewhat bad.
>>> <<<
Officially, I have to give you a reprimand.
>>> <<<
Unofficially, do you like mackerel?
>>> Squeak!
>>>
2005-09-06 * 
<<<
I heard that porpoises are smart, so I hired one.
>>> <<<
Porpoises have been known to save humans by attacking sharks with their snouts.
>>> <<<
He looks like our company lawyer, but more surprised.
>>>
2005-09-05 * 
I made a fortune by being an incompetent CEO. Everyone called me crazy when I put my entire personal wealth into pigs and garbage dumps. <<<
You invested all of your money in pigs and dumps?
>>> <<<
Invested? Now that would have been a good idea too.
>>>
2005-09-04 * 
<<<
The trouble started when you insisted on giving inspirational names to the conference rooms.
>>> <<<
I scheduled a project meeting for the 'Quality' room and no one knew where to go.
>>> <<<
Some people ended up in the 'Teamwork' room while others went to the 'Excellence' room.
>>> <<<
By the time we sorted it all out, someone else was scheduled to use our conference room.
>>> <<<
Then it took three weeks to schedule another meeting when everyone could make it.
>>> <<<
But half of the team went to the 'Action' room and sat there while we waited for them in the 'Good Planning' room.
>>> <<<
I thought this was the budget meeting.
>>>
2005-09-03 * 
I'm the editor of the department newsletter. That makes you my cub reporter. <<<
Cub reporter??? I have an engineering degree from the India Institute of Technology - the most challenging university on the planet.
>>> <<<
That'll come in handy during the copying phase. We get some fierce paper jams.
>>>
2005-09-02 * 
I have completed all of my projects and I am ready for a new challenge. <<<
You can help Tina write the department newsletter.

But the newsletter job is only given to the most worthless employee.

Why do I always get the seat next to the cannibal?

These guys are all the same. I know what's going to happen next.

My hairy skull isn't touching you.

Right on schedule.

2005-08-31 * 
<<<
Are there meals on this flight?
>>> <<<
Yes, if you're a cannibal.
>>> Elbonia Airlines <<<
That is not funny. After this flight, I'm going to complain to your supervisor.
>>> <<<
Can you put me next to the plump guy?
>>> <<<
Sure. He's in B8.
>>>
2005-08-30 * 
<<<
Per company policy, I got you the least expensive flight available.
>>> <<<
Your trip will have 17 connecting flights and you're required to spend at least one night 'in an Elbonian prison, dressed as a ballerina.'" <<<
How much would I have to desecrate a national monument to get one night in jail?
>>>
2005-08-29 * 
I decided to start a discount religion. <<<
The tithing would only be 5% and I'd let people sin as much as they wanted.

The only problem is that I don't want to spend time with anyone who would join that sort of religion.

2005-08-28 * 
<<<
My job could not be more meaningless.

I'm looking at my new Director of Post-Decision Support!

After I make a decision, your job is to figure out why it was the right one.
>>> <<<
Save those tears of joy for later. We've got work to do!
>>> <<<
SOB!
>>> <<<
I decided to outsource our nuclear contracts to North Elbonia.
>>> <<<
And in return, they'll give us food, if they ever figure out how to grow any.
>>> <<<
I expect some fallout from this decision.

Me too.
>>> <<<
On the plus side, it won't be long before there's a government reward for killing him.

2005-08-27 * 
Catbert: <<<
Evil Director of Human Resources <<<
I call it a stealth layoff.

We move all of the worthless employees to the same project. When it's done, we tell them that their jobs no longer exist.

The project was moving along well until management changed our coding language and methodology. <<<
Now our timeline is represented by this M.C. Escher print of an endless stairway.

This deep-sea submarine is looking for our morale.
>>> <<<
Would this be a bad time to add a few features?
>>>
2005-08-24 * 
How's the coding coming along? <<<
No problem unless...
>>> <<<
...some moron tries to standardize on a new programming methodology in the middle of the project.
>>> <<<
What if it's me instead of some moron guy?
>>>
2005-08-23 * 
<<<
I've decided to standardize the department on a new programming language.
>>> <<<
With all due respect, that sort of decision should be made by someone who knows his mass from a black hole.
>>> <<<
The vendor warned me that you couldn't be objective.
>>>
2005-08-22 * 
<<<
Aha! Just the person I need.

Meet with the LDC and make sure the MRT gets URPed when the RFIT gets NERKed to the ORCAT.

If you have any questions, I don't have time for that sort of thing.

<<<
Good evening. This is the Dogbert Easy News Channel.
>>> <<<
We bring you all the news that's easy to gather.
>>> <<<
Today's top story is about something that was first reported in a newspaper and later read by me.
>>> <<<
People in other countries want to kill us. The rest of the article is mostly names I can't pronounce.
>>> <<<
We thought about asking them why they want to kill us, but they don't have phones.
>>> <<<
So here's the next best thing: a debate between two middle-aged white guys who also don't know why people want to kill us.
>>> <<<
They hate us because we are so wonderful.
>>> <<<
Buy my book or you will all die!
>>> <<<
Next on Easy News, our panelists wll discuss dumb crooks who keep getting stuck in chimneys.
>>> <<<
Excellent.
>>>
2005-08-20 * 
A prestigious window-facing cubicle has just become available. <<<
It'll be a perfect place to store all the printer paper I bought so I could win a free trip from the paper vendor.

Topper vs. the Boss <<<
It was the biggest fish ever caught in that lake!
>>> <<<
That's nothing.
>>> <<<
I once caught a dinosaur by using nothing but dental floss and a pull tab from a beer can.
>>> <<<
I'd like to see this alleged dinosaur.
>>> <<<
Too late. I also make the world's best barbecue sauce.
>>>
2005-08-18 * 
Topper versus Alice <<<
I didn't get much sleep last night.
>>> <<<
That's nothing.
>>> <<<
I'm part of a secret government test on sleep deprivation. I haven't slept since February.
>>> <<<
I so want to punch you right now.
>>> <<<
That's nothing. I'll rip off my own head and make me eat it.
>>>
2005-08-17 * 
Topper vs. a Customer <<<
I competed in the Iditarod, an 1,150-mile dogsled race lasting 15 days, over the world's toughest terrain.
>>> <<<
That's nothing. I completed the race while pretending to be one of your dogs.
>>> <<<
Now I don't want to buy from your company.

That's nothing. Now I plan to burn my company to the ground!

Hello-o-o, Asok.

GAAA!!! What are you doing here?!!
>>> <<<
It's time for the annual Employee Satisfaction Survey.
>>> <<<
Perhaps I overreacted. I don't see how this could possibly be bad.
>>> <<<
It is evident from these questions that you care about my wellbeing!
>>> <<<
I love the part where they think I'm here to help.

They're delighted with their benefits.  It looks like we can save some money there.

Hurry.

2005-08-12 *

I have a new hobby. It's called phishing.

I send fake banking e-mails to gullible executives. Then I find out their financial information and use it to steal the money they don't deserve.
>>> Dear Customer, This is your bank. We forgot your social security number and password. Why don't you send them to us so we can protect your money. Sincerely, I. B. Banker <<<
Looks legit.

The project post-mortem will only be helpful if each of you is honest about what went wrong.

Your colossal ineptitude as a leader suppressed our natural talents, leaving us listless and unfocused.

And by 'honest', I mean blaming people who aren't here.

Look! You're doing it again!

Wally, I want you to represent our company in the corporate marathon.

Um...I can't run 26 miles.
>>> <<<
Yes, you can. I've designed a special hat to help you.
>>> <<<
What the...?
>>>
2005-08-09 * 
I have some good news and some bad news. <<<
The good news is that the company is going to sponsor a corporate marathon team.
>>> <<<
The bad news is that one of you has to run 26 miles tomorrow.
>>>
2005-08-08 * 
I have good news about the promotion you wanted: You didn't get it! <<<
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY CALL THAT GOOD NEWS?

They don't like positivity.

Please don't discuss your raise with co-workers.

Whatever.

Let's see how the losers and morons did.

You only got 6%? I got 8%.

Sounds like it.

Sometimes I feel guilty because my company sells defective products.

I believe in karma.  That means I can do bad things to people all day and I assume they deserve it.

I think we wandered into a bad doodle.

How'd your brain transplant work out?
>>>
2005-07-29 * 
<<<
First I'll saw open your head. Then I'll replace your faulty brain with a fresh cauliflower.
>>>
 <<<
How do I know you won't put me to sleep, eat the cauliflower and claim the operation worked?
>>>
 <<<
That reminds me: your insurance doesn't cover anesthesia.
>>>
2005-07-28 * 
<<<
I'm referring you to a specialist who can treat your absent-mindedness.
>>>
 <<<
His method is untested, but I think it's worth a chance.
>>>
 <<<
You'll replace my brain with a cauliflower?
>>>
 <<<
They're just like brains, but much cheaper.
>>>
2005-07-27 * 
<<<
I keep forgetting where I put things.
>>>
 <<<
The problem is that you're stupid.
>>>
 <<<
I recommend replacing your brain with a monkey brain.

 <<<
Will that help?
>>>
 <<<
No, I just hate monkeys.
>>>
2005-07-26 *

Alice, where are the quality estimates that I asked you for an hour ago?

 <<<
It's between your left arm and your stout torso, about elbow-high.

Stupid elbow.

The company requires me to give failing performance reviews to 20% of my staff.

There are four of you, so that works out to...80% of a person.

Wally, your calf muscles and ankles are performing well, but the rest of you is monkey hurlage.

2005-07-24 * 
<<<
I have a great idea.

I was chatting with the director of marketing and we....
>>>
 <<<
WHAT?!!
>>>
 <<<
Never discuss ideas with the director of marketing! Never!
>>>
 <<<
Erk!
>>>
 <<<
You work for me! When you talk to others managers it undercuts my authority!
>>>
 <<<
If I accept ideas from another manager, it's just like he's my boss!
>>>
 <<<
Amazing! Did you know that your behavior is described on page 27 of the 'Putrid Boss' Book? It's the chapter on killing initiative and bullying!
>>>
 <<<
That's fascinating. Now let me show you something that isn't in the book.
>>>
 <<<
It looks like someone has been showing initiative.

Please shut up.

The best way to make this decision is by calculating the expected value of each possible outcome.

We won the Elbonia bid, but I had to promise we'd give them plans to build a nuclear warhead.
>>>
 <<<
Don't worry. I got the plans off the Internet and I modified a few things.
>>>
 <<<
Now all we need is some highly enriched bread.
>>>
2005-07-20 * 
The Elbonians won't do business with my company unless we bribe them.
>>>
2005-07-19 * 
<<<
The Elbonians are demanding bribes, or else they won't do business with us.
>>>
 <<<
Hire them as overpaid consultants and don't ask them for anything. That way, it's all legal.
>>>
 <<<
And by legal you mean won't get caught?
>>>
 <<<
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.
>>>
2005-07-18 * 
<<<
Your bid to build our cell phone network is the lowest by far.
>>>
 <<<
But I'd feel more comfortable if it had an illegal component.
>>>
 <<<
Like a bribe? Or helping you build a nuclear weapon?
>>>
 <<<
Yes, just something to add flavor.

2005-07-17 * 
<<<
This budget would only work if the project encountered no problems whatsoever.
>>>
 <<<
So?
>>>
 <<<
All projects have unexpected problems. Therefore, this budget is almost certainly wrong.
>>>
 <<<
Leaders do not plan for failure.
>>>
 <<<
Do leaders make deceptive forecasts and later act shocked when things don't work out?
>>>
 <<<
No.
>>>
 <<<
A leader first makes himself believe the lie, thus turning deception into an inspiring form of optimism. Observe.
>>>
 <<<
GAAA!!! BELIEVE! BELIEVE!

 <<<
The swelling will go down in a few hours. Then we'll have a perfect budget.

I invented a cure for the common cold.

Only if you have a cold.

Asok, the move that I am about to teach you is called the 'Wally Reflector.'

Throughout the day, bad people will try to make you do work for them.

At first, offer no resistance, as if you actually plan to do the work.
>>>
 <<<
Then ask the offender to do a little bit of work himself.
>>>
 <<<
Allow me to demonstrate.
>>>
 <<<
Wally, I need you to design a database for all of our product features and services.
>>>
 <<<
Glad to do it!

All I need from you is a comprehensive list of the data fields you need included.

 <<<
Oh...Wow. I'm really busy. I'll have to get back to you on that.

And I'll never see that idiot again.

You inspire me, in a creepy kind of way.

2005-07-08 * 
Do you think it's fair that you keep spitting on me just because you disagree with what I say?

2005-07-07 *

When you do something that I don't like, I'll let you know by cursing and then spitting on your forehead.

Maybe you could just tell me what I did wrong.

Dilbert, come to my office for a minute.

 <<<
What's in your office?

You and I will be there.

If you just want to talk, we can do it right here and save us both some time.
>>>
 <<<
Maybe we need privacy, did you ever think of that?
>>>
 <<<
Do we need it?
>>>
 <<<
No, that was just an example. There are many, many reasons why we should talk in my office.

I'll be fascinated to find out what kind of information is geographically dependent.

Now, do you have the results from the Benchmark Tests?
>>>
 <<<
Yup. In my cubicle.

What documented process did you use to decide what documented process to use?

Or is this one of those shoddy mistakes I keep hearing about?

You're a successful engineer and I'm a failed CEO. It's kind of funny that I'm worth $100 million and you're not. <<<

The board has learned that you've been dipping employees in varnish and using them as office furniture.

Ratbert the CEO <<<
I've only been CEO for two days and already I'm losing my empathy.

It reminds me of Eqyptian Hieroglyphics. Are you sure they didn't patent it?

Um...I don't think that's likely.
>>> <<<
But there's still some risk?
>>> <<<
First of all, I didn't use Hieroglyphics. Secondly, the ancient Egyptians didn't have microchips. Thirdly, they didn't have patent laws.
>>> <<<
Good point. <<<

Oh yeah? Then how did they build pyramids?

That;s because eagles can't type.

The motivational poster in the break says I should be like an eagle.

The point of that poster is that your spirit should soar like an eagle while you continue to do mundane work.

Wouldn't I die if my spirit left my body to go soar?
>>> <<<
You're confusing your spirit with your soul.

While your spirit is soaring, your sould should remain, trapped in your body, slowly decaying while you create your status report.

I can't promise that.

I'm guessing that your boss gave uou the regular goals and you came up with the stretch goals on your own.

That way, When I achieve the regular goals you'll get a raise because I missed the stretch goals.

The only way to meet our sales target is by selling to customers who have bad credit.

Did I just say I'm doing a bad job and ask you to punish me?
>>> <<<
That's what I heard.
>>>
2004-12-21 * 
Try to get through this meeting without teling our customers how stupid you think they're being. <<<
I'll try.
>>> <<<
But sometimes the pressure builds up in my head and it's unbearable.
>>> <<<
Tough it out.
>>> <<<
Is he okay? <<<
He's fine. Ignore him.
>>>
2004-12-20 * 
<<<
I wasn't getting any responses to my online resume until I inserted some key words.
>>> <<<
I said I'm strangely attracted to older, chubby, married men with coffee-stained teeth.
>>> <<<
That is wrong on so many levels.
>>> <<<
Explain that to my six thousand job offers.
>>>
2004-12-19 * 
<<<
I have a job interview. Wish me luck.
>>> <<<
No.
>>> <<<
If you get extra luck then there might be less available for me.
>>> <<<
I don't think it works that way.
>>> <<<
I can't take that chance.
>>> <<<
Tell me, Dilbert, who would you consider your hero?
>>> <<<
Albert Einstein.
>>> <<<
That should be safe.
>>> <<<
Oh, really? He was an outspoken critic of war. We design missle guidance systems.
>>> <<<
How about Jeffrey Dahmer? No?
>>> <<<
I won the lottery!

Your cousin Lauren just got her degree in English.  Can you give her some career advice? <<<
Would you enjoy scratching out a meager living in a frustrating work environment?

I've never thought about it.

Obviously.

TV Stock Analyst  <<<
Do you own stock in the company you recommended?
>>> <<<
No. I used my blackberry to dump my shares a soon as they spiked from my recommmedation.
>>> <<<
This is very wrong.
>>> <<<
Now I'm using the profit to buy a helicopter.
>>>
2004-12-15 * 
<<<
I'll recommend your stock to the public, but first I need some conflicts of interest to make it worthwhile.
>>> <<<
For example, I'll need to get your investment banking business.
>>> <<<
Okay.
>>> <<<
And you need to merge with my other client that makes poison waffles.
>>> <<<
Okay.
>>>
2004-12-14 * 
I didn't like the way he was looking at me. <<<
This isn't good.
>>> <<<
He was the only stock analyst who had a "buy" recommendation on our company.
>>> <<<
I think we're a "hold" now.
>>> <<<
Where will we find another one with so much conflict of interest??!
>>>
2004-12-13 * 
<<<
I don't know who you are, but I don't like all of the questions you're asking.
>>> <<<
I'm going to ram my fist down your throat, grab your pants and turn you inside out.
>>> <<<
Eat death, stranger!
>>> <<<
I see you've met our stock analyst.

2004-12-12 * 
Job interview <<<
What's your biggest weakness.
>>> <<<
I'm a cubicle vampire.
>>> <<<
I wander the cubicles in search of happy coworkers.
>>> <<<
Then I pounce!
>>> <<<
Then you suck their blood?
>>> <<<
That was the old way.
>>> <<<
I talk about work-related issues until the life is drained from their bodies.
>>> <<<
I'm going to trust my gut instinct on this. You're hired.
>>> <<<
Have you met the new hire yet?
>>>
2004-12-11 * 
Remember: <<<
Knowledge is power. <<<
So never tell people anything because they might use it to crush you.
>>> <<<
Do you understand?
>>> <<<
I'm not saying.
>>>
2004-12-10 * 
I've decided to become indispensible to the company. <<<
Indispensible employees can get away with outrageously annoying behavior.
>>> <<<
You're already pretty annoying.
>>> <<<
I've been reading up on crushed ice chomping.
>>>
2004-12-09 * 
Let me explain what video compression is... <<<
Would you stop if I pointed out that everyone in this room except you is an electrical engineer?
>>> <<<
Zeros are round and fat compared to ones...
>>> <<<
I'm begging you...

2004-12-08 * 
Your blinding flashes of the obvius made me sightless for three days. <<<
I hope you didn't drive your car.  You're not supoosed to do that when you're blind.
>>> <<<
GAAA!!!
>>> <<<
I'm upsetting you.
>>>
2004-12-07 * 
It's temporary blindness caused by your boss's flashes of the obvious. <<<
Let Dogbert guide you for a few days. And here's a prescription to make you dopey.
>>> <<<
Now?
>>> <<<
Whatever.
>>>
2004-12-06 * 
Try working around the problem. <<<
Thank you for that valuable advice.  I had planned to stare at my screen until I starved to death.
>>> <<<
Gather data before making a decision.
>>> <<<
GAAA! I've been blinded by the obvious!
>>>
2004-12-05 * 
<<<
Now what?
>>> <<<
Create a password that's at least six characters long with a mix of letters and numbers.
>>> <<<
How about 123?
>>> <<<
Uh, no.
>>> <<<
It has to include letters and be at least six characters long.
>>> <<<
How about ABC?
>>> <<<
Letters AND numbers and at least six characters LONG!
>>> <<<
Foursome?
>>> <<<
GAAA!
>>>
2004-12-04 * 
<<<
Wally, did you tell our biggest customer that everyone here except you is an escaped felon?
>>> <<<
Maybe.
>>> <<<
Now I can't fire you because they don't trust anyone else.
>>> <<<
The key learning here is that alleged crime doesn't pay.
>>> <<<
I've never been caught!
>>>
2004-12-03 * 
<<<
I need to become irreplaceable so I can't be fired for my behavior.
>>> <<<
I'll gain the trust of our biggest customer so they'll only deal with me.
>>> <<<
I probably shouldn't say this, but everyone in my company except me is an escaped felon.
>>>
2004-12-02 * 
<<<
Every time we cut costs, our distributor, Walgetco, takes the gain by demanding lower prices.
>>> <<<
Thank you for shopping at Walgetco! Have a nice day!
>>> <<<
Maybe it's too late.
>>> <<<
Troll accessories are on aisle six!
>>>
2004-12-01 * 
<<<
Sixty-percent of our distribution goes through Walgetco.
>>> <<<
For all practical purposes, they now own us, except for the legal liabilities.
>>> <<<
They'd like us to wear orange vests and bow toward their headquarters.
>>> <<<
But no touching?
>>>
2004-11-30 * 
<<<
Meet with our huge retail distributor, Walgetco, and find out what they want now.
>>> <<<
Say yes, no matter how unreasonable they are, because we need them more than they need us.
>>> <<<
. . .Special packaging, rfid tags, and grind your bones to make store brand foot powder.
>>> <<<
Yes!
>>>
2004-11-29 * 
Our main product is coming off patent. <<<
Profits will plunge and so will my bonus. It's not fair.
>>> <<<
Call me shallow. But I enjoy getting paid for other people's inventions.
>>> <<<
SHALLOW!
>>>
2004-11-28 * 
<<<
When our pointy-haired boss asks you about your project, what should you say?
>>> <<<
I would inform him about any problems.
>>> <<<
Big mistake. If he hears that you have a problem, he might try to help.
>>> <<<
How can help be bad?
>>> <<<
Asok, how's your project?
>>> <<<
Good, but I need to upgrade my disk drive to store all of the image data.
>>> <<<
Forget that. Just e-mail peices of the database to employees who have extra disc space.
>>> <<<
Please pull on this until I lose consciousness.
>>>
2004-11-27 * 
<<<
Wally, did you complain to human resources about my off-color e-mail joke?
>>> <<<
Yes. I was psycologically damaged by your mirth. Now I'm an empty shell of a man.
>>> <<<
You've ALWAYS been an empty shell of a man!!!
>>> <<<
This is making me hungry.
>>>
2004-11-26 * 
<<<
Can you tell me who complained about my off-color e-mail joke? <<<
No, no, no.

All conversations with human resources are strictly confidential.

Wally, wally, wally, wally, wally, wally, wally...

Catbert: <<<
Evil Director of Human Resources <<<
I understand that you forwarded an off-color e-mail to many people.
>>> <<<
Seventy-Five people thought it was funny but one person complained, so you must be punished.
>>> <<<
Wouldn't it make more sense to punish the freak who complained?
>>> <<<
Do I look sensible?
>>>
2004-11-24 * 
<<<
Alice, you've ben accused of forwarding off-color jokes by e-mail.
>>> <<<
Do you object to the increase in morale or the nickel it cost the company so far?
>>> <<<
I object to my face being photoshopped to a cow's butt.
>>> <<<
You object to art?
>>>
2004-11-23 * 
My progress has been thwarted by a huge obstacle.
>>>
2004-11-22 *

When I was your age, Asok, I too sought the thrill of victory and the pleasure of the flesh.
>>>
 <<<
But after twenty years of not getting either one, I made convenience my new mistress.
>>>
 <<<
You know why I like talking to you?
>>>
 <<<
Because I am a good listener?
>>>
 <<<
No, because you're here.
>>>
2004-11-21 * 
Here's the technical analysis that you asked for.
>>>
2004-11-20 * 
Your biggest defect continues to be your inability to handle criticism.
>>>
2004-11-19 * 
There must be more to managing than giving vague directions and punishing people for not reading my mind.
>>>
2004-11-18 * 
<<<
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
>>>
 <<<
I wasn't listening.  I'll try some optimism.  That works in every situation.

I hope we'll see record growth!

I want them customized for our needs, assembled, and installed by Wednesday.

You got it!

I'm loathing you in advance for making promises you won't keep.

Catbert: evil director of human resources

 <<<
Excellent idea.

 <<<
Cell phones with cameras are banned from the workplace.
>>>
 <<<
Why?
>>>
 <<<
We don't want you taking pictures of proprietary information.
>>>
 <<<
Most of our information is in digital form and can be e-mailed anywhere.
>>>
 <<<
The rest is on paper that can be copied, scanned or tucked down one's trousers.

My new cell phone will be rendered useless for no good reason!

Is it immoral for my company to sell forty-thousand calorie, shard-filled doughnuts?
>>>
 <<<
You're not forcing anyone to eat them; you're just making them irresistibly delicious.
>>>
 <<<
How's that different?
>>>
 <<<
Bah!
>>>
2004-11-12 * 
<<<
You can't resist the shard-filled ultra-doughnuts even though you know the hazards.
>>>
 <<<
Mmph

Free will is an illusion.  People always choose the perceived path of greatest pleasure.
>>>
 <<<
Now, rationalize your decision, you mindless pink robot!
>>>
 <<<
I'm only having one.
>>>
2004-11-11 * 
<<<
My company is selling gigantic, shard-filled doughnuts with forty thousand calories apiece.
>>>
 <<<
It's based on Dogbert's theory that people are pleasure-seeking morons.
>>>
 <<<
How does it taste?
>>>
 <<<
Delicious!  I have one for you strapped to my car
>>>
2004-11-10 * 
<<<
Our revenue is now double the number of people that our product has killed recently.
>>>
 <<<
Our product costs $80.  Are you saying that each one kills 40 people?
>>>
 <<<
Our customers know the health risks, so technically they're killing themselves.
>>>
 <<<
So technically we aren't scum?
>>>
2004-11-09 * 
<<<
The government says we have to put warning labels on our forty thousand calorie, shard-filled doughnuts product.
>>>
 <<<
How about: 'Warning!  This product will kill you but that's ok because it tastes great!'

It looks like he choked on some sort of warning label.

Whoa!  You can't go looking like that.

This is a nice suit!

Exactly.

Do you think the real issue might be my insecurity?

Well, I wouldn't date you, but that's mostly because of your looks.

You cancelled all vacations but I have non-refundable plane tickets to tahiti.

2004-10-29 * 
There will be no vacations until the project is finished. <<<
It feels as if I am being punished for your inability to properly plan and staff.

I will contact my 800 wedding guests and tell them that my arranged marriage is cancelled.

Thanks.

2004-10-28 *

I know I keep asking you this but could you explain the issue again?

Well, something that you could never comprehend conflicts with something that you'd never understand.

Oh.

Do you mind if I leave early to spend some time with my kids?

2004-10-25 *

Accounting

Can you explain these expense figures?

What?  You have no accomplishments this month???

What did you do for the past three months?
>>>
 <<<
Well, I spent much of that time correcting misconceptions that you gave to our customers.
>>>
 <<<
And I attended meetings with you to keep you from creating additional misconceptions.
>>>
 <<<
I spent a month working on an objective that you forgot to tell me didn't matter.
>>>
 <<<
I flew to the wrong city for a meeting because you confused Houston with Austin.
>>>
 <<<
And I upgraded your home computer so you wouldn't have to pay someone to do it.

Allow me to paraphrase: Blah, blah, blah, you didn't accomplish anything.

Noooo! Ignore me! I don't know anything.

Hmm.

Now Dilbert will explain what went wrong with our projects this year.

 <<<
All of our problems were caused by a woman named Lisa.

Lisa never learned to act aloof and unapproachable. Sometimes she smiles and men she doesn't even know.

Gasp.

 <<<
As you know, 90% of engineers are lonely men.

A permanent line formed outside her cubicle.

The engineers brought her food, gifts and poems that weren't as funny as they'd hoped.

Food, Gifts, Poems (bad).

It's nice to be retired. I'll do a-a-anything I want to do all day long.
>>>
 <<<
I guess you'll be banging your head against a wall today, trying to earn money for the social infrastructure.
>>>
 <<<
Do you ever feel guilty?
>>>
 <<<
Is it a warm, tingly sensation that makes you wag?
>>>
2003-12-08 * 
Wake up and trudge to work!
>>>
2003-12-07 * 
<<<
May I move to one of the empty cubicles?
>>>
 <<<
Those are full-size cubicles; interns get half-size cubicles.
>>>
 <<<
Yes... ordinarily, but there are hundreds of vacant cubicles because of downsizing.
>>>
 <<<
I'm not following you.
>>>
 <<<
They're EMPTY! They will never be occupied. I want to use one.
>>>
 <<<
We don't have the budget to turn a full-size cubicle into a half-size cubicle just for you.
>>>
 <<<
GAAA!!! That's not what I... never mind! Forget it!
>>>
 <<<
Furthermore, I do not believe this is a half-size cubicle.
>>>
2003-12-06 * 
<<<
I've never done this before, but may I have your phone number?
>>>
 <<<
Home phone.. cell phone.. work phone.. home e-mail.... personal web site.
>>>
 <<<
...And if that fax machine is out of paper, try the one down the hall, but leave me a voice mail if you do.
>>>
2003-12-05 * 
You've got a bad case of carpal punchel syndrome.
>>>
2003-12-04 * 
<<<
This apple will remind us of our CORE values: respect, customer service, and teamwork.
>>>
 <<<
The apple's core is the part you throw away.
>>>
 <<<
Not always. Sometimes I accidentally eat it.
>>>
 <<<
Maybe the stem can represent our loyalty to the company.
>>>
2003-12-03 * 
<<<
I recommend that we break into subgroups to create a process for choosing our next meeting time.
>>>
 <<<
Or we could just meet next week at our usual time.
>>>
 <<<
You're a loose canon.
>>>
 <<<
Stop labeling me with hackneyed phrases!
>>>
 <<<
You're a 'cut now, measure later' type.
>>>
2003-12-02 * 
<<<
What?!! According to the paper, we're merging with an evil company that plans to downsize us.
>>>
 <<<
Did they run my quote about how valuable you are?
>>>
2003-12-01 * 
<<<
Catbert, evil director human resources.
>>>
 <<<
We need to tell our employees about the merger.
>>>
 <<<
They'll read it in the news. Why should we do extra work?
>>>
 <<<
Other companies do it. There must be a reason.
>>>
 <<<
Maybe it's a tax thing.
>>>
2003-11-30 * 
<<<
I'd like you to meet Bradley, our new manager of executive compensation.
>>>
 <<<
Bradley's job is to recommend to our board how much to pay company executives such as me.
>>>
 <<<
Bradley is totally objective.
>>>
 <<<
Totally.
>>>
 <<<
That was a world-class observation, so I'll recommend that the company buy you a pony.
>>>
 <<<
...A STRONG pony to carry the huge bags of cash I recommend for you.
>>>
 <<<
Good work, Bradley. I'll recommend to the board that you get a huge raise!
>>>
 <<<
Gaaa!! Stop pretending to have reasons!! Just steal the stupid money!!!
>>>
 <<<
See what I have to deal with every day?
>>>
 <<<
Would an extra month of vacation reduce the sting?
>>>
2003-11-29 * 
Our company is going to make antivirus software. What's that tell you?
>>>
2003-11-28 * 
I edited your document for clarity and sent it out.
>>>
2003-11-27 * 
<<<
I ask all prospective employees this question to test their reasoning.
>>>
 <<<
You have one fox and two chickens that you need to get across a river. You can only take one at a time in the rowboat. The fox will eat the chickens if left alone.
>>>
 <<<
I'd buy livestock insurance, then barbecue the chickens and blame the fox.
>>>
 <<<
Can you start today?
>>>
2003-11-26 * 
Hello. <<<
This is your lawyer.
>>> <<<
Do you mind if I think about you for a few minutes?
>>> <<<
Um... no.

Mmm... $400 an hour.

Wait.. dear lord... noooo!!!

I'm planning to replace myself with cheap Elbonian labor.

Catbert, evil H.R. director.
>>>
 <<<
In order to cut costs, some of you will be relocated to the bottom of the ocean.
>>>
 <<<
Wouldn't we be crushed by the pressure?
>>>
 <<<
Every job has some pressure.
>>>
 <<<
And then there's the breathing issue.
>>>
 <<<
I label you a whiner.
>>>
2003-11-23 * 
<<<
The new batch of job applicants is more desperate than usual.
>>>
 <<<
Excellent.
>>>
 <<<
Five hundred qualified people applied for this position.
>>>
 <<<
Who wants this job the most?
>>>
 <<<
I plan to pummel each applicant with a variety of objects, beginning with very soft items.
>>>
 <<<
Then I'll gradually move toward harder materials until only one person is left.
>>>
 <<<
I'll begin with this soft sugar doughnut.
>>>
 <<<
ZING. PIFF!
>>>
 <<<
Thank you.
>>>
 <<<
How are theur attitudes?
>>>
 <<<
Refreshingly upbeat!
>>>
2003-11-22 * 
Our goal is to do more with less.
>>>
2003-11-21 * 
<<<
Lately I am overcome with doubt that you read my status reports.
>>>
 <<<
Asok, the biggest value of a status report is that it makes you consider all the costs of your project.
>>>
 <<<
Actually, that is the biggest value of a business plan or a budget.
>>>
 <<<
Whatever. Throw it on the pile.
>>>
2003-11-20 * 
I desperately need to take this training.

2003-11-19 *

Welcome to the competitive strategies seminar.

First, some housekeeping. In the event of an emergency, stay seated so I'll have a clear path to the exit.

And... there is no men's room in the building as far as you know.

My vacation was so relaxing that I'm still floating.
>>>
 <<<
Hey, Alice, you know how I promised to cover all of your meetings for two weeks? I forgot until right now.
>>>
 <<<
From floating to furious in 27 seconds. It's a personal best.
>>>
2003-11-16 * 
<<<
Wally, I'm glad we work in the same department.
>>>
 <<<
Because your performance is so bad that you'll be downsized first.
>>>
 <<<
You're like a buffer. As long as you're still here, my job is safe.
>>>
 <<<
And there's nothing you can do to change the situation.
>>>
 <<<
Wally, do you mind giving my family a ride to church again this week?
>>>
 <<<
No problem.
>>>
 <<<
It's nice that you joined my church even though you live an hour away.
>>>
 <<<
And I wouldn't say no to those tasty bagels you always bring for the ride.
>>>
 <<<
GAAA!!!
>>>
 <<<
Oh... I didn't see you sneak up on me, Heathen.. I mean Alice.
>>>
2003-11-15 * 
My project has no progress and no hope for progress.
>>>
2003-11-14 * 
<<<
Wally, can you show me how to make changes to the skills database?
>>>
 <<<
I can't risk being known as the guy who knows how to edit the database.
>>>
 <<<
Because?
>>>
 <<<
I barely have time to avoid the work I already have.
>>>
2003-11-13 * 
Where can I put my most important files so I won't lose them?
>>>
2003-11-12 * 
Later we'll be joined by the director of the only division that's making a profit.
>>>
2003-11-11 * 
<<<
We'll be seeing a lot of each other. I'm a stalker.
>>>
 <<<
I wait by his office, unscheduled, ready to suck up to his whenever his phone calls end.
>>>
 <<<
Please don't go.. it's still out there.
>>>
2003-11-10 * 
Ted is being rude and helpful. Can you ask his boss to remove him from the project?
>>>
2003-11-09 * 
Everyone gets a company shirt! It's good for morale.
>>>
2003-11-08 * 
<<<
I'm having problems at home, so I'll be taking it out on you today.
>>>
 <<<
I'll begin by hallucinating that you said something bad. Then I'll yell at you for saying it.
>>>
 <<<
I AM NOT A SADISTIC NUT!!!

 <<<
If I go to my cubicle, can you hallucinate that I'm here?

Don't sell your new product for $29. Offer it at $1,000,029 with a rebate of $1,000,000.

 <<<
People will think it's a great bargain when in fact it's just a huge inconvenience.
>>>
 <<<
And all we need is one person to forget to mail in the rebate forms.

We'll target the lazy rich.

2003-11-06 *

Bottleneck Bill.

All purchase orders must be approved by me.

I'll be too busy to approve anything, but at least we have a system.
>>>
 <<<
GRRRRR.
>>>
 <<<
It's titanium. Nice try.
>>>
2003-11-05 * 
<<<
I can't do any more work on my project until you give your input, but you're too busy.
>>>
 <<<
There's no polite way to say this: Bill, you're a bottleneck.
>>>
 <<<
Your document is now saying hi to the bottom of the pile.
>>>
2003-11-04 * 
<<<
We're not 'level conscious' here.
>>>
 <<<
You could walk up to any vice president's office and talk to his secretary as if you were an equal.
>>>
 <<<
Which, by the way, you're not. So don't try to make direct eye contact.
>>>
2003-11-03 * 
<<<
Wally, there have been complaints that you take conference calls from the men's room.
>>>
 <<<
Ok, perhaps I have a few idiosyncrasies, but it's only because I care so much about the work.
>>>
 <<<
No one invited you to those conference calls.
>>>
 <<<
What if I've already finished the newspaper?
>>>
2003-11-02 * 
<<<
Wally, what's the status of your project?
>>>
 <<<
Deep breath.. clear my mind...
>>>
 <<<
I've been focusing my bandwidth on organic growth.
>>>
 <<<
I'm getting lots of push-back, so I'm taking the discussions offline.
>>>
 <<<
But sometimes I table an issue or handle it in a side bar.
>>>
 <<<
Now I have my ducks in a row. The deal-breakers are on the back burner, and I'm managing expectations.
>>>
 <<<
Okay... keep up the good work.
>>>
 <<<
Wally, you don't have a project.
>>>
 <<<
What? Then why am I so tired?
>>>
2003-11-01 * 
<<<
Alice, your problem is that you take on too much work.
>>>
 <<<
The problem is that you GIVE me too much work!
>>>
 <<<
Your second problem is that you blame others, and your third problem is that you're always angry.
>>>
 <<<
GAAA!! IT'S ALL YOU!!
>>>
2003-10-31 *

Hey, Rick. Allow me to explain why your specifications are mutually exclusive.
>>>

Must transform.

If we make the package ultra light, there won't be enough material to absorb impact when...

I don't think I'm getting through.
>>>
2003-10-30 *

I e-mailed you the expense breakdown. I need you to fix the format and send it out.

I will now read your mind to get the unspoken, ever-shifting preferences for the format.

The title gives you access to the executive helicopter landing pad on the roof.

Are you going to lunch?

Lunch already?

Sheesh! I barely had time to come late to work, eat breakfast, use the plumbing and read the paper.
>>>
 <<<
You take your non-work seriously.
>>>
 <<<
I'm trying to develop a sense of non-urgency.
>>>
2003-10-26 * 
<<<
I have an idea for boosting my performance.
>>>
 <<<
You wisely coached us to use all of our vacation days every year.
>>>
 <<<
Because we come back recharged!
>>>
 <<<
Our renewed motivation is more than enough to compensate for ths missed days.
>>>
 <<<
My plan is to leverage that competitive advantage.
>>>
 <<<
I'll take a fifteen year vacation and return ten minutes before retirement.
>>>
 <<<
Then I'll be so recharged that I'll pounce and do twenty years of work in minutes!!
>>>
 <<<
Unless it's near a holiday, in which case, do you mind if I leave early?

The 'A' stands for afterlife.

You'll get no money in this life, but the company will reward you in the afterlife.

The odds of that happening seem low.

Yes, but on an expected-value basis, a high potential reward compensates for low odds.

Seventy versions.

Neck.. muscles.. so.. weak.

I think motivation causes that.

I have the results of the employee morale survey.

 <<<
The number one issue is 'not enough open and honest communication from management.'

Well, okay. I'm willing to give that a try.

Management is looting the company while hiding the fact that we're in a death spiral.

Whenever you talk, I think about fishing lures until the noise stops.

When I see an employee suffer, it excites me in ways I don't understand.

Bob, remember that money can't buy happiness.
>>>
 <<<
But it can buy expensive possessions that make other people envious, and that feels just as good.
>>>
 <<<
And you can pay to have people whacked.
>>>
 <<<
Can I trade my happiness for some money?

2003-09-19 * 
<<<
I recommend that we look at the big picture and view it from 20,000 feet.

 <<<
Drifting.. floating above the Earth.. wait.. a plane is coming right at me! NO-O-O-O!!!
>>>
 <<<
Maybe you should imagine you're in the plane.
>>>
 <<<
GAAAA!! I'm in coach!
>>>
2003-09-18 * 
Did you order the plastic casings I need?
>>>
2003-09-17 * 
Would you like to make a hundred million dollars for just showing up at work?
>>>
2003-09-16 * 
<<<
At the India Institute of Technology, I learned to use my huge brain.
>>>
 <<<
But I try not to frighten ordinary people with any gratuitous displays of mental superiority.
>>>
 <<<
For example, I no longer reheat my tea by holding it to my forehead and imagining fire.
>>>
2003-09-15 * 
<<<
Since I became project manager, no one has returned my calls or responded to my e-mails.
>>>
 <<<
Luckily, I'm an I.I.T. graduate, mentally superior to most people on Earth, so I finished the project myself.
>>>
 <<<
Are you tired?
>>>
 <<<
I am trained to only sleep during national holidays.
>>>
2003-09-14 * 
<<<
Asok, I designate you the keeper of the giant binder.
>>>
 <<<
It contains our secret technology plans.
>>>
 <<<
It can never leave this office.
>>>
 <<<
It won't fit in any drawer.
>>>
 <<<
And the 'clean desk policy' forbids me from leaving it on my desktop.
>>>
 <<<
GAAA!! I can't take it home, and I can't leave it here!
>>>
 <<<
I must use it as a tiny bed and spend the rest of my days guarding it.
>>>
 <<<
What did you do with the giant binder prop that you got at the trade show?
>>>
2003-09-13 * 
I've put my heart and soul into the high-speed-data-by-sewer project.
>>>
2003-09-12 * 
<<<
You need to slither away from your doomed project before you get blamed.
>>>
 <<<
My assistant will teach you how to shed your project manager skin.
>>>
 <<<
Yello!
>>>
 <<<
Ow! Ow! Ow! How's this so far?
>>>
 <<<
Impressive, but we were speaking metaphorically.
>>>
2003-09-11 * 
<<<
In only one week my project team has created a time line and identified the resources we need.
>>>
 <<<
Next week, we plan to revise the time line and re-examine our resource needs.
>>>
 <<<
Good work.
>>>
 <<<
There must be a thousand ways to say I haven't done anything.
>>>
 <<<
Wait..
>>>
2003-09-10 * 
<<<
I've never been a project manager before.
>>>
 <<<
I understand I'm supposed to direct your natural talents and energies toward a common goal.
>>>
 <<<
Carol, did you make copies of the agenda?
>>>
 <<<
No, it sounded hard.
>>>
2003-09-09 * 
<<<
Asok, would you like to join a doomed project for sending internet traffic over the sewer system?
>>>
 <<<
Absolutely! I might be young and inexperienced, but I know a good thing when I see it!
>>>
 <<<
I need you to work under the sewage and breathe through a straw.
>>>
 <<<
I get a straw?!!
>>>
2003-09-08 * 
Our competitors found a way to send broadband internet traffic over the power grid.
>>>
2003-09-07 * 
You never responded to my urgent request for engineering resources. <<<
What?
>>> <<<
I told Alice to ask you!
>>> <<<
She must have forgotten.
>>> <<<
I sent you three e-mail messages.
>>> <<<
You know I don't have time to read my e-mail.
>>> <<<
And I sent you a voicemail.
>>> <<<
You know I don't have time for voice-mails.
>>> <<<
That's why I also..
>>> <<<
Tatooed it on your stinkin' chest!!!
>>> <<<
As if I have time to read my torso.
>>>
2003-09-06 * 
<<<
Dilbert, take care of this. It's our top priority.
>>> <<<
Sure. I'll just let m other priorities slip until my career is a smoldering mound of rubble.
>>> <<<
So what is it?
>>> <<<
I don't know.. I just didn't like it on my desk.
>>>
2003-09-05 * 
<<<
Wally, how do I handle the psychological pressure of a stalled career?
>>>
 <<<
Remember that when you reach for the stars, they're too far away, so it's hopeless.
>>>
 <<<
But sometimes you can reach a star.. can't you?
>>>
 <<<
That would burn your hand clean off.

Mike the Vegan.
2003-09-03 * 
<<<
Where do you want to eat?
>>>
 <<<
Anyplace.
>>>
 <<<
Suddenly, Mike, the vegan pounced.
>>>
 <<<
Do you mind if I join you?
>>>
 <<<
Soon, hunger started to set in.
>>>
 <<<
No, I can't eat at any of those fifty choices. What else do you have?
>>>
2003-09-02 * 
<<<
The technical solution is simple and inexpensive.
>>>
 <<<
But it would cost a fortune to get internal approvals because vast herds of management dolts would get involved.
>>>
 <<<
So I should just do it, right?
>>>
 <<<
Did you just call me a vast herd?
>>>
2003-09-01 * 
<<<
Alice, I know that times are tough. But you need to show more optimism.
>>> <<<
Try to find the good thing in any bad situation.
>>> <<<
Our entire sales force has been eaten by wild pigs.

Pigs are cute!

Hi, I'm Matt. It's my first day here.
>>>
 <<<
I'm Dilbert.

 <<<
And this is...

 <<<
I'd rather not say.
>>>
 <<<
I prefer to remain anonymous, so you won't feel comfortable asking me for anything later on.
>>>
 <<<
Here's my card. It's blank.
>>>
 <<<
The phrase that you're least likely to hear today is, 'We're just like family.'
>>>
 <<<
Are you worried that he'll turn over the card and see your name?
>>>
 <<<
No.
>>>
 <<<
Was that MY card?
>>>
 <<<
I've been handing them out for years.
>>>
2003-08-30 * 
My keyboard looks exactly like everyone else's.
>>>
2003-08-29 * 
<<<
Tinkle tinkle tinkle.
>>>
 <<<
Boss approaching.
>>>
 <<<
Thanks for the magic management necklace! I have to admit that I doubted its powers.
>>>
 <<<
But since I've been wearing it, I haven't seen a single employee who wasn't hard at work.
>>>
2003-08-28 * 
<<<
I have a PHD, so obviously you should do what I say.
>>>
 <<<
Instead of negotiating with vendors, let's just tell them how much money we have and ask them to do the right thing.
>>>
 <<<
You're probably feeling embarrassed for not thinking of the idea yourself.
>>>
 <<<
Must..not..shave..PHD.
>>>
2003-08-27 * 
<<<
Wow! You have three masters degrees and a PHD!
>>>
 <<<
Yes, it's all very impressive, but interestingly, I have no common sense whatsoever.
>>>
 <<<
That's not the sort of thing you should say during a job interview.
>>>
 <<<
I don't see why not.
>>>
2003-08-26 * 
<<<
Our new product has half a million lines of code!
>>>
 <<<
Translation: there's nothing good about this product, so you hope I'm impressed by irrelevant data.
>>>
 <<<
Now available in ecru!
>>>
 <<<
You leave me no choice but to key your car on the way out.
>>>
2003-08-25 * 
<<<
I'll get everyone's opinion, and then I'll make my decision.
>>>
 <<<
Translation: you'll take the advice of whoever does the best job of trash-talking everyone else.
>>>
 <<<
Where do you get these crazy ideas?
>>>
 <<<
She's mental.
>>>
2003-08-24 * 
<<<
When I'm not helping team members, I like to feed the poor or read to blind people.
>>>
 <<<
I don't care about money. All I want is a chance to help humanity reach its fullest potential.
>>>
 <<<
You're so wonderful. It's making me cry! You're hired.
>>>
 <<<
Excellent.
>>>
 <<<
Come meet the team.
>>>
 <<<
I have a special skill for identifying good people.
>>>
 <<<
It's part instinct, part experience.
>>>
 <<<
And yes, maybe just a little ESP.
>>>
 <<<
Watch this.
>>>
 <<<
Alice, your favorite color is...mitten?
>>>
2003-08-23 * 
<<<
Alice, I notice that you always click something when I approach.
>>>
 <<<
Obviously you've been using company time to look at indescribably filthy images.
>>>
 <<<
And why does that seem so obvious to you?
>>>
 <<<
Let's leave me out of this.
>>>
2003-08-22 * 
<<<
Lately, every person I deal with seems to disappoint me.
>>> <<<
Every meeting starts late, every answer is misleading, every deadline is ignored, and all work is shoddily done.
>>> <<<
I guess what I'm saying is that today I need some empathy.
>>> <<<
You are totally blocking my view of the wall.
>>>
2003-08-21 * 
Someone named Tiffany sent me e-mail.
>>>
2003-08-20 * 
<<<
And you failed at your primary objective of winning a bid for the galatikus job.
>>> <<<
That's because you said you'd deliver the bid on time, but you got seduced by Irish line-dancing lessons and forgot to mail it!
>>> <<<
I can't believe you're trying to pin the blame on the Irish.
>>>
2003-08-19 * 
<<<
After months of work, I finished our bid for the huge galatikus project.
>>>
 <<<
I'll deliver it to them.
>>>
 <<<
If it's on minute late, we'll be disqualified. The future of our company depends on us winning this bid.
>>>
 <<<
He must think I'm a... Whoa, what's this?

 <<<
Irish line dancing lessons 10% off.

2003-08-18 *

I'm trying to fire a guy who has multiple personalities.

I'm exhausted. I fired the cowboy, the little girl, and the astronaut this morning. I'll do the twins later this afternoon.
>>>

I'm tired, but it's a good tired.
>>>
 <<<
Can I do the mime?

2003-08-17 * 
<<<
Dogbert Consults.
>>>
 <<<
Your network-security product is buggy and complicated.
>>> <<<
Your used guide is an inspired work of pure evil.
>>>
 <<<
And your tech-support department is an inebriated chimpanzee with a typewriter.
>>>
 <<<
One strategy would be to fix all of those problems.
>>>
 <<<
What's the other strategy?
>>>
 <<<
Sell consulting services to your victims... I mean customers!
>>>
 <<<
I'm so happy, it's making my hair quiver!
>>>
 <<<
But what do we do when our consultants can't make our products work either?
>>>
 <<<
They're paid by the hour.
>>>
 <<<
QUIVER!!

2003-08-16 * 
<<<
The man who couldn't give direct answers.
>>>
 <<<
Did you ask your boss for approval?
>>>
 <<<
Now i will explain the process for getting approval.
>>>
 <<<
Do you want to do this the hard way?
>>>
 <<<
First, you ask for a meeting.
>>>
2003-08-15 * 
<<<
We can either wait three months for the software committee to approve our plan...
>>>
 <<<
Or we can soar like eagles, and act without approval, saving millions of dollars!
>>>
 <<<
Please don't be sidetracked by the analogy.
>>>
 <<<
Since when do eagles use software?
>>>
2003-08-14 * 
<<<
Alice, this year you single-handedly designed and launched a billion dollar line of new products.
>>>
 <<<
For that accomplishment, I give you the highly coveted 'meets expectations' designation!
>>>
 <<<
Alice, if having high expectations of you is wrong, then I don't want to be right.
>>>
2003-08-13 * 
<<<
Our legal department advises us to destroy any documents that show we know our products are hugely defective.

CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP, CHEW, CHEW, GULP.

Do you have room in there for the user specifications?

2003-08-12 * 
What is the priority of your budget request?

2003-08-11 * 
<<<
Now I'd like to recognize Walter for his five years of work for this company.
>>>
 <<<
Thanks, but I've been here for thirty years.. Oh, I get it now.
>>>
 <<<
I feel a sick day coming on.
>>>
2003-08-10 * 
<<<
Wally, why have you been charging all of your hours to my project?
>>>
 <<<
I invited you to one meeting. It lasted one hour.
>>>
 <<<
Do you think I would go to a meeting without extensive preparation?
>>>
 <<<
Okay.. that's another hour.
>>>
 <<<
How many more do you need explained?
>>>
 <<<
Fifty-eight.
>>>
 <<<
After the meeting, I sat quietly and evaluated what everyone said. That took fity-seven hours.
>>>
 <<<
Ha! You're still an hour short. Explain THAT!
>>>
 <<<
Do you mind if I sit quietly and think about that question for a while?
>>>
2003-08-09 * 
<<<
That concludes my two-hour presentation. Any questions?
>>>
 <<<
Did you intend the presentation to be incomprehenisble, or do you have some sort of rare 'powerpoint' disability.
>>>
 <<<
Are there any questions about the content?
>>>
 <<<
There was content?
>>>
2003-08-08 * 
<<<
The weather is getting worse. Maybe we should close the office.
>>>
 <<<
No.
>>>
 <<<
The forecast is blizzards, freezing rain, tsunamis, deadly lava flows, and precision-guided ball lightning.
>>>
 <<<
And radiation enlarged swarms of killer bees.

Get some snow tires, you big baby.

2003-08-07 * 
Tell me why you need a new server.
>>>
2003-08-06 * 
<<<
I need a description of your project and its projected cost.
>>>
 <<<
That's impossible.
>>>
 <<<
The project uncertainty principle says that if you understand a project, you won't know its cost, and vice versa.
>>>
 <<<
You just made that up.
>>>
 <<<
That doesn't make it wrong.
>>>
2003-08-05 *

I'm trying to make him lose his language skills.

I've been using words in the wrong context and waiting for him to adopt them.

Carol, could you truculent this doctrinaire to the obelisk?
>>>
 <<<
Cervically.
>>>
2003-08-04 * 
<<<
Tina, we need some customer success stories for the web site.
>>>
 <<<
The closest things we have are these complaint letters. Just change a few words.
>>>
 <<<
Change 'kick' to 'kiss' and this one is done, albeit disturbingly.
>>>
2003-08-03 * 
<<<
I have some disturbing news.
>>>
 <<<
We outsourced our customer-service function to India a few years ago.
>>>
 <<<
So?
>>>
 <<<
Apparently, they subcontracted the job to Mexico.
>>>
 <<<
Then Mexico subcontracted to Vietnam, who subcontracted to the Philippines..
>>>
 <<<
..Who subcontracted it to us.
>>>
 <<<
It turns out that we're the lowest-cost provider because we lie about our hold times.
>>>
 <<<
In summary, we pay ourselves to hose ourselves.
>>>
 <<<
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
>>>
 <<<
We should raise our prices?
>>>
2003-08-02 * 
<<<
Our goal is nothing less than a complete takeover of pointy-haired Carl's software division.
>>>
 <<<
We'll start secretly doing their jobs in addition to our own. Then I'll argue that they should report to me.
>>>
 <<<
Hypothetically, if the secret got out, would we stop working twice as hard for no extra money?
>>>
2003-08-01 * 
<<<
This is my nemesis, pointy-haired Carl.  He manages our software division.
>>> <<<
Write up some reasons why he should report to me. I'll secretly give it to our Vice President.
>>>  <<<
Start by saying there's no real difference between hardware and software.
>>>
 <<<
I'm unclean!
>>>
2003-07-31 * 
I've decided to spend more time criticizing things I don't understand.

No, I'm telling you to absorb his function.. in an absorptive fashion.

Can you change reality by inventing new names for ordinary things?

You're the only one who hasn't finished the mandatory online six sigma training.

I finished it, but the system crashed before it stored my data.

This is when you say, 'There's no need to retake the training. I'll just check off your name.'

Are you new on this planet?

2003-07-21 * 
<<<
I've noticed that deadd people know a lot. They're always yapping to psychics on television.

We could kill the entire software-testing staff and replace them with one medium.

Do you see any problem with that?

If the dead people lie, how would we punish them?

Dilbert points to a slide and says, <<<
As requested, I put together a list of functions we should outsource.

I limited my list to things we don't do well.

Marketing, quality control, engineering, finance, human resources, and customer support.

That leaves us with our core competence...

... Sitting around a brown table.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
And, of course, our ability to speak honestly without fear of retribution.

You will never get another raise as long as I'm alive.

>>> The man behind the hotel counter looks like a skeleton and has a rat on his head. The man says, <<<
What kind of fleas do you want in your mattress?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Lazy ones.
>>> 
2002-09-16 * 
Dilbert is at the airport. The Elbonian at the ticket counter of Elbonia Air says, <<<
I don't see your reservation.
>>> The Elbonian continues, <<<
Maybe it's because all of our computers are cardboard props that we stole from a furniture store.
>>> The Elbonian holds gloves out towards Dilbert and says, <<<
For security purposes, would you care to frisk me?
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
Yes.
>>> 
2002-09-15 * 
Dilbert hands The Boss a piece of paper and says, <<<
I completed the feasibility analysis.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
It would take us two years to build a product that will be obsolete one year from now.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Okay, let's get started.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Um.. No, the point is project can't succeed.
>>> The Boss responds, <<<
We want people to think we're developing this sort of product, so we'll be credible in the market.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So our plan is to do stupid things until we appear credible?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Exactly!
>>> Dilbert walks away and exclaims, <<<
Gaaa!! My life is a complete waste!!
>>> The Boss says to Catbert, <<<
Tomorrow I'll ask him why he's behind schedule.
>>> Catbert responds, <<<
Very evil. Nicely done.
>>> 
2002-09-14 * 
Dilbert is still in a barrel. The Boss says to him, <<<
I'm sending you to Elbonia for a meeting, but we're on a tight budget.
>>> The Boss, also in a barrel, continues, <<<
So there will be no limo service to the airport. Go there in the cheapest way possible.
>>> A bear rolls Dilbert in his barrel down the highway. The bear says, <<<
And then I started Brownie's Barrel Service.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
He's a talker.
>>> 
2002-09-13 * 
The Boss and Dilbert are still in barrels. The Boss says, <<<
Set up a meeting with the customer so we can demonstrate our technology.
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
It's humiliating because we're so poor now. What will I feed them?
>>> Dilbert pours cat food into bowls for the customers. He says, <<<
If you think the food is great, wait until you see our technology!
>>> 
2002-09-12 * 
The Boss is standing naked, in a barrel. He says to Carol, <<<
To remind us all of our need to reduce expenses, the new dress code is barrels.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Except for Friday, which will be casual barrel day.
>>> Wally, The Boss, and Dilbert are sitting with their arms up and barrels hiding their heads. Dilbert says, <<<
Has anyone else noticed that the barrel rides up with you sit?
>>> 
2002-09-11 * 
Dilbert is at home and still has his wrists bound. He says to Dogbert, <<<
Then our new CEO backed up a moving van to the building and robbed us.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
At first we thought he was breaking the law, but he had a written opinion from his tax lawyer saying it was probably okay.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
What did the board of directors do?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
After loading the van?
>>> 
2002-09-10 * 
Dilbert has his wrists stuck together and Wally is bound in duct tape. Dilbert says, <<<
I like our new CEO. He has charisma.
>>> Wally replies, <<<
The man sure knows how to rob. He's a miracle worker with duct tape.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
He even gave me back my emptied wallet.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Classy move.
>>> 
2002-09-09 * 
The Boss introduces a man outfitted in a burglar suit, holding a sack. The Boss says, <<<
This is our new CEO, Rufus T. Skwerrel. His first job was trailer park burglar. The Boss continues, <<<
But thanks to a series of mergers and acquisitions, not to mention suspicious accounting, here we are.
>>> The Boss asks Rufus, <<<
Would you like to say a few words?
>>> Rufus pulls a knife out on Asok and says, <<<
Wallet and watch.
>>> 
2002-09-08 * 
The Boss approaches Carol and says, <<<
Carol, cancel all of my meetings forever.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
From now on, I plan to stay in my office and manage by e-  mail.
>>> Carol responds, <<<
You still need to communicate some things in person.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
No, I don't. I can do it all by e-mail.
>>> The Boss types, <<<
Carol, e-mail me the budget.
>>> He hits <<<
Send.
>>> The Boss sits back and thinks, <<<
And now, like magic..
>>> The computer alerts, <<<
You have 1 message.
>>> The e-mail reads, <<<
Auto-reply: Carol is out of the office.
>>> The Boss looks out and sees Carol at her desk. Carol waves. The Boss thinks, <<<
We have a situation here.
>>> 
2002-09-07 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert and Alice, <<<
Our survey of customer satisfaction shows improvement.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
The focus group spontaneously attacked our researchers using number two pencils as shivs.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
That's an improvement?
>>> The Boss responds, <<<
Last year the attack was premeditated.
>>> 
2002-09-06 * 
Headline: <<<
Mouse Training. The instructor says, <<<
Today you will learn how to avoid premature clickage.
>>> The instructor continues, <<<
Contort your face and visualize what you look like with a contorted face.

Now pair off and we'll do some finger exercises that I call 'The Three Stooges.'
>>> 
2002-09-05 * 
Headline: <<<
Mouse training. The instructor asks the class, <<<
Who wants to share an opinion on why mouse training is important?
>>> Wally raises his hand enthusiastically and says, <<<
Ooh-ooh! Pick me!
>>> The instructor says, <<<
Yes, Wally.
>>> Wally responds, <<<
No one?
>>> 
2002-09-04 * 
Dilbert is sitting at his computer. Tina approaches and says, <<<
I'm signing up people for the mandatory mouse training club.
>>> Tina continues, <<<
I see you're using a Western grip. That's just begging for carpal tunnel.
>>> Tina grabs Dilbert's wrist and says, <<<
Weak muscles... I'll put you in the two- handed mouse class.
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
Ouch.
>>> 
2002-09-03 * 
Dilbert comes home and says to Dogbert, <<<
Today I realized I hate everyone in the entire world.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I used to think I might like some people I hadn't met. But now I think they're weasels too.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
How about a wide-eyed and innocent child who loves you unconditionally?
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
Tiny weasels.
>>> 
2002-09-02 * 
Dilbert says to a coworker, <<<
And I need a code for charging my project's expenses.
>>> The coworker says, <<<
No. I hate your project.
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
It doesn't matter if you hate it. You're just the guy who assigns codes.
>>> The coworker motions to the door and says, <<<
Get out of here.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why is everything in this company so freakin' hard?
>>> The coworker replies, <<<
Because of people like you.
>>> 
2002-09-01 * 
The Boss addresses a meeting, <<<
Welcome to my quarterly employee feedback meeting.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Who wants to get the ball rolling?
>>> Asok raises his hand. Asok says, <<<
It would be helpful if you told us our company's long term strategy.
>>> The Boss responds, <<<
Oh, would it?
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Why? So you can leak it to our competitors?
>>> The Boss stands and yells, <<<
Here's your stupid suggestion in my hand! I'm crushing it! Crush, crush, crush!!!!
>>> The Boss pretends to stuff something in his mouth and yells, <<<
Now I'll chew it up so I can spit it in your cubicle-dwelling face!!!
>>> As they're walking out, Wally says to Asok, <<<
You fell for that trap last quarter too.
>>> Asok replies, <<<
An optimist's life is never easy.
>>> 
2002-08-31 * 
The Bullysaur says to Bob, <<<
Hello, Bob. I hear you're evolving a zit into a third eye, trying to get an advantage.
>>> Bob responds, <<<
Gaaa!! No, it's only for cosmetic reasons, I swear!!
>>> The Bullysaur mutters, <<<
Hmm...
>>> Dogbert and Dilbert are on the couch. Bob's voice is heard, <<<
Gaaa!!
>>> Dogbert asks Dilbert, <<<
Wanna watch a dinosaur be forced to use topical antibiotics?
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
No, I have 'TIVO.'
>>> 
2002-08-30 * 
Bob says to Dogbert, <<<
I plan to use punctuated equilibrium to turn this zit into a third eye.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
That's not a natural advantage. You'd better stay away from the fitter dinosaurs.
>>> Bob says, <<<
Ha ha! My only enemies are Bullysaurs and they...
>>> A Bullysaur sneaks up behind Bob and calls out, <<<
Hey, zit eye!
>>> 
2002-08-29 * 
Dilbert says to Bob the Dinosaur, <<<
Hi, Bob. I haven't seen you lately.
>>> Bob responds, <<<
I was doing some evolving.
>>> Dilbert and Bob are sitting at the kitchen table. Bob says, <<<
I noticed that I have a zit that's sensitive to sunlight. I'm hoping it becomes an eye.
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
I like your attitude.
>>> Bob says, <<<
Try to sneak up on me.
>>> 
2002-08-28 * 
An employee comes into The Boss' office and says, <<<
Ha ha! I quit you stinkin' pile of rubbish!
>>> The employee continues, <<<
I'm going to work for myself. I won't need to deal with morons like you again!
>>> The employee calms down and adds, <<<
On an unrelated note, if you need a freelance web designer, please call me.
>>> 
2002-08-27 * 
The Boss says to Wally and Dilbert, <<<
I found or five-year plan from five years ago.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
The last page says, <<<
At the end of the fifth year, the entire management team will be...
>>> The Boss continues to read, <<<
... investigated for accounting irregularities.
>>> Wally looks at the secret service agent who has just entered and says, <<<
Spooky.
>>> 
2002-08-26 * 
The Boss pulls a file out of his drawer and thinks, <<<
What's this? It's our old five- year plan!
>>> He opens the file and thinks, <<<
I wonder how we did compared to the plan.
>>> The Boss approaches Dilbert and asks, <<<
Have we relegated Microsoft to the dust heap of history?

Shhh! They might hear!

2002-08-25 * 
Alice is sitting at her computer. The Boss approaches and says, <<<
Make the box bluer.

A little more.. A little more... A little more..
>>> Alice interrupts, <<<
That's it!!
>>> Alice opens her drawer and exclaims, <<<
When you get tired of micromanaging me...
>>> Alice hands The Boss a cup of blood and continues, <<<
Put this sample of my blood under a microscope so you can manage me on a cellular level.
>>> Alice continues yelling, <<<
And here's a book by Erwin Schrodinger in case you'd like to manage me on a quantum level!
>>> Alice screams, <<<
Do you understand what I'm saying?
>>> The Boss walks out carrying the blood sample and book. He thinks, <<<
Free gifts.

Now I want all of you white blood cells to spell 'Hi.'
>>> 
2002-08-24 * 
Dilbert says into the phone, <<<
And I need the software in a week.
>>> The voice on the other end of the line says, <<<
Cheryl is the only one who knows the ordering system.
>>> The woman on the other end of the line says into the phone, <<<
She's on her honeymoon for two weeks. You need CFO approval to buy software outside the system.
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
Fine. I'll talk to the CFO. When will he be available?
>>> The voice responds, <<<
Depends on the parole board.
>>> 
2002-08-23 * 
Wally says to The Boss and Dilbert, <<<
My morale sky-rocketed when I received my first-ever item of bulk mail.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
I have designated it 'WM1' for 'Wally's Mail One' and it shall remain forever unopened. The Boss says, <<<
Bulk mail is the same as junk mail.
>>> Wally says to the letter, <<<
Don't listen to his lies, WM1.
>>> 
2002-08-22 * 
Wally is holding his letter up to the light. Dilbert says, <<<
I've never seen anyone get this excited over a piece of junk mail.
>>> Wally responds, <<<
I've never been on a mailing list before. This letter is a validation of my existence.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's not addressed to you.
>>> Wally replies, <<<
I'll grant you that it's not a clean win.
>>> 
2002-08-21 * 
Wally and Dilbert are in the mail room. Wally says, <<<
I have mail! I've never had mail in twelve years here.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
It's not addressed to me but it was in my box so I'm keeping it.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
No mail for twelve years?

If I hold it just right it glistens.
>>> 
2002-08-20 * 
The Boss approaches Carol at her desk and says, <<<
Carol, I'm sending you to an executive bodyguard class.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
You'll learn how to pounce on a kidnapper and sacrifice yourself to keep me safe.

I'm taking a class called, 'inside help.'
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I can't reimburse for that.
>>> 
2002-08-19 * 
Asok says to The Boss and Alice, <<<
Sweet mother of potatoes! I just thought of a billion-dollar idea!!
>>> The Boss responds, <<<
The company owns all of your ideas. Cough it up or I'll fire you and then sue you.
>>> Asok and Alice are walking together. Asok cries, <<<
Waaa!
>>> Alice says, <<<
Your first billion-dollar idea is always the hardest.
>>> 
2002-08-18 * 
Dilbert, Dogbert, and a woman are walking outside. The woman says, <<<
My pet peeve is when people use their cell phones in restaurants.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why? Do they talk louder than the other people in the restaurant?
>>> The woman responds, <<<
No. It's just rude.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Who decides what is rude? Is there a committee?
>>> The woman responds, <<<
It's common sense. You're not supposed to talk into electronic gadgets at a restaurant.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What about a drive-through place? Is it okay to order your food using the microphone?
>>> The woman is visibly frustrated. Dogbert answers his cell phone, <<<
Yello.
>>> Dogbert says into his cell phone, <<<
Hi, Ratbert... Yeh, he made the mistake of talking... The goodnight kiss is a definite no-go.
>>> Dogbert continues into the phone, <<<
No, it's not awkward, but thanks for asking.
>>> 
2002-08-17 * 
Dilbert and his mom are watching television. Dilbert says, <<<
Mom, here's our new commercial.
>>> Dilbert's mom replies, <<<
It gives no information about your products. Are you ashamed or just massively incompetent?
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why can't we be both?
>>> Dilbert's mom responds, <<<
I was just making conversation.
>>> 
2002-08-16 * 
The advertising executive holds up a drawing in front of The Boss and Dilbert. He says, <<<
Your print ads would look like this. It's a shape with no text.
>>> The advertising executive continues, <<<
I did some checking and found out that all the good ideas have been used. This is all that's left.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Can it be green?
>>> The advertising executive responds, <<<
Whoa! Who's the creative person here?
>>> 
2002-08-15 * 
The Boss addresses a meeting, <<<
I hired the 'Amorphous Ad Company' to do our campaign.
>>> The advertising executive says, <<<
I see a gaseous cloud and some music... No, just a noise.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Excellent.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
And then we say the name of our company?
>>> The advertising executive replies, <<<
Sure, if you want to ruin the ad.
>>> 
2002-08-14 * 
Dogbert reports to The Boss, <<<
I've analyzed your corporate culture and put my findings in this report.
>>> The Boss reads the report aloud, <<<
The employees are a bunch of unmotivated weasels. I look good in this hat.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I would have mentioned my knapsack but it's only a summary.
>>> 
2002-08-13 * 
Dogbert observes Alice and records, <<<
The females of the group do all the hunting. The one I call Alice stalks her prey.
>>> Alice is angrily typing an email, <<<
Grrrrr.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
She pounces. Her razor-sharp words tear the prey to shreds.
>>> In another cubicle, a coworker has been burnt and is emitting smoke. Other coworkers lean over the cubicle wall and laugh. Dogbert thinks, <<<
The results are gruesome.  Only the hyenas are laughing.
>>> 
2002-08-12 * 
Dogbert is standing on The Boss' desk wearing a hat, a backpack, and holding a stick. Dogbert says, <<<
I will study the culture in your company and make detailed recommendations.
>>> Dogbert observes Wally and records, <<<
The one I call Wally is a docile outcast who eats bananas and drinks brown water.
>>> Dogbert asks Wally, <<<
Do you mind if I staple this tracking device to your ear?
>>> Wally responds, <<<
Not really.
>>> 
2002-08-11 * 
Dilbert says to The Boss, <<<
Both plans are technically impossible.
>>> The Boss responds, <<<
Which one costs less?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Um... I don't see how that matters, but plan one is cheaper.
>>> The Boss reports to his manager, <<<
Plan one is the best.
>>> The manager responds, <<<
I'll take it to our V.P.
>>> The manager is meeting with an associate. The associate says, <<<
I like plan two.
>>> The manager replies, <<<
Great minds think alike!
>>> The associate approaches the V.P. The V.P. says, <<<
Excellent. Ask one of our engineers to present plan two to the board.
>>> The Boss approaches Dilbert and says, <<<
Guess what.
>>> Dilbert says to Wally, <<<
Every day I make the world a little bit worse.
>>> Wally responds, <<<
What's it like to make a difference?
>>> 
2002-08-10 * 
Dilbert, Allen, and Wally are eating lunch. Allen says, <<<
I telecommuted for four years without knowing until today that I'd been fired.
>>> Allen continues, <<<
Apparently unemployment feels exactly like empowerment.
>>> Allen continues, <<<
This is just like that movie, 'The Sixth Sense.' Did you like that movie, Wally?... Wally?
>>> 
2002-08-09 * 
The Boss turns to an employee and asks, <<<
Who are you?
>>> The employee responds, <<<
I'm Allen. I've been telecommuting for four years.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Allen? I fired you four years ago. Didn't you get my e-mail?

>>> Allen and Dilbert are walking. Allen says to Dilbert, <<<
This is exactly why I stopped coming to the office.
>>> 
2002-08-08 * 

The Boss addresses a meeting, <<<
We have too many empty cubicles. It frightens our customers.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Each of you will adopt an empty cubicle and decorate it to appear occupied.
>>> Wally and Dilbert are walking out. Wally says, <<<
My imaginary employee will be a Frenchman named Phil de Cube.
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
Nice.
>>> 
2002-08-07 * 
Catbert enters Alice's cubicle and says, <<<
Alice, employees are not allowed to eat in cubicles.
>>> Alice stuffs the food in her mouth, <<<
Chomp chomp chomp
>>> Catbert exclaims, <<<
I'm going to see that every time I close my eyes!
>>> Alice responds, <<<
You started it.
>>> 
2002-08-06 * 
An employee asks Carol, <<<
May I use your three-hole punch?
>>> Carol waves her hand and exclaims, <<<
Whoa Whoa Whoa!
>>> Carol says, <<<
You can't come waltzing into this department, using our stuff and leaving your holes.
>>> The employee says, <<<
I'll clean up the holes.
>>> Carol hands him a piece of paper, <<<
I want you to whack the people on this list.
>>> 
2002-08-05 * 
Catbert is sitting on The Boss' desk. Catbert says to The Boss, <<<
I'm tired of calling the employees 'Resources.' It's too complimentary.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
I'm thinking of something along the lines of livestock or human capital.
>>> The Boss responds, <<<
I don't want them demanding hay.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Good point. We'll go with human capital.
>>> 
2002-08-04 * 
Alice addresses a meeting, <<<
If there are no objections, I'd like to start the meeting with a prayer.
>>> Asok starts, <<<
I'm a....
>>> Alice prays, <<<
Yea, though I walk through the valley of idiots, I shall fear no downsizing.
>>> Asok starts, <<<
But I'm...
>>> Alice continues praying, <<<
For I have a fist of death and highly marketable job skills.
>>> Alice continues praying, <<<
But my investment portfolio isn't doing as well as I'd hoped.
>>> Alice continues praying, <<<
So, if it's not too much to ask...
>>> Alice continues praying, <<<
I need a higher return so I can escape these clowns.
>>> Alice exclaims, <<<
And live in splendor while they stew in their own bile!
>>> After the prayer, The Boss responds, <<<
Maybe we won't do this again.
>>> Alice responds, <<<
Whatever you say, heathen.
>>> 
2002-08-03 * 
Wally lies on a psychologist's couch and says, <<<
I can't stop dreaming about work.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
And I usually sleep at work, so I'm dreaming about sleeping and it's freaking me out.
>>> The therapist asks, <<<
Have you considered doing work?
>>> Wally responds, <<<
I want pills. You Quack.
>>> 
2002-08-02 * 
Dilbert reports to The Boss, <<<
Our budget cuts are affecting customer service.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
How much?
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Our customer service center spends all day making prank calls to the elderly.
>>> A customer service representative says into the phone, <<<
According to our records, your neighbor has treasure buried under his lawn.
>>> 
2002-08-01 * 
The Boss addresses a meeting, <<<
Starting today, our goals will be replaced by stretch goals.
>>> Asok asks, <<<
Stretch goals?
>>> Alice says, <<<
Stretch goals are like stretch pants. It's a way of signaling surrender.
>>> Asok puts up both arms in surrender. Alice says, <<<
Speaking of which, I wouldn't say no to a doughnut.
>>> 
2002-07-31 * 
Dilbert approaches a markedly disheveled coworker and asks, <<<
How's your new baby?
>>> The coworker responds, <<<
Wonderful, but the lack of sleep is taking a toll on my body.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How's Becky doing?
>>> The coworker responds, <<<
I AM Becky. Bob looks worse.
>>> 
2002-07-30 * 
Wally says to The Boss, <<<
Over the past year, most of my coworkers have managed expensive projects that failed.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
I've done nothing but drink coffee. So on an economic basis, that makes me your top performer.
>>> Wally takes a sip of coffee and says, <<<
Watch and learn.
>>> 
2002-07-29 * 
Dilbert is sitting at his computer. A female coworker approaches and asks, <<<
Do you think I should inject a deadly poison in my face to hide wrinkles?
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
It's only fair that you poison your face, because your face is killing me. Hee Hee Hee!
>>> The coworker says, <<<
The correct answer is 'You don't need to.'" Dilbert replies, <<<
Was your mother a shar-pei?
>>> 
2002-07-28 * 
Dilbert is at the checkout line of a supermarket. The cashier asks him, <<<
Are you a member of our frequent grocery club?
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
No, what is it?
>>> The cashier replies, <<<
You get a membership card that entitles you to discounts.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Let's see if I have this straight...
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I'll be inconvenienced by having to fill out a form and carry your stupid card around...
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
And in return, you'll put me on a junk mail list, and charge me the same as the grocery store across the street?
>>> Dilbert yells, <<<
AND YOU EXPECT ME TO BE HAPPY ABOUT IT?!!
>>> The customer in line behind Dilbert says, <<<
But it's free!
>>> The cashier says into the intercom, <<<
Cleanup on register two.. it's engineer spittle.
>>> 
2002-07-27 *

I need your help yelling at a guy to make him do his job.

You worthless, incompetent bug!!! I'll have your head!!!

How much work did that buy?

Two phone calls and a meeting.

A coworker is sitting at his computer. Dilbert asks him, <<<
Did you finish the vendor comparison that you promised you'd give me today?

No.
>>> The coworker says, <<<
I'm one of those people that needs to be threatened every day or I won't do anything.

You're very defective.
>>> The coworker responds, <<<
Good start. I'm beginning to feel something.

2002-07-25 * 
Carol enters The Boss' office and says, <<<
The feng shui in your office is terrible.

It is?
>>> Carol says, <<<
That hum... it's the sound of your energy being drained into the internet.
>>> Dilbert asks Carol, <<<
Who told him that his computer fan is killing him?
>>> 
2002-07-24 * 
The Boss says to Wally and Dilbert, <<<
The government is giving us a bailout loan because we have excellent lobbyists!

Ha ha! Taxpayers will give us money so we can build overpriced products to sell to taxpayers!

Remind me again why any of this is legal.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Wuss.
>>> 
2002-07-23 *

This is a list of our executives who sold stock before announcing  bankruptcy.

My plan is to bring each executive to the roof, hold him by the ankles, and shake.

Ooh! A cat comb!

2002-07-22 * 
Wally is sitting at his computer. Alice approaches and says, <<<
Wally, what are we going to do now that we're bankrupt and our 401k money is gone?

Why do you still come to work?
>>> Wally responds, <<<
I don't know how to make coffee.
>>> 
2002-07-21 * 
Wally addresses a meeting, <<<
Now for the highlight of the staff meeting: The Wally Report.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Yesterday I was getting my hair styled as usual.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
But this time I forgot to remove my glasses, and what I saw was disturbing.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
The stylist was using a nose-hair trimmer to cut my hair!
>>> Wally continues, <<<
I protested. But she said she's been doing my hair that way for years.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
She said it just, 'seemed right.'
>>> Wally raises his arms and exclaims, <<<
Tempers flared. I threw some hair gel. A salon brawl broke out!
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Don't we use the same stylist?
>>> Wally replies, <<<
That would explain why she has a plunger.

Dilbert says to his mom, <<<
Our accountants are weasels. They let us go bankrupt so they could sell T-shirts that say, 'I'm with bankrupt.'
>>> Dilbert's mom responds, <<<
Didn't your company make all of its money selling products you know were defective?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Just stir your cauldron, mom.
>>> Dilbert's mom says, <<<
Ironically we're having weasel soup.

2002-07-19 * 
Dilbert says to The Boss, <<<
How could our accounting firm not notice that we were heading for bankruptcy?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Maybe there was a conflict of interest with their T-shirt design business.
>>> Dogbert holds up a T-shirt in front of Ratbert and says, <<<
This one says, 'I'm with bankrupt' and it has an arrow.
>>> Ratbert replies, <<<
Hee Hee!

2002-07-18 * 
Dilbert comes home and says to Dogbert, <<<
I'm broke. The company declared bankruptcy and my 401k savings are worthless.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
No, I've been impersonating you and diversifying your investments into tobacco, sweat shops, and diamond mines.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Really?! How am I doing?
>>> Dogbert responds, <<<
It's mixed. You have a 37&#037; return but your soul will burn for eternity.
>>> 
2002-07-17 * 
Alice says to The Boss, <<<
You made a fortune selling your stock options last month and now we're bankrupt.
>>> Alice continues, <<<
My 401l is worthless. So, in effect, you've stolen my life savings.
>>> Alice yells, <<<
This would be a bad time to make quote marks in the air while saying, 'in effect.'" The Boss has his hands raised to make quote marks. He stops and says, <<<
Ooh.
>>> 
2002-07-16 * 
The Boss says to Alice and Dilbert, <<<
Ha ha! We're filing for chapter 11 because all of our so-called profits are fake.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I'm laughing because I sold all of my stock the same day I heard that our CFO did.
>>> Alice shuts her eyes and clenches her teeth in anger. Alice stands up and yells, <<<
 You said he was just diversifying his investments!
>>> The Boss responds, <<<
 It sounds funny now.

2002-07-15 * 
Catbert says to Tina, <<<
Tina, our records show that you forward an average of nineteen e-mail jokes per week.

Each joke goes to 30,000 employees, costing us ten million per year in lost productivity.

We plan to blame you when we file for bankruptcy next week.

A woman says into the phone, <<<
I'll get to your application as soon as I have nothing more important to do.

Okay.. thank you very much.
>>> Dilbert hangs up the phone and thinks, <<<
I just thanked someone for doing nothing.
>>> Dilbert enters The Boss' office and says, <<<
My project is being thwarted by a woman who gets satisfaction from being unhelpful.
>>> The Boss responds, <<<
Have you tried using your charm?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I guess I can try.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Ha ha ha! Just kidding.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
But seriously, try hounding her until she recoils in pain at the sound of your voice.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Will that work?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Sometimes the best you can do is make other people feel bad.

My first act as temporary boss is revamping our project status color codes.

Red, yellow, and green will be replaced by white, off-white, and eggshell.

I have to confess, it was embarrassing to realize I only have one idea.

Dilbert is sitting at his computer. Wally approaches. Dilbert asks, <<<
How do you like sitting in for The Boss?
>>> Wally responds, <<<
It's easy.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
All I do is walk around and make people loathe me while I avoid making decisions.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's all you ever did before.
>>> Wally replies, <<<
Apparently, I was grossly underpaid.

2002-07-10 * 
Wally says to Carol, <<<
Carol, I'm filling in for the pointy-haired boss, so that makes you my secretary.

I will make you pay dearly for your arrogance!

Could you put a head on this?

2002-07-09 * 
The Boss says to Wally, <<<
Wally, it's your turn to be in charge while I'm on vacation.

Ooh-baby! you want some of this. Yes, you do.

The Boss addresses a meeting, <<<
Does anyone have any ideas for boosting morale?
>>> Wally raises his hand, <<<
Oooh! Oooh! Oooh!
>>> Wally says, <<<
The employee potluck lunch that we had last year was almost perfect.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
But we only had it once and some people had schedule conflicts.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
I call my idea the 'Permanent Virtual Individual Employee Potluck' or P.V.I.E.P for short.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Every day, each employee brings a small meal in a bag and eats it whenever he gets hungry.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You already do that. <<<
 Wally replies, <<<
And look how happy I am!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Okay, who is going to organize the P.V.I.E.P.?

Alice hasn't helped yet.

A senior manager says to The Boss, <<<
I can't tell you how much your budget is, because if I did, you'd try to spend all of it.

Can you tell me when I'm over budget?
>>> The senior manager replies, <<<
No, because then you'd know what the budget is.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Can you tell me what our company strategy is?
>>> The senior manger replies, <<<
Sure. It's... Ha ha ha! Just kidding.

2002-07-05 * 
The Boss says to Wally, <<<
I'm having these coffee meetings to find out how I can improve morale.

My only problem was that I wasn't drinking enough coffee with you. So now I'm good, thanks.

Promise me you'll never leave this table. I can't go back to the way things were.
>>> 
2002-07-04 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
You're the first employee for my 'Coffee with the Boss' program.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Feel free to say whatever is on your mind. Don't hold back. Give it to me straight.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
My chair has a squeak.
>>> The Boss yells, <<<
You ungrateful whiny wretch!!!
>>> 
2002-07-03 * 
The Boss says to Carol, <<<
I call my idea 'Coffee with the Boss.' Each employee will get one hour of quality time with me.
>>> Carol responds, <<<
I'd rather staple a skunk to my forehead and go to a trade show for banjo makers.
>>> Carol continues, <<<
And yet, it's still better than working, so count me in.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
That's the spirit!
>>> 
2002-07-02 * 
Dilbert points to a slide and says, <<<
My technology test was a huge failure because I had to use a rope as my electronic cable.

Our procurement manager is a monkey who signed an exclusive cable contract with a rope vendor.

I'd rather not take sides until I hear the monkey's version.

No. That's a piece of rope. Yes, I know it's cheaper.

Well, maybe it was a mistake to sign an exclusive contract with a rope distributor.

Ooh hoo hoo jerk.

2002-06-30 * 
The Boss interrupts a meeting and says, <<<
Dilbert, can you come with me to a meeting?
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
Actually, no. I'm running this meeting and it took three weeks to get everyone together.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If I leave now, sixteen people will be wasting their time.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'll cover for you.
>>> Dilbert says to Wally, <<<
You will?
>>> Wally replies, <<<
Sure. Just leave your notes and I'll take care of it.
>>> Dilbert follows The Boss and says, <<<
What's the meeting about?

It's not exactly a meeting.

I need someone to drink the crud on the bottom and then brew a fresh pot.
>>> Back at the meeting, Wally calls a vote, <<<
All in favor of leaving before he gets back.

Alice, you should act as if you're your own boss.

Okay.

My hair is pointy and I'm confused. Suddenly I have no respect for myself.

Must...golf... now.

That is so-o-o not funny.
>>> 
2002-06-28 * 
Wally says to The Boss and Dilbert, <<<
I'm in a battle of wills with a guy who lets all of his calls roll over to voicemail.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
I do that too, so all day long we trade messages saying, 'Call me,' and then we ignore the incoming calls.
>>> The Boss suggests, <<<
Maybe he's out of the office.
>>> Wally responds, <<<
No, I can hear him. He's one cube over from me.
>>> 
2002-06-27 * 
The Boss stops a sad employee and says, <<<
Hey, guy, cheer up. You can choose to have a good attitude!

I just found out I have six months to live.

Maybe I'm saying it wrong. Try reading the book yourself.
>>> 
2002-06-26 * 
Catbert says to a meeting, <<<
This survey will help us improve morale.
>>> Dilbert turns to Catbert and says, <<<
I misjudged you. I thought you were an evil director of H.R., but you care about morale.

When we fire this disgruntled guy, my morale will go way up.

Hee Hee!

Roboboss, can this relationship work? After all, I'm a human..

And you're a soulless machine designed to give shallow compliments to employees.

You're giving 110&#037;.

Stop.. don't make me love you.

Roboboss says to Alice, <<<
I am Roboboss. You are a valuable asset. Keep up the good work.

So.. Are you seeing anyone?

High five!

The Boss is with another man and introduces him to Dilbert. The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, I'd like you to interview Matt for our department.
>>> Dilbert asks Matt, <<<
There's a three-year gap in your work history. What were you doing?
>>> Matt replies, <<<
One day I was balancing my checkbook and noticed a bank error.
>>> Matt continues, <<<
So I embarked on a three-year mission to make the bank admit its mistake!
>>> Matt continues, <<<
I worked the phones day and night, rarely eating or bathing.
>>> Matt continues, <<<
Then came the sit-ins, the media frenzy and the landmark court case.
>>> Matt exclaims, <<<
The bank claimed that seven minus four is three. And I'm like, 'Since when?'
>>> After the interview, The Boss asks Dilbert, <<<
Would he fit in?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Unfortunately, yes.

You know what makes your work stories fascinating?
>>> Dilbert asks. <<<
What?
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Nothing.
>>> 
2002-06-21 * 
Dilbert points to a slide and says, <<<
As requested, my project team has added impenetrable complications to our accounting records.
>>> Dilbert says to The Boss, <<<
And an outside firm is erasing all memories from senior management.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
How do they do that?
>>> Dogbert holds a hammer. He says to a manager with a huge bump on his head, <<<
Okay, you're ready to talk to congress.

Thank you.

Dilbert, the troll, and Asok are meeting. Dilbert says, <<<
Our assignment is to make our accounting system less transparent.

What?

We don't want investors to know what we're doing.

Are we bad people?

We're good people who have been influenced by a corrupt corporate culture.

Oh, okay. Carry on.

Dilbert says to an accounting troll, <<<
I need you to be a subject matter expert on my accounting system project.

I think so.

I'm in.

What's it like to be an accounting troll?

To be honest, I'm only in it for the groupies.
>>> 
2002-06-18 * 
Dilbert comes home and says to Dogbert, <<<
My boss ordered me to make our accounting records more confusing. Is that ethical?
>>> Dogbert responds, <<<
It's as ethical as the massive short-sell I'm going to place in the next ten seconds.

Maybe you're the wrong one to ask.
>>> Dogbert yells into his phone, <<<
NOW! NOW!

Dilbert says to The Boss, <<<
Stockholders are worried that our profits are nothing but accounting gimmicks.

I'm putting you in charge of destroying all of our accounting records.

That's illegal.
>>> The Boss responds, <<<
Oh. Then just make them more confusing.

Wally is asleep in his cubicle. Asok enters and says, <<<
Wally, I need advice from the master.
>>> Wally wakes  up and says, <<<
Huh?
>>> Asok says, <<<
How do you remain so carefree while everyone else seems so overworked?
>>> Wally replies, <<<
Asok, you are ready to learn my most powerful secret.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Always volunteer to do lots of tasks. That will make you appear very busy.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Later, when someone complains that you didn't do a task...
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Say you remember discussing the topic but you don't recall agreeing to do anything.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Offer a glimmer of hope that you might yet do the task if no one yells at you... Then repeat.
>>> Asok replies, <<<
Wow.
>>> Asok walks away and thinks, <<<
He's like a Gandhi that eats.

Handle that.

I'm a new guy with no assignment. I'm looking for a project to horn into.

I'm trying to build a career based on good attendance and head-nodding.

Apparently they know what blending means.
>>> Catbert says to the other HR director, <<<
Let's see... My company offers six months of maternity leave for mothers.

That's very evil.. We'll adopt your program.

Yeah, I guess it IS easier to explain it to one person.

You  need to socialize your idea with the rest of the department.

Socialize? Is that the same as getting buy-in?

Wait...I thought that building consensus was one step below buy-  in.

Just run it up a flagpole and see who salutes.

>>> Turning to Wally, Dogbert says, <<<
Employees stay here because they don't know there are better jobs across the street.

I've been very busy.
>>> Dilbert says to The Boss, <<<
This project has been your top priority for over a year!!!
>>> Dilbert says to The Boss, <<<
You only had one task: get funding.
>>> Dilbert asks The Boss, <<<
What have you been doing for the past year?! The Boss says, <<<
I remember attending meetings...
>>> Dilbert, holding his head in his hands, cries, <<<
Aay iii yiii yiii!!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
If you need anything, just holler.
>>> 
2000-12-16 * 
Dilbert, pointing to a diagram, asks, <<<
Are there any questions?
>>> Three co-workers sit at a table looking stupefied. There is a paper airplane and a cup that's been knocked over spilling some liquid on the table. Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
Do you ever feel alone when you're with people?
>>> Dogbert, reading and not looking up, says, <<<
I try to.
>>> 
2000-12-15 * 
Dilbert says to a co-worker, <<<
Why did you cross-charge your time to my budget?
>>> The co-worker says, <<<
I attended your meeting.
>>> Dilbert says to the co-worker, <<<
All you did was sit there like a drunken monkey. I want a refund.
>>> The co-worker says, <<<
Talk to my boss.
>>> Dilbert says to the woman who is his co-worker's boss, <<<
... So it doesn't seem fair.
>>> The woman looks at her watch and says, <<<
Ka-ching!
>>> 
2000-12-14 * 
Noriko watches as The Boss gestures toward Wally and says, <<<
If anything happens to me, Wally will be your leader.
>>> Wally thinks, <<<
?
>>> Reaching for her purse, Noriko exclaims to The Boss, <<<
I have a multi-vitamin! Quick, take it!
>>> Noriko listens to The Boss' pulse with a stethoscope while Dilbert massages The Boss' shoulders. The Boss holds a glass of water. Noriko says, <<<
We're safe for now.
>>> Wally says, <<<
This turned out to be a mixed blessing.
>>> 
2000-12-13 * 
The Boss says to Dogbert, <<<
I've been told to make a succession plan.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The plan should say what to do if I die.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I can help.
>>> Dogbert says to The Boss, <<<
And if Satan makes you stand in flaming worms up to your nose, try standing on your tiptoes for eternity.
>>> 
2000-12-12 * 
Dilbert asks The Boss, <<<
Is that what you wanted?
>>> The Boss answers, <<<
I'm not saying.
>>> The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
If I tell you it's good, you'll rub it in my face at your performance review.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm sorry.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
See how you are?
>>> 
2000-12-11 * 
Dilbert says to The Boss, <<<
We don't have enough engineers to handle all the requests for sales support.
>>> The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
Build an online database to log all the requests.
>>> Dilbert says to The Boss, <<<
It might look as if I'm staring at you with a mixture of contempt and disbelief, but I'm actually meditating.
>>> 
2000-12-10 * 
Noriko says to Dilbert, <<<
And we'll have sub-second response time. Dilbert says to Noriko, <<<
Actually, it's already two seconds, and your change will add two more.
>>> Noriko exclaims to Dilbert, <<<
Why do you always have to be right?!
>>> Noriko says to Dilbert, <<<
Just once can't you admit I'm right?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Okay, I admit that two plus two equals less than one.
>>> Noriko says, <<<
I don't mean now, jerk. I mean in general.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Okay. In general I admit that the rules of physics are optional.
>>> Noriko exclaims, <<<
You're doing it wrong!!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You're right. My fault again.
>>> 
2000-12-09 * 
Dilbert stands in the jury box in a court room and reads from a paper in his hands, <<<
We find the defendant guilty...
>>> The judge listens as Dilbert continues, <<<
... of this crime and maybe a few others that didn't come up.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Lastly, do you have any brochures for the Witness Protection Program?
>>> 
2000-12-08 * 
Dilbert sits in a jury box in a court room listening to a lawyer who says, <<<
My client's life now rests in your capable hands.

Zzzz zzzzz zzz.
>>> JURY DELIBERATIONS: The juror who had been sleeping in the jury box asks Dilbert, <<<
Did anything happen after 'Please rise'?
>>> 
2000-12-07 * 
In the jury box in a court room, a prospective juror sitting next to Dilbert says, <<<
Your honor, it is against my religion to judge others. Only God may judge.
>>> The judge says, <<<
You're excused.
>>> Dilbert watches another prospective juror raise his hand and say, <<<
Ooh ooh! I just changed my religion!
>>> The excused juror walks away thinking, <<<
Jerk.
>>> 
2000-12-06 * 
A judge in a court room asks, <<<
Juror eight, do you have any medical problems that would prevent you from serving?
>>> In the jury box, a juror with a large hole in his head answers, <<<
No, I need jury duty.
>>> The judge asks, <<<
Would it be fair to say you don't know what you need?
>>> Juror eight answers, <<<
Why does everyone ask me that?
>>> 
2000-12-05 * 
Dilbert is sitting in the jury room with two other people. The man sitting next to him asks, <<<
What excuse are you planning to use?
>>> Dilbert says to the man, <<<
I'm happy to serve. It's my civic responsibility.
>>> The man says to Dilbert, <<<
Insanity; good one.
>>> 
2000-12-04 * 
Dilbert looks at a sign pointing toward the 'Jury Room' and thinks, <<<
Aahh, one sweet week away from my job.
>>> As he gets his jury duty paperwork from a civil servant, Dilbert thinks, <<<
I'll have hours of quiet time to read my new book.
>>> Dilbert sits reading surrounded by several people all talking on their cell phones, <<<
Yadda yadda blah blah blah yadda blah blah yack yack.
>>> The woman next to him says into her cell phone, <<<
There's a guy here with a book.
>>> 
2000-12-03 * 
Wally says to The Boss, <<<
I'd like to work flex time.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'll work for five hours before anyone else gets to the office...
>>> Wally says to The Boss, <<<
Then I'll take a break for ten hours...
>>> Wally says, <<<
Then I'll work five more hours after the witnesses... er... co-workers go home.
>>> Wally says, <<<
You'll know I'm working hard because my cubicle will be filthy.
>>> Wally says, <<<
But I have to be perfectly honest: There's a down side to this plan.
>>> Wally says to The Boss, <<<
I would miss your staff meetings that I cherish so much.
>>> Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
I'm having trouble keeping my clever schemes separate from my sarcasm.
>>> 
2000-12-02 * 
Sitting up on the floor, Asok rubs his head and says to The Boss, Dilbert and Wally, <<<
I'm alive!
>>> Asok asks Dilbert, The Boss, Wally and Alice, <<<
Which one of you angels administered the life-saving CPR?
>>> Ratbert says to The Boss, Asok and Alice, <<<
Speaking of 'Lifesavers,' I could sure use one right now.
>>> 
2000-12-01 * 
Asok the Intern is lying on the floor with his legs sticking straight up in the air. Dilbert says to Wally, Alice and The Boss, <<<
I'll see if the guys in marketing know First Aid.
>>> Ted says to Dilbert, <<<
Really? I picked that intern in our engineering dead pool!
>>> Dilbert says to Wally and Alice as Asok continues lying on the floor, <<<
Apparently our team-building potluck lunch didn't take.
>>> 
2000-11-30 * 
Asok the Intern is down and his legs are sticking straight up in the air. Dilbert says to Wally, Alice and The Boss, <<<
Okay, we have one vote for using CPR, one vote for the Heimlich Maneuver...
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
And two votes for sneaking up behind him and yelling 'boo'.
>>> Dilbert, Wally, Alice and The Boss look at Asok lying on the floor as Dilbert says, <<<
I don't see how we can get behind him.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
What if we drill a hole from below?
>>> 
2000-11-29 * 
Dilbert, Catbert and The Boss look at Asok the Intern's legs sticking straight up in the air. Dilbert asks, <<<
Asok is down. Does anyone know CPR?
>>> The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
Is CPR the one where we take his kidney and leave him in a tub of ice?
>>> Dilbert says to The Boss, <<<
Um... I don't think so.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We'd better strip him and shave him just in case.
>>> 
2000-11-28 * 
Catbert says to Dilbert and Asok the Intern, <<<
The company will be holding mandatory CPR training for all employees.

GAA!!

I am surrounded by pear-shaped, beef-eating, middle-aged men who I prefer not to touch.
>>> Catbert and The Boss look on as Asok rubs his chest and says, <<<
Uh-oh... I hope that's just stress.
>>> 
2000-11-27 * 
Catbert says to Wally, <<<
Wally, we can't find our CPR dummy. I need your help.
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Finding it?
>>> Catbert says to Wally, <<<
Yes. Assuming you can do that while lying on your back with your mouth open.
>>> 
2000-11-26 * 
Dilbert, putting a paper on The Boss' desk, says to The Boss, <<<
My analysis shows that your pet project isn't feasible.
>>> The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
Try working the numbers.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That wouldn't change the underlying reality.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
What if we massaged the numbers?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Massaging the numbers means the same thing as working the numbers.
>>> Dilbert says to The Boss, <<<
You can't make the impossible possible by hallucinating new numbers.
>>> Dilbert asks The Boss, <<<
Do you have any other ideas?
>>> The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
That depends on the the phrase 'fiddle with the numbers' means.
>>> 
2000-11-25 * 
The Boss says to Asok the Intern, <<<
I used to not care about my subordinates.
>>> The Boss says to Asok, <<<
But that's all changed.
>>> The Boss says to Asok as Alice, The Boss' secretary, looks on, <<<
Now I delegate the not-caring function to what's-her-face over here.
>>> 
2000-11-24 * 
A male employee says to Dilbert, <<<
Dilbert, my man, you're stayin' real and keepin' to the core.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Is that good?
>>> The employee says, <<<
I don't even know what it means.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why do you say things that have no meaning?
>>> The employee answers, <<<
Du-u-u-de!
>>> 
2000-11-23 * 
Dilbert and Wally are both wearing aprons. Dilbert, counting money, asks Wally, <<<
How much did you make in tips today?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Three breath mints and one death threat scrawled on a napkin.
>>> Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
I hope I don't forget which breath mint came from the napkin guy.
>>> 
2000-11-22 * 
Holding a binder in his hands, Wally thinks, <<<
I hate working for tips.
>>> A female employee says, <<<
No, I ordered the R.F.P.
>>> Wally says to the employee, <<<
Maybe you were thinking R.F.P. but you said spec binder, you arrogant cow!
>>> The employee grimaces as she holds the binder and Wally thinks, <<<
With any luck, she'll say, 'You had me at cow'.
>>> 
2000-11-21 * 
Wally says to an employee sitting at a computer, <<<
My name is Wally and I'll be your engineer.
>>> Wally says to the employee, <<<
Our special today is incomprehensible mumbling in an acronym sauce with a snide of attitude.
>>> The employee says, <<<
I'll just have a technical review.
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Do you want sarcasm with that?
>>> 
2000-11-20 * 
Wally says to Alice and Dilbert, <<<
All music on the internet should be free. Artists could make money from digital tips.
>>> Catbert says to Wally, <<<
Great idea. We'll do the same thing here with the engineers.
>>> Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
Have you ever noticed that my ideas are only brilliant when applied to other people?
>>> 
2000-11-19 * 
Dogbert, busily typing, says to Dilbert, <<<
I'm writing a business book called 'Change Happens. Get Over It'.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The title says it all.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Yeah. It needs filler.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
How about a parable?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Good idea.
>>> Dogbert types, <<<
Two bulls were talking.
>>> Dogbert continues typing, <<<
One bull says, 'I'm afraid of change'.
>>> Dogbert continues typing, <<<
The other bull says, 'Get over it'.
>>> Dogbert continues typing, <<<
Later that day they were both ground into hamburgers and served at a picnic.
>>> Dogbert says to Dilbert, <<<
The hard part will be finding someone to write the foreword.
>>> 
2000-11-18 * 
Asok the Intern, holding a stack of paper, says to the temp who has an extra hand growing out of the top of his head, <<<
These copies you made for me are blank.
>>> The temp says to Asok, <<<
That's because all the originals were blank.
>>> Asok says to the temp, <<<
Maybe you could have checked the other sides.
>>> The temp says, <<<
Talk to the hand.
>>> 
2000-11-17 * 
Dilbert is sitting at his computer. The new temp, who has an extra hand growing out of the top of his head, says to Dilbert, <<<
I'm from the Dogbert Temp Agency. Do you need a hand?
>>> Dilbert, looking at the temp, says, <<<
I get it. Hee hee!
>>> The temp says, <<<
Get what?
>>> Dilbert says to Wally, <<<
Then I said, 'Don't get mad: try counting to fifteen'.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Ouch.
>>> 
2000-11-16 * 
The new temp, who has an extra hand sticking out of the top of his head, holds out a hand to Alice and says, <<<
It's a pleasure to meet you, Alice.
>>> Alice, grimacing, shakes hands with the hand on the top of the temp's head. Alice grimaces and looks at her hand. The temp looks up toward the extra hand on top of his head and says, <<<
Ooowee! That was a good hand shake.
>>> 
2000-11-15 * 
Catbert says to The Boss, <<<
The Dogbert Temp Agency uses genetic engineering to grow our own workers.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Isn't that dangerous?
>>> Catbert says, <<<
I wear safety goggles.
>>> A man with an extra hand sticking out of the top of his head says to Alice, <<<
I'm the new temp.
>>> Alice, looking at the top of his head and holding out her hand, says, <<<
Um... I'm Alice.
>>> 
2000-11-14 * 
The Boss says to Catbert, <<<
What's the most evil way to use our database of customer information? The Boss says, <<<
Should we sell our mailing lists, spam without mercy, or just blackmail customers?
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Um... Do you have me in that database?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We know all about your clumping problems.
>>> 
2000-11-13 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
We have a gigantic database full of customer behavior information.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Excellent. We can use non-linear math and data mining technology to optimize our retail channels!
>>> The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
If that's the same thing as spam, we're having a good meeting here.
>>> 
2000-11-12 * 
Noriko says to Dilbert, <<<
I signed you up for a trip to the South Pole.
>>> Dilbert asks Noriko, <<<
Um... why?
>>> Noriko says to Dilbert, <<<
You'll love it. You leave tomorrow.
>>> Dilbert says forcefully to Noriko, <<<
I am not going to the South Pole!
>>> Noriko says to Dilbert, <<<
Oh, I get it; You're a control freak.
>>> Dilbert yells, <<<
GAAA! Can't you see that it's you who is trying to control me?!! Noriko says to Dilbert, <<<
All I see is you trying to manipulate me into not sending you to the South Pole.
>>> Dilbert, dressed in a fur-trimmed parka and carrying a suitcase, says to Catbert, <<<
It seemed easier.
>>> 
2000-11-11 * 
The Boss says to Wally and Dilbert, <<<
I declare next Friday to be 'Hawaiian Shirt Day'.
>>> Wally says as The Boss smiles, <<<
Hey, you're disguising punishments as perks!
>>> The Boss says to Catbert, <<<
They're on to us.
>>> Catbert asks, <<<
Did you try the fake smile?
>>> 
2000-11-10 * 
The Boss, reaching for a paper that Alice is handing him, says, <<<
Thanks, Hun.
>>> Alice exclaims, <<<
Hon?!
>>> Alice says to The Boss, <<<
You sexist &#037;!*&#037;! I will burn your village and make slaves of your children!
>>> The Boss says to Alice, <<<
It's short for Attila the Hun. Everyone calls you that.
>>> Alice says, <<<
That seems harsh.
>>> 
2000-11-09 * 
Alice says to Dilbert, <<<
I'm learning to golf.
>>> Alice says to Dilbert, <<<
Now I won't be excluded from all the male-dominated golf events.
>>> Dilbert says to Wally, who's staring at his computer screen, <<<
Have you been dominating golf events?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Sometimes I can make them miss putts on TV.
>>> 
2000-11-08 * 
Catbert, standing on The Boss' desk, says to The Boss, <<<
You can compensate for your lack of knowledge by talking too much.
>>> Catbert says to The Boss, <<<
And don't be limited by society's expectation that you be interesting.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Sometimes I like to sit quietly and think up ideas.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Nothing good can come from that.
>>> 
2000-11-07 * 
Wally says to The Boss, <<<
You should put an 'E-' in front of your title.
>>> Wally says, <<<
It's too boring just being the Director of Information, Operations and Technology.
>>> The Boss says to his secretary, Carol, <<<
From now on, call me the E-DIOT.
>>> Carol says, <<<
If only there were an easy way to remember that.
>>> 
2000-11-06 * 
Noriko, holding a 'Do Not Disturb' sign, says to Dilbert, <<<
This sign is my passport to cubicle tranquillity.
>>> Putting up the sign on the outside of her cubicle, Noriko says to Dilbert, <<<
I wonder why no one ever thought of it before.
>>> Noriko, sitting at her computer, frowns angrily as Wally says, <<<
Nice sign. Does it keep away the undesirables?
>>> 
2000-11-05 * 
Ted asks, <<<
Am I fired?
>>> The Boss, sitting at his desk, answers, <<<
Of course not, Ted. I enjoy e-mailed jokes as much as anyone.
>>> Ted smiles as The Boss says, <<<
I'm still laughing about your 'Top Ten Signs That Your Boss Is a Hairless Rodent'.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I asked you here to discuss the reclassification of your job.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Starting today, the job requires a Ph.D. Feel free to apply for your own job.
>>> Ted says, <<<
Whew! Luckily, I have a Ph.D.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You do? Well, the job also requires an Olympic Gold Medal.
>>> Holding up the medal around his neck, Ted says, <<<
Synchronized Swimming, 1992.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
And a posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor.
>>> 
2000-11-04 * 
Dilbert sits at a table in a restaurant with a woman who says, <<<
I've always been an incurable romantic.
>>> Diblert says to the woman, <<<
Do you mind if I take off my shoe? I've got some sort of fungus that needs air.
>>> The woman shouts, <<<
I'm cured!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I like to scratch it on the table leg. -- Oops. Is that you?
>>> 
2000-11-03 * 
Ted, who has the letter 'R' painted on his chest, says to Wally, <<<
Today is my last day. I'm saying my farewells.
>>> Wally looks at Ted as Ted says, <<<
We've never talked, but I was working my way down the row and here you are.
>>> Ted says, <<<
So... Let's stay in touch.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Don't be a stranger.
>>> 
2000-11-02 * 
Ted, who has the letter 'E' painted on his chest, says to The Boss, <<<

Could you find it within your heart...

I'll check.
>>> Ted watches as The Boss looks at the heart. The Boss says, <<<
Nope. No jobs in there.
>>> 
2000-11-01 * 
Dilbert is staring at his computer screen. Ted has the letter 'O' painted on his chest. Ted says to Dilbert, <<<
I need a new job within the company before the window shuts.
>>> Ted says, <<<
Catbert is already up to 'O.' Next week he gets an 'S'.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What's he spelling?
>>> Ted says to Dilbert, <<<
He wouldn't say, but it starts with an 'L'.
>>> 
2000-10-31 * 
Catbert, standing on a table, says to Ted, <<<
Ted, your thirty-day dance of death begins today.
>>> Shaking a bottle of spray-paint, Catbert says, <<<
You must find a new job within the company during that time.
>>> As Catbert spray-paints the letter 'L' on Ted's chest, Ted says, <<<
Is the spray-paint absolutely necessary?
>>> Catbert says, <<<
That's an 'L'.
>>> 
2000-10-30 * 
Dilbert is standing in front of Carol the Secretary's desk.  She says to him, <<<
My son is flunking all his classes.  I'm hoping he can get a job involving computers.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Carrying them?
>>> Back home, at the end of the day, Dilbert confesses to Dogbert, <<<
People don't like it when you fill in the blanks in their stories.
>>> 
2000-10-29 * 
A smiling female employee, handing Dilbert change, says, <<<
Thank you. Have a nice day.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
She's flirting with me.
>>> Dilbert says to the woman, <<<
Um... Would you like to go out on Saturday?
>>> The woman, still smiling, says, <<<
I wasn't flirting. This is my phony customer service smile.
>>> The woman says to Dilbert, <<<
Employees are required to smile.
>>> Dilbert asks the woman, <<<
Okay. But now you're flirting, aren't you?
>>> The woman answers, <<<
No, still phony.
>>> Walking away, Dilbert thinks, <<<
Wally has to see this.
>>> Wally and Dilbert stand looking at the smiling woman. Wally says, <<<
Hey, it looks like she's flirting with me!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Is this great or what?
>>> 
2000-10-28 * 
The Boss, looking at a piece of paper, asks Dilbert, <<<
And what's your reason for leaving your previous job?
>>> Dilbert answers, <<<
You fired me yesterday for non-business use of the internet.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Crime doesn't pay.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Wait until you hear my minimum acceptable salary.
>>> 
2000-10-27 * 
Catbert is standing on the boss's desk.  Catbert says, <<<
I fired everyone who used the internet for personal stuff.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
The only wrinkle in that policy is that you and I are the only employees left.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
And frankly, I use the web for personal stuff too.
>>>  The boss says, <<<
Can you teach me how?
>>> 
2000-10-26 * 
Dilbert, sitting at his computer, thinks, <<<
I..must..resist..using..the internet for personal reasons.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Gaa!  There's a whole world of knowledge and entertainment at my fingertips...teasing me!
>>> Catbert dangles an ice-cream cone from a pole in front of Dilbert.  Dilbert says, <<<
Ice Cream!  I'm so hungry!
>>>  Catbert says, <<<
No eating in your cubicle.
>>> 
2000-10-25 * 
Catbert, sitting at his desk, says to an employee, <<<
Our records show that you used the internet for personal reasons.  You're fired.
>>> The employee says, <<<
Please, I merely ordered groceries online so that I might have more time for working.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
My motto is, you can't spell 'who cares?' without H.R.
>>>  The employee says, <<<
It's evil, but it's true.
>>> 
2000-10-24 * 
Catbert is standing on Wally's desk.  Catbert says, <<<
Your personal use of the internet is like stealing from the company!
>>> Wally says, <<<
You work in Human Resources; that's like stealing from the company, too.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Maybe we should form a gang.
>>> 
2000-10-23 * 
The boss, walking past Dilbert, says,  <<<
What the...?
>>> The boss says, <<<
You still work here?
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
That's gonna take a bite out of my productivity.
>>> 
2000-10-22 * 
The boss is walking and thinking, <<<
Sometimes a manager must deliver bad news.
>>> The boss, behind Dilbert, thinks, <<<
Luckily I enjoy it.
>>> The boss says, <<<
Our sales force failed to meet their goals.
>>> The boss continues, <<<
So I have to fire an engineer to reduce expenses.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
What?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You should fire the incompetent sales people!
>>> Dilber continues, <<<
It's immoral to punish innocent engineers for the sins of sales people!  I will fight this all the way!
>>> The boss says, <<<
I'm firing Ted.  Not you.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Fair enough.  Can you wait until I borrow his hole puncher?
>>> 
2000-10-21 * 
Catbert says to Alice, <<<
You think you're satisfied with your job.
>>> Catbert continues, yelling, <<<
In reality you're just afraid of change!

That was some of my best work.
>>> 
2000-10-20 * 
A man is standing in front of the boss.  The man says, <<<
You're working me too hard!  I want to get home in time to kiss my daughter goodnight!

And I'm not the only one who feels this way.
>>> The boss says, <<<
I've seen your daughter and I'm fairly certain you're the only one.
>>> 
2000-10-19 * 
The boss is sitting across from a terrified looking person.  The boss says, <<<
I understand that you were raised in a dysfunctional family.

Yes

You're gonna work seventy hours a week or you're worthless!!

You love me.
>>>  The boss says, <<<
Are there any more like you at home?
>>> 
2000-10-18 * 
Dogbert is standing on the boss's desk.  Dogbert says to the boss, <<<
You need 'Dogbert's Dysfunctional Employee Recruitment Services.'
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I only recruit employees who were raised in dysfunctional families.  They don't mind being mistreated!
>>> The boss says, <<<
How soon can you get me some?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I have a dozen in the trunk of my car.
>>>

That's easy to say.

So according to your philosophy, you shouldn't have said it.

Wally, our auditors found 40 gigabits of bikini pictures on your PC.

That is grounds for dismissal.  How do you plead?
>>> Wally thinks to himself, <<<
Innocent.  Technically, they didn't find any pictures.
>>> Wally says to Catbert, <<<
What they found were zeroes and ones resting harmlessly on magnetic media.

It was the auditors themselves who activated thoe harmless bits to form pictures on the screen.

Install it in the break room tonight.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It's cheaper than a real camera and it will discourage thefts.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If you treat employees like criminals, they'll leave.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Good point. You'd better hide the fake camera so no one knows it's there.

Wild guesses are used as surrogates for knowledge.
>>> Dilbert says to the Boss, <<<
Project deadlines ae tied to trade show dates instead of reality.

Then management cuts the budget until failure is assured.
>>> Dilbert says to the Boss, <<<
I assume you called me here so you can apologize for your role in all this.

Would you like to hear how budgets are created?

Was it the inefficiency or the drain of morale?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Important executives don't use voice mail.

I have some information for you.
>>> The Boss answers, <<<
Call me.

>>> The man leaves Dogbert carrying a gigantic pencil over his shoulder. 
2000-05-08 * 
Dogbert says to Dilbert as they sit together at the kitchen table, <<<

How would that help anyone?

I lead by example, my friend.

His social policies are the exact opposite of your views.

Really?

Well, I like his tax plan.

Every credible economist thinks it's a bad plan.

It's a good thing we talked before you polluted the system with your vote.

Do you want to make out?

Specifically, you gave them pawns.

You scheduled a four-hour meeting to find out why people are behind schedule!

Wait. Let me guess why you're here.

>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's something that could easily wait until tomorrow.
>>> He says, <<<
But you'll insist that I handle it now, because you're a sociopath.

Wrong. I majored in anthropology.

Dogbert stands on the table and says to Ken the Skeptic, <<<
If your controlled tests have never found psychic powers, how do you know the tests work for that sort of thing?
>>> Ken glares and folds his arms across his chest. Dogbert says, <<<
Isn't that like using a metal detector to find out if there are unicorns in your sock drawer?
>>> Ken says, <<<
No!
>>> Later that night... Ken thinks, <<<
A skeptic checks all the drawers.
>>> He runs a metal detector over a chest of drawers.

>>>  Dilbert reads the piece of paper. Dogbert says, <<<
If it wasn't fun, it must have been work.
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
Dogbert, let me explain what friendship is all about.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Friendship is about giving freely of oneself.  It's about trust and sharing.

Now, I expect you'll want this back.

Yes.

A man in glasses and a sweatshirt jacket walks in. Dilbert says, <<<
I'm glad the Skeptics Association sent you to debunk my rat's claims of ESP.

Well, I'm glad you could make it.
>>> The skeptic says, <<<
Let's hurry. I have to debunk the so-called Hubble Telescope later today.
>>> 
1998-01-15 * 
Dilbert is talking on the telephone and says, <<<
Is this Skeptics Association? I need your help to prove my rat isn't psychic.
>>> Dilbert holds the phone and says, <<<
My name is Dilbert. Yes, I can prove it; I have a pssport and a driver's license. Well, yeah. It's easy to get a fake ID, but...
>>> Hours later... Dilbert is still on the phone, his hair is a mess and he says, <<<
...Okay, what if I take a DNA test? No, I can't prove I've never been cloned!!
>>> He's angry. 
1998-01-14 *

Just because you guessed a hundred coin flips in a row doesn't mean you're psychic.

That is luck... luck, luck, luck, luck, luck!

Are we done now?

Call it.
>>> Ratbert trows out his hands and says, <<<
Edge.

That was just coincidence.

I call edge for the next 99, too.
>>> 
1998-01-12 *

Wow!

Ted's brother was a mobster. Last week he was killed by a rival family's hit team.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
We got Ted a sympathy card, then it snowballed into a surprise party for tomorrow. My job is to write a funny song.

For he's a buried good fellow... for he's a buried good fellow... which nobody can deny...

Good.

Carol, the Boss's secretary, is taking wirting in a note pad. She says to Wally, <<<
Are you free on Thursday for Ted's surprise party?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Party? You don't give a party for someone who has a death in the family.
>>> Carol says, <<<
Well... we got him a card, then flowers. It just snowballed.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I assume this will all be in good taste.
>>> Carol says, <<<
I can't promise that. Karaoke is really hit or miss.

Dilbert holds a greeting card and says, <<<
Let's see... it looks like you haven't signed Ted's card yet.
>>> Alice is sitting at her computer and glares. Alice slams a rubber stamp down on the card. Dilbert looks at the card and says, <<<
Do you think 'congratulations' is appropriate for a death in his family?

You never know.

Alice is having a performance review. She says, <<<
Alice, I had to ding you for not keeping me informed about your project.

Not exactly.

I got a bomb threat. I didn't tell anyone else, just in case it was a hoax. Dilbert says, <<<
It was only yesterday that I was saying my morale couldn't be any lower.

Nobel Prize Committee: The three guys with Albert Einstein hair look at a stack of papers and say, <<<
Okay, we've narrowed it down to the theories we don't understand.
>>> One guy says, <<<
In science, the simplest solution is usually the best. Which of these theories is the simplest solution?
>>> The second guy says, <<<
Well... that would be whatever is on top of the pile.
>>> The third guy says, <<<
Are you SURE we can't vote for ourselves?
>>> 
1998-01-01 * 
Dilbert is sitting on the couch. Ratbert says, <<<
I submitted our garbage man's theory to the Nobel prize committee.

1997-12-31 * 
The garbage man sits on the ground talking to Ratbert. He syas, <<<
...As your consciousness passes through each universe, you tend to follow a line of probability.
>>> Ratbert writes this down in a spiral notebook. He says, <<<
Got it.
>>> The garbage man says, <<<
And since it's more probable that matter is near other matter, you have the illusion of gravity as your consciousness moves toward the norm.
>>> He waves his arm in the air to demonstrate. The garbage man says, <<<
Did you get all that, Ratbert?
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
Hey, I'm not stupid. Does this Norm guy have a last name?
>>> 
1997-12-30 * 
Ratbert sits on a garbage can and says, <<<
So... each photon is a universe.. then mass is just a probability cluster?

Wow! I think my tiny skull is so full it's going to explode.

Don't get too close.

Dilbert is sitting at his computer. Ratbert says, <<<
So, I'm thinking: what if every photon is just a densely packed universe, and to them, our universe looks like a photon?
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
If I'm right, I might be the first rat to win a Nobel prize.

Stranger things have happened.

You're thinking of gazpacho.

If you use your boss's own words, you can't be disciplined for insubordination.

And do this with your lips.

Today I focused my resources on adding value to the product process. Our shareholders would be delighted to know that.

Asok looks into Wally's cubicle. Wally says into the phone, <<<
Wally is dead. Sorry.

It's impossible for most people, but I'm a trained scientist.

Alice is sitting at a table with her lap top computer and is writing something. Dan pulls up a chair and says, <<<

Oh, I get it; you're one of those religious nuts.

Okay, thanks.  That information should be in a binder.

Um... can you explain the logic here?

We're only allowed one casual day per week.

Why?

If we had TWO casual days, obviously it would have an impact on earnings.

Sure. I can't get enough touching.

Dilbert, wearing a jogging suit, sits in the grass. He says to Dogbert, <<<
If you're such a chick magnet, let's see you do your stuff.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Okay. I'll wag. They love that.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's working! You broke one out of the herd. She'd coming this way.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Be careful. I don't know how powerful this is.
>>> Dilbert grumbles. A cute girl sits next to Dogbert and says, <<<
I'll bet you work out a lot. I'm a dancer.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> 
1997-07-07 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert walk through the park. Dilbert is wearing a jogging suit and holds a Frisbee. He says, <<<
I hate it when the title of a book gives away the whole plot.
>>> Dilbert throws the Frisbee. He says, <<<
Take Hemingway's <<<
Old Man and the Sea.
>>> Geez, talk about leaving nothing to the imagination.
>>> The Frisbee lies on the ground. Dilbert says, <<<
I guess the odds were very low that you would leap in the air and catch that.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I'm only here to be a chick magnet.
>>> 
1997-07-06 * 
Wally lies in bed dreaming. In his dream, he says to The Boss, <<<
Hey, Pointy-Hair!
>>> Wally says, <<<
Thanks for the brilliant advice that I should, 'Work smarter, not harder.'
>>> Wally continues, <<<
I didn't realize people could become smarter just by wanting to.
>>> Wally groans and his head begins to bulge. He says, <<<
Watch me add a few IQ points right now!
>>> The Boss looks wide eyed. Wally says, <<<
Wow! Suddenly, I can speak Latin!
>>> Wally groans some more, <<<
Let's crank it up a few more points.
>>> Wally's head is humongous. He says, <<<
Why am I working in this dump? I should be a consultant.
>>> The dream over, Wally is at work holding a coffee cup. His head remains humongous. He says to Dilbert, <<<
When I woke up, my pillow was gone.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Oh wow. You woke up in the wrong joke.
>>>

Bob the dinosaur sits at a conference table with Ratbert and Dogbert.There are telephones on the table. Dogbert says, <<<
You two will be my telemarketers. Here's a list of known idiots to call.
>>> Ratbert takes the list and picks up the phone. <<<
I'll go first, Bob. Let's see... I dial the number and wait for an idiot to answer...

C'mon, you loser, pick up the phone.

Does telemarketing work for that sort of thing?

You'll know tomorrow; that was your voice mail.

Asok sits at his desk and speaks into the phone. <<<
Hi, Mom! Guess what.

I'm the process owner for our benchmarking intitive!
>>> Asok holds his hand over the receiver and turns to Wally. There is a PC between them. Asok says, <<<
She's crying with joy...

I used to think that too.
>>> 
1997-07-02 * 
The Boss sits at his desk. Asok the Intern says, <<<
I finally figured out why everyone talks so funny in this company.
>>> Asok says, <<<
We're not morons who are incapable of clear communication. We're rebels who like to 'think outside the box.'
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's always fascinating to watch and ego just before is dies.
>>> Asok says, <<<
I'm a rebel! Task me witha 'do it'.'
>>> 
1997-07-01 * 
Ratbert and Dilbert are sitting on the couch. Ratbert says, <<<
if the goal of all creatures is to be happy... and I'm happier than you are...
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
We can conclude that I'm more successful than you are. Isn't that right?
>>> Dilbert looks angry. Dilbert says, <<<
You are REALLY starting to annoy me now.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
The gap widens. Yes!
>>> and pumps his arm in victory. 
1997-06-30 * 
Dilbert sits on the couch surrounded by pillows drinking from a can. Dogbert stands on the arm of the couch and says, <<<
I'm putting you on a 'need to know' basis.
>>> Dogbert holds out a piece of paper and says <<<
Here's a complete list of things I need to know. if it's not on the list, I probably don't need to hear it.
>>> Dilbert reads from the list, <<<
Number One: 'Run for it Dogbert! The volcano is erupting!'
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Plurals will also be allowed.
>>> 
1997-06-29 * 
Dilbert stands across from the Boss's desk.  He says, <<<
I want a ten-percent raise.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
There's no budget for raises.
>>> Dilbert holds up a letter and says, <<<
I have an offer from another company that will pay fifteen percent more.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'll give you twenty percent if you stay.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I thought you said there's no budget for raises.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Well . . . It's supposed to be a secret but . . .
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Our policy is to give big raises to people who spend their time interviewing for other jobs.
>>> Dilbert tells Alice and Wally, <<<
Good news!  The secret company policy is to reward disloyalty!
>>> They cheer and shout, <<<
Yes!  Yippee!
>>> Wally asks, <<<
What's the reward for leaving work early?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
He wouldn't show me the price sheet.
>>> 
1997-06-28 * 
Dilbert stands across from the Boss's desk.  He says, <<<
We've identified the people who will create the system to develop a product process.
>>> Dilbert points at a newspaper and continues, <<<
While we were doing that, our competitor created a new Internet product that added a billion dollars to their stock value.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Experts attribute the company's success to their 'employee of the week' program.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Quick!  Hire those experts!
>>> 
1997-06-27 * 
The Boss, Wally, Dilbert and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
From now on, we'll nurture the passion of our rebellious employees and form strategies around them.
>>> Wally says, <<<
We don't have any rebellious employees.  The last one got fired for wearing culottes on casual day.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It was such a good idea in my head.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
We still have some sarcastic employees.  Can you work with that?
>>> 
1997-06-26 * 
Dogbert stands at a desk typing.  He tells Dilbert, <<<
I'm writing a book that debunks the effectiveness of business consultants.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But common sense would say that you're being a consultant yourself, so your opinion is logically flawed.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Only people with no common sense will buy your book.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I prefer to call them the mass market.
>>> 
1997-06-25 * 
Alice, Wally and Dilbert sit at a table.  Alice says, <<<
I did less work than usual this quarter and I got a bonus.
>>> Alice says, <<<
The implications are staggering.  The entire system of capitalism has a flawed premise.
>>> Alice says, <<<
There's only ONE thing that could make this bonus more frightening.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I got one, too.
>>> 
1997-06-24 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Alice, here's a bonus for your good work.
>>>  Alice asks, <<<
On what?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I can't be specific, because then you might do it again and expect another bonus.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Congratulations; you've motivated me to act randomly.
>>>  The Boss points and says, <<<
I'm going over here and I don't know why.
>>> 
1997-06-23 * 
Catbert stands on the back of Wally's chair.  He says, <<<
New policy: Key employees must travel on separate flights to reduce risk.
>>> Catbert sits on Wally's head and continues, <<<
Other employees, such as Wally, are encouraged to take up dangerous hobbies.
>>> Wally sits at a table with Alice and Dilbert eating lunch.  Wally says, <<<
I've noticed that when a new policy mentions me by name, it's never a good thing.
>>> 
1997-06-22 * 
Wally tells the Boss, <<<
I have a great idea to save money.
>>> Wally enter the Boss's office and continues, <<<
We can make the photocopier ink last longer by adding water to it.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Wouldn't that make the copies too light?
>>> Wally replies, <<<
Ordinarily, yes.  But we can compensate by setting the copier to 'darken.'
>>> Wally says, <<<
You'll need someone to implement this idea . . . Let's see.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Hey, how about Dilbert?  He isn't doing much work lately.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
I'd do it myself but there's no reason to waste a creative thinker on an implementation task.
>>> Dilbert asks Wally, <<<
Are you still mad that I got a bigger raise than you did?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
No, I found a creative way to deal with it.
>>> 
1997-06-21 * 
Dilbert tells Wally, <<<
. . . So our pointy-haired boss put me in charge of your project . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
. . . Because I was standing in his office when he thought about the project.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If it makes you feel better, you can keep your morale in this thimble with mine.
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
I keep mine in a 'Tic Tac' container with my ego.
>>> 
1997-06-20 * 
Dilbert sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
Give me a final design for Project Caribou by Tuesday.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
That's Wally's project.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I know, but I'm thinking about it now and Wally isn't in the room.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Tell Wally it's your project now.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Do you see this thimble?  I keep my morale in it.
>>> 
1997-06-19 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Dogbert, I need your help.  I keep getting invited to worthless meetings and I can't say no.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
YOU can say no to anything.  You have such a clearly defined sense of self-interest.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Will you teach me to be like you?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Nope . . . can't be bothered.
>>> 
1997-06-18 * 
Tina sits across from Catbert's desk.  Catbert says, <<<

Okay, I will.

I got us a family cat.  How was your day, dear?

1997-06-17 * 
Tina stands behind Asok's desk and says, <<<
You're invited to a four-hour meeting, Asok.
>>> Asok looks at the agenda and says, <<<
Tina, it would seem that all of your meetings have no purpose other than to provide you with a surrogate social life.
>>> Tina asks, <<<
Can you bring chips?
>>>  Asok says, <<<
I wish, I wish, I wish I had a spine.
>>> 
1997-06-16 * 
Tina tells Dilbert and Wally, <<<
I scheduled a two-hour T.H.N.P.L. meeting for seven o'clock on Friday night.
>>> Tina explains, <<<
T.H.N.P.L stands for 'Tina has no personal life.'  I'm scheduling useless meetings to fill the void in my life.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Tina, this is insane.
>>>  Tina asks, <<<
Are you suggesting we have a meeting to discuss it?  Is Saturday okay?
>>> 
1997-06-15 * 
The caption says, <<<
Asok the Intern explains the new rules of body language.
>>>  Asok smiles and says, <<<
Fake happiness.
>>> The caption says, <<<
This means: I am not motivated by the size of my paycheck.
>>>  Asok looks at his paycheck and sobs loudly. The caption says, <<<
This means: I am slightly concerned about the impending reorganization.
>>>  Asok shivers and looks frightened. The caption says, <<<
This means: I have decided to work in the marketing field.
>>>  Asok sticks out his tongue and turns his head in a <<<
counter-clockwise spin.
>>> The caption says, <<<
This means: I am being sarcastic.
>>>  Asok says, <<<
Oh, THERE'S a good plan.
>>>  The caption says, <<<
Note lips.
>>> The caption says, <<<
This means: The recent employee satisfaction survey has not captured the extent of my feelings.
>>>  Asok hangs in a noose. The caption says, <<<
This means: I think you are attractive but it would be very unprofessional to show it.
>>>  Asok looks at a woman and his eyes pop out of his head. The caption says, <<<
This means: My lottery investment paid off.
>>>  Asok gives the Boss a wedgie. 
1997-06-14 * 
Dilbert tells Wally, <<<
Someday it will be possible to clone or boss.
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
But the clone would have no experience and no knowledge.
>>> The Boss tells them, <<<
I just sent an e-mail message to Japan.  I don't know the language so I took your advice and typed it all in caps.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Wow.  That put it all in perspective.
>>> 
1997-06-13 * 
Dilbert and Kenny sit at a conference table.  Kenny tells a customer, <<<
No one has ever been fired for buying our product!
>>>  Dilbert adds, <<<
That's true.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
There IS the occasional savage beating . . . and more than our share of suicides . . .
>>>  Kenny looks angry. Dilbert continues, <<<
But that has 'statistical clustering' written all over it.
>>> 
1997-06-12 * 
Kenny and Dilbert sit at a conference table with a customer.  Kenny tells the man, <<<
I brought Dilbert to explain what makes our product special.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's exactly like our competitor's product except we charge more to cover the cost of our deceptive advertising.
>>> The man gets up and leaves the room.  Dilbert says, <<<
While you're up, could you get me a cup of coffee?
>>>  Kenny looks angry. 
1997-06-11 * 
Kenny tells Dilbert, <<<
When I introduce you to the customer, smile and give him a hearty slap on the back.
>>> Kenny says, <<<
Get ready.  Here he comes.
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
I'd better take some practice swings.
>>> The customer lies on the ground.  Kenny tells Dilbert, <<<
Next time, less follow-through, aim higher, and if he turns around suddenly, hold off.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Sorry.
>>> 
1997-06-10 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, you'll work with 'Kenny the sales-weasel' on our biggest prospect.
>>> Dilbert and Kenny get into a car.  Kenny says, <<<
Tell me all of our product's technical specs on the way.  I like to be prepared.
>>> They ride in the car.  Dilbert says, <<<
Our product is beige.  It uses electricity.
>>>  Kenny says, <<<
Whoa!  Brain overload!
>>> 
1997-06-09 * 
Dogbert sits on a park bench with a man in a sweat suit.  The man says, <<<
I teach my kids that these things are right and these things are wrong.  Period.  End of story.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Wouldn't that teach them to believe anything they're told without applying any critical thinking?
>>> The man replies, <<<
I don't think about that.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Duh.
>>> 
1997-06-08 * 
The Boss stands at the front of the room and says, <<<
I'm happy to award the 'clean cubicle award' to Matthew.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It's a ten-dollar 'travelers check.'  Where's Matthew?
>>> Alice, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  Dilbert says, <<<
He was cruelly downsized last month.
>>> Alice says, <<<
His cubicle was clean because he shredded his important documents out of spite.
>>> Wally says, <<<
All of his furniture and equipment were scavenged by bitter employees who have to do his work now.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
This is not having the motivational impact I had hoped for.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Okay . . . The 'travelers check' will go to whoever knows what number I'm thinking.
>>> The Boss sits at a table in a restaurant.  He hands the check to the waitress and thinks, <<<
They sure were sore losers.
>>> 
1997-06-07 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk and reads the back of an envelope.  He reads, <<<
Software Licence:  By opening this package you agree . . .
>>> Dilbert reads, <<<
. . . You will not make copies or export to despotic nations.  You will submit to strip searches in your home . . .
>>> Dilbert rips open the package.  A large woman with a flashlight in her belt enters the room.  She says, <<<
Frankly, both of us would have been happier if you had just walked away.
>>> 
1997-06-06 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
Wally, your boss asked me to tell you . . .
>>> Dogbert shouts, <<<
You're fired!!!  And they have secret videos of you stealing stuff!!!
>>>  Wally looks shocked and his tie stands up straight. Wally covers his eyes and says, <<<
This can't be true.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
It's not.  But watch how happy you are when I tell you about your one percent raise.
>>> 
1997-06-05 * 
A man lies in a hospital bed with a bandage on his nose.  Dogbert stands on the bed and says, <<<
Your doctor asked me to tell you that you have six months to live.
>>> The patient says, <<<
There must be a mistake.  I'm here for a nose job.
>>> Dogbert checks a document and says, <<<
Oh, you're right . . . I wondered why that last guy was so happy when I told him he'd have one huge nostril for the next forty years.
>>> 
1997-06-04 * 
Dogbert stands at a desk and types, <<<
We can not offer you a position at this time but you are obviously qualified.
>>> Dogbert types, <<<
Unfortunately, the other six billion people on earth are more qualified.
>>> Dogbert types, <<<
We'll keep your resume on file.
>>>  He crumples the resume into a ball and throws it over his shoulder. 
1997-06-03 * 
Dogbert stands on Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
I'm going into business as a professional bearer of bad news.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I'll try to find the humor that is inherent in every tragic situation.
>>> Dogbert stands on a woman's doorstep.  The woman says, <<<
I give up.  What IS the difference between my husband and the seventies pop group 'Village People'?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
They're coming back.
>>> 
1997-06-02 * 
Alice, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table with man who has a beard and is wearing suspenders.  The man says, <<<
I put together some guiding principles for our network architecture.
>>> Alice says, <<<
I sure hope this isn't a bunch of obvious ideas disguised with techno-jargon and unclear writing.
>>> Dilbert whispers, <<<
Let the games begin.
>>>  Alice says to the man, <<<
So tell me, do suspenders cause muddled thinking or is it the other way around?
>>> 
1997-06-01 * 
The Boss tells Dilbert and Wally, <<<
I forgot my umbrella.  I'm soaked.
>>>  His clothes are dripping wet. Dilbert says, <<<
Why don't you toss your clothes in the microwave and dry them off?
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Would that work?
>>> Dilbert and Wally are silent. The Boss stuffs his clothes in the microwave.  Dilbert says, <<<
Sixty minutes ought to do it.
>>>  Wally covers his eyes because the Boss is naked. They shut the door on the Boss.  Dilbert says, <<<
We'll guard the door to the break room.
>>> As they walk away, Wally says, <<<
You know, ever since the downsizing began, I've felt much less company loyalty.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Me too.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
Why are you two so happy?
>>>  Wally says, <<<
There are free goodies in the break room.
>>> 
1997-05-31 * 
The Boss stands behind Alice's desk and says, <<<
Alice, I understand you had a conversation with my boss without my approval.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
We don't want to give mixed messages.  It would be very bad if she got any mixed messages.
>>> Alice says, <<<
I just gave her an honest status report.
>>>  The Boss screams and yells, <<<
Mixed messages!
>>> 
1997-05-30 * 
Dogbert stands on a stool and tells Dilbert, <<<
The only way to get rid of your cloud of doom is to transfer it to a new host body.
>>>  The cloud hovers over Dilbert's head. Dogbert says, <<<
I will accomplish this with the help of your pointy-haired boss and a clueless co-worker named Tim.
>>> Dogbert straps Tim to a table and says, <<<
We're secure.  Begin transfer.
>>>  The Boss looks at a document and says, <<<
Tim, your new job will be director of special projects.
>>>  The cloud moves toward Tim. 
1997-05-29 * 
Dilbert sits on a bench with a woman wearing charred clothing.  Dilbert says, <<<
I have a cloud of doom that zaps everyone near me once a minute.
>>>  The cloud hovers over Dilbert. Dilbert continues, <<<
I'm looking for a woman who deson't think that past behavior is an indication of the future.
>>>  A bolt of lightning from the cloud strikes the woman. Dilbert continues, <<<
. . . A woman with absolutely no sense of pattern recognition.
>>>  The woman says, <<<
Ouch.  I'm glad that won't happen again.
>>> 
1997-05-28 * 
Dilbert stands in a crowd of people at a party.  The cloud of doom floats above his head.  A woman says, <<<
I notice you have a cloud of doom.  I must admit it makes you seem dangerous and sexy.
>>> A bolt of lightning from the cloud strikes the woman. Dilbert says, <<<
Sorry.  That happens to everyone who gets near me.
>>>  The woman replies, <<<
No problem.  I'm one of those women who never learn.
>>>  Smoke rises from the woman and her clothes are charred. 
1997-05-27 * 
Asok, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  Dilbert says, <<<
I need everyone's help on this project.  I hope you can overlook the cloud of doom that hovers nearby.
>>>  The cloud floats over their heads. A bolt of lightning from the cloud strikes Wally in the head. Wally falls over in his chair.  Dilbert says, <<<
Wow.  It's lucky that wasn't someone we like.
>>>  Asok looks frightened as the cloud heads toward him. 
1997-05-26 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk and says, <<<
I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you'd tell me everything you know about it.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
I've already told you more than I know.
>>> Dilbert walks away thinking, <<<
I feel like I'm being followed.
>>>  A cloud labeled "doom" follows Dilbert. 
1997-05-25 * 
Asok, Alice, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  Asok says, <<<
Lately I've been feeling discouraged about my job.
>>> Alice says, <<<
You should talk to our pointy-haired boss.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
That'll cheer you up.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Maybe you're right.  All I need is a little pep talk from our leader.
>>>  He leaves the room. Alice, Dilbert and Wally laugh. Asok sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
You think YOU're discouraged . . .
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I've been stuck in this dead-end job for years, grinding away, day after day.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
And all I have to show for it is high blood pressure and worthless stock options.
>>>  Asok looks frightened. Dilbert and Wally stand behind Asok's desk.  Dilbert says, <<<
It's so gratifying to watch them grow up.
>>>  Asok says into the telephone, <<<
I need the number for Doctor Kevorkian.

1997-05-24 * 
Dilbert lies on the couch reading.  Dogbert says, <<<
I've decided to become a consultant in the field of obvious generalities.

I'll work for small businesses that are run by artists.  They'll think I'm brilliant, which I am.
>>> Dogbert sits at a conference table with a man and a woman.  The man, who has a goatee, says, <<<
Whoa!  Are you saying we need REVENUE to make profit??

Ouch!  I've got a headache on one side.

1997-05-23 * 
Dilbert stands behind Wally's desk.  Wally says, <<<
I wrote this labor-saving software.  Watch it do its thing.
>>> Dilbert and Wally watch the computer screen. Dilbert asks, <<<
Who can you tell if it's working?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
You don't see any labor happening around here, do you?
>>> 
1997-05-22 * 
Catbert stands at his desk and types, <<<
Any employee who uses the Internet for non-business purposes will be fired.
>>> Catbert types, <<<
And any employee who sits in a company chair while having a personal thought will be executed by security.
>>> Catbert smiles and thinks, <<<
The great thing about senseless, sadistic policies is that they don't require a lot of explanation.
>>> 
1997-05-21 * 
Dilbert stands at the Boss's desk and says, <<<
It is physically impossible for me to finish both of my projects on time.  Which one is more important?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Hmm . . . If I absolutely HAD to choose between them, I'd say . . . Do them both on time.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Wow.  When you do that with your arms, it creates the illusion that you're thinking.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
What you need is a third project.
>>> 
1997-05-20 * 
Dogbert stands behind Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
I was trying to decide if you're stupid or just very ignorant.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Then I thought, 'Whoa, Dogbert, you're being narrow-minded about this.'
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You could easily be both.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
It only LOOKS easy.

Wally, Alice and Dilbert sit at a table in a restaurant.  The waitress hands them the check and says, <<<
Thank you.  Please come again.
>>> The waitress thinks, <<<
After I'm dead.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
If we each put in twelve dollars, that will give her a healthy fourteen percent tip.
>>> Wally says, <<<
The service was excellent.  I'll put in a little extra.
>>>  Dilbert and Alice say, <<<
Me too.
>>> Dilbert counts the money and says, <<<
That gives us . . . Um . . . Only thirty-four dollars.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
One of us is a cheap, lying, unscrupulous weasel.
>>> They look at each other. Dilbert says, <<<
Or maybe the service was bad.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
She didn't smile enough.
>>>  Alice says, <<<
Same as last week.

My invention can detect human stupidity.

Then what does it do?

Why would it need to do anything else?

1997-05-13 * 
The caption says, <<<
Thermostat wars.
>>>  Wally stands behind Alice's desk wearing only a tie and his underwear.  He says, <<<
Be reasonable, Alice.  When it's warm enough for you, it's too hot for normal humans.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Logically, you could wear a sweater.  But there's nothing I can do to be less warm.  Therefore, you must compromise.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Did she buy the argument?

A man walks down the hall thinking, <<<
I am Carl, the cubicle dwellers' friend.

I travel from cubicle to cubicle to tell people how hard I'm working.
>>> Carl stands behind Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
I am working so-o-o-o hard.  Work, work, work.  It's all I do.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How is that possible?
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
You walk around all day with that coffee cup resting on your belly.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Does your job description say 'transport coffee cup on belly'?
>>> Carl walks away thinking, <<<
He's a terrible conversationalist.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
How many miles per gallon do you get?

Hypothetically, if you were downsized, how would the cup get around?
>>>  Carl thinks, <<<
What's wrong with these people?

The Boss, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
We did an industry survey to see how your salaries compared to the average.

We didn't get the numbers we hoped for, so we broadened the definition of 'our industry.'

I'm so happy to be in the industry of 'high technology, textile workers, teen-agers, and dead people.'"  Dilbert says, <<<
I feel overpaid.

What if this thing gets out of hand?

Dogbert sits on the couch.  Dilbert says, <<<
I calculated the total time that humans have waited for Web pages to load . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
It cancels out all the productivity gains of the information age.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Sometimes I think the Web is a big plot to keep people like me away from normal society.

Uh-oh, he's on to me.

I have a big, curly stick and I don't even know why.

We'll want to emphasize the things that make our product unique.
>>>  The man says, <<<
Good good.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Let's see . . . We have higher prices . . . Stale technology . . . Fewer features . . . And it's hard to use.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Can you work with that?
>>>  The man replies, <<<
Suddenly I don't feel so bad that we won't be using 100 percent recycled paper.
>>> 
1997-05-02 * 
The Boss tells Dilbert, <<<
I want you to work with our marketing people to design a product brochure.

Twenty percent of your pay will now be in the form of stock options instead of cash!

To get your stock options, simply sign this updated employment agreement.

Why does good news feel like a mugging?

The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  Wally says, <<<

Good news!  Our business plan is in complete disarray!

I'll handle this by telling your boss that you ratted him out to the Director of Human Resources.
>>> Alice says, <<<
I thought we had a 'Family Friendly' policy.

Alice peers into the Boss's office as she puts on her coat.  She says, <<<
I'm going home early because my kid is sick.

We do?

Is that why my family seems so friendly?
>>>  Alice replies, <<<
Maybe, but I'd test 'em for drugs.
>>> 
1997-04-22 * 
Dilbert tells Alice, <<<
This so-called 'Family Friendly' policy is like a tax on childless people.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
You get child-care; I get lower profit-sharing.  YOU get time off for family; I get to pick up your slack . . .
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm a victim, but in some strange way I'm enjoying it.
>>>  Alice makes a fist and rolls up her sleeve.  She says, <<<
Then you'll love this.

A woman points at a chart and says, <<<
My study shows that the companies with 'Family Friendly' policies have higher profits.
>>> Dilbert sits in the audience with Wally, Alice and other employees.  He raises his hand and says, <<<
Question: Do family policies cause high profits or do high profits simply camouflage the true costs of the policies?
>>> The woman says, <<<
We'll take a five-minute break so the married people can slap you for asking that.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Ouch!

Those are NOT all short words.

Your success at work depends on what you have in your hands when you walk around.

It doesn't look like you're heading for the fast track, Wally.

I don't know what got him - the boredom or the hard work.  But headcount is down one and the company has life insurance on him!

It looks like I found my 'Employee of the Week.'
>>> 
1997-04-16 * 
The Boss, Wally, Dilbert and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
There's been a lot of joking and grumbling since the company took out life insurance policies on all of you.

So we're having these catered lunch meetings to discuss your feelings.

Do you want the mad cow burger or the chicken bone surprise?
>>> 
1997-04-15 * 
Catbert and Wally sit at a table.  Catbert says, <<<
The company has taken out a life insurance policy on you, Wally.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
We pay the premiums and we collect the insurance when you die.
>>>  Wally looks at the policy and asks, <<<
Is this because I'm so valuable to the company?
>>> Catbert replies, <<<
It's because we think you'll be more valuable dead.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
This is exactly why I don't like cats.
>>> 
1997-04-14 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Alice, I need this ASAP.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
ASAP?  Does that stand for A Stupid-Acting Person, i.e., someone who ignores tasks until the deadline?
>>> The Boss walks away thinking, <<<
That was embarrassing.  I hope the other things I say don't mean anything.
>>> 
1997-04-13 * 
Dilbert enters the Boss's office.  He says, <<<
Here's my project plan as you requested.
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
Our team is already working day and night on other projects.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I assumed we'd give up eating, sleeping and bathing to fit this in.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
By the second week we'll be starving, delirious and stinking.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
We'll be like wild, unpredictable animals.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Specifically, we'd be like wild chipmunks.  None of us are very aggressive.
>>> Dilbert points to the proposal and says, <<<
This clip art represents us in week three as a pile of dead chipmunks.
>>> Wally asks Dilbert, <<<
Now he wants it in two weeks?
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Never mix sarcasm with good clip-art.
>>> 
1997-04-12 * 
Dilbert stands at the secretary's desk and says, <<<
Carol, I don't mean to be critical about the department phone list you put together . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But it's traditional to list people alphabetically, not sorted by phone number.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Because what possible use . . .?
>>>  Carol's telephone rings.  She looks at the display and says, <<<
Incoming call from . . . Let's see . . . It's Wally . . . I can ignore it.
>>> 
1997-04-11 * 
Dilbert shouts at Asok, <<<
I don't care what it 'looks' like on the org chart!  You're an intern, not my boss!
>>> The Boss pats Asok on the back and says, <<<
I just saw the new org chart.  Congratulations on your promotion, Asok!
>>> Asok and the Boss walk away from Dilbert's desk.  Asok says, <<<
Let's go make some strategies and pretend it's work!
>>>  The Boss whispers, <<<
Not so loud.  The L-U-S-E-R might hear.
>>>  Dilbert bangs his head on the desk. 
1997-04-10 * 
Asok stands behind Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
I notice that the new org chart has your box lower than before.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
It means nothing.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Perhaps.  But your box seems smallish.  And your reporting line brushes against my box.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
It means nothing.
>>> Asok says, <<<
No, I'm sure this means I'm your new boss.
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
I wonder if I killed someone in a previous life.
>>> 
1997-04-09 * 
Dilbert stands behind Wally's desk and says, <<<
The new org chart has my name lower than yours, but it doesn't mean anything.
>>> Dilbert shows Wally the chart and says, <<<
See?  It wouldn't all fit across the page.  It's just a graphical layout thing, that's all.
>>> Alice holds out her coffee mug and says, <<<
Hey, Dil-boy, put a head on this and fetch my mail.
>>>  Wally asks Dilbert, <<<
Are you asking me to be your mentor?
>>> 
1997-04-08 * 
Carol hands Dilbert a piece of paper and says, <<<
Here's the new org chart.  I had to rearrange the layout to make it fit.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why is my box lower than Alice's and Wally's?
>>>  Carol replies, <<<
It means nothing . . . Nothing at all.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Okay, who told you that every year I fish your Secretaries' Day card out of your trash and save it for next time?
>>>  Carol asks, <<<
What?
>>> 
1997-04-07 * 
Alice sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
Alice, your performance is good, but you must learn to deal with ambiguity.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
Did I just get blamed for your indecisive leadership?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
I'm not indecisive; I'm flexible.

That would explain how your head got where it is.

I hope to learn whether that thing on your head is a bad toupee, a dead animal, or a hideous freak of nature.

Can I call that 'general'?
>>> 
1997-04-04 * 
The Boss stands behind Alice's desk and says, <<<
I'm sending you to a training course that runs at night so you won't miss any work.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It might seem like an immoral abuse of my power, but I like to call it 'a mutual investment in your career.'
>>> Alice clenches her teeth and thinks, <<<
Must . . . Control . . . Fist . . . Of . . . Death . . .

A man and a woman stand outside Alice's cubicle.  Alice says, <<<
I hate to interrupt your loud conversation outside my cubicle . . .

But it you don't go away, I'll pound your inconsiderate head so far into your torso that you have to drop your pants to say hello.

Is there something wrong with that?

It's the subject of today's cartoon.

>>> 
1997-03-28 * 
The Boss sits at his desk thinking, <<<
Profits are down.  Morale is low.  What is the root problem?

It's got to be those anti-management cartoons the employees hang on their cubicle walls!
>>> The Boss looks at the comic strips hanging on Wally's cubicle.  The Boss says, <<<
And they aren't even funny.
>>>  Wally points to a strip and says, <<<
This one has our mission statement.
>>> 
1997-03-27 * 
Asok and Alice sit at a table eating lunch.  Alice says, <<<
When I was your age, we had things called 'promotions' and 'raises.'
>>> Alice continues, <<<
These days you can only get ahead by leaving the company for a year then coming back as a high-level manager.
>>> Asok says, <<<
So the theory must be that anyone who would return to this company is . . .
>>>  Alice answers, <<<
A moron.  Correct.
>>> 
1997-03-26 * 
The Boss sits at his desk and says, <<<
We plan too much.  From now on we'll have a bias for action.
>>> The Boss tells Asok and Wally, <<<
I want posters that proclaim our commitment to action.  And I want them soon!
>>> The Boss reads a poster, <<<
'Measure once.  Cut twice.'  I like it.
>>>  Wally tells Asok, <<<
Told you.
>>> 
1997-03-25 * 
Dilbert peers around the corner and tells Alice, <<<
Avoid the pointy-haired boss today.  I proved him wrong about something.
>>> Alice replies, <<<
Oh, terrific.  Now he's in a state of boss disequillibrium until he proves he's RIGHT about something.
>>> Wally and the Boss sit at a conference table.  Wally shouts, <<<
They're PHOTOCOPIES!  You don't need to proofread EACH ONE!
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
We'll see about that.
>>> 
1997-03-24 * 
The Boss stands behind Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
I studied your technical recommendation and decided it's impossible.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I already did it.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It will never work.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
It's working perfectly.
>>> The Boss points to the document and says, <<<
You spelled this word wrong.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's a number.
>>> 
1997-03-23 * 
Wally sits at his desk thinking, <<<
Whoa . . . I found a huge bug in our new software product.
>>> Wally thinks, <<<
I could alert the development team and work many hours of overtime to fix it . . .
>>> Wally thinks, <<<
Or I could surf over to my online brokerage service and buy stock in our competition.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Are you going to lunch?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
No, I have to do an analysis.
>>> Dilbert walks away thinking, <<<
When Wally works through lunch . . . It's time to buy stock in our competition.
>>> Dilbert tells Alice, <<<
Wally's working through lunch!
>>>  Alice says, <<<
Quick!  To the online brokerage service!
>>> The Boss reads the newspaper and thinks, <<<
Our competition is up ten points on no news.  We're up two, maybe from the industry halo effect.
>>> The Boss tells Alice and Wally, <<<
. . . Or maybe our new compensation plan is motivating smarter behavior.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I think you nailed it.
>>> 
1997-03-22 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at a table looking at a device.  Dilbert says, <<<
I've invented a quantum computer, capable of interacting with matter from other universes to solve complex equations.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
According to chaos theory, your tiny change to another universe will shift its destiny, possibly killing every inhabitant.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Shift happens.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Fire it up.
>>> 
1997-03-21 * 
Dilbert hands the Boss a card and says, <<<
It's called a 'Smart Card,' and we should build our next product to handle this sort of payment technology.
>>> Dilbert and Wally watch as the card jumps out of the Boss's hand. Dilbert says, <<<
I've never seen that happen.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
His body rejected the 'Smart Card.'
>>> 
1997-03-20 * 
Phil the Ruler of Heck tells Tina, <<<
You are guilty of being a technical writer with an unnatural attraction to an engineer.
>>> Phil leads Tina into Heck and says, <<<
It's not a major sin, so you only go to Heck.  I'm Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light.
>>> Phil leads Tina to a desk and says, <<<
Sit down and type, 'I proactively leverage my synergies,' a hundred times.
>>>  Tina screams, <<<
No-o-o!!!
>>> 
1997-03-19 * 
Tina and Alice sit at a table.  Tina says, <<<
Alice, I think I'm developing a crush on Dilbert.
>>> Tina asks, <<<
Is that so wrong?
>>> Alice replies, <<<
Apparently it is.
>>>  Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light, appears and says, <<<
I have a report of a tech writer desiring an engineer.
>>> 
1997-03-18 * 
Tina and Dilbert sit at a table eating lunch.  Tina says, <<<
I always fall for the wrong guys.  I'm a jerk magnet.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Tina, the turkey in your sandwich is already deceased.  You don't have to talk it to death.
>>> Tina clenches her teeth and her fists.  She thinks, <<<
I must disguise my arousal.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Hey, look!  We're eating exactly the same quantities for lunch!
>>> 
1997-03-17 * 
Tina the Tech Writer says to Dilbert, <<<
It's noon.  Let's grab a sandwich at the cafeteria.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Okay, but make sure that's ALL you grab.  I'd like to keep this on a professional basis.
>>> Dilbert adds, <<<
And I'll need to borrow five dollars.
>>>  Tina sighs and thinks, <<<
He's like a beautiful, untamed beast.
>>> 
1997-03-16 * 
The Boss says, <<<
You'll love your new assignment, Alice.
>>>  Alice thinks, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You're going to redesign all of our brochures!
>>> Alice replies, <<<
I'm an electrical engineer, not a graphic artist.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We can discuss your huge inadequacies during your annual review.
>>> Alice replies, <<<
I'm not inadequate.  I'm a highly skilled engineer.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
And yet you can't make brochures.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Okay, let me try to explain this in the simplest possible way . . .
>>> Alice continues, <<<
You . . . Are . . . An . . . Idiot.
>>> Alice sits at her desk thinking, <<<
The simplest possible explanation isn't always the best.
>>>  Wally stands behind her and says, <<<
Hey, it looks like a brochure, only uglier!
>>> 
1997-03-15 * 
Dilbert, who is wearing a bathrobe, tells Dogbert, <<<
I convinced my boss to let me telecommute.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
How?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Well, technically, I called in sick, which comes out of my time bank for total days off.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
So, technically, I'm working for nothing, but I'm ahead in principle.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
WAY ahead, now that stupidity is a principle.
>>> 
1997-03-14 * 
Dilbert approaches the Boss's desk and says, <<<
I'm here to negotiate for more telecommuting days.
>>> Ratbert sits on Dilbert's head.  Dilbert points to him and tells the Boss, <<<
My negotiating strategy is to have Ratbert say such illogical things that it drains your will to argue.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You can't work at home because you might do unproductive things there.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
I've lost my will to argue.
>>> 
1997-03-13 * 
Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
I need your help to negotiate with my boss for more telecommuting days.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I'm too logical to be a good negotiator.  You need someone who is relentlessly irrational.
>>> Dilbert tells Ratbert, <<<
Dogbert says you're an excellent negotiator, Ratbert.
>>>  Ratbert shouts, <<<
I'm insulted!!
>>> 
1997-03-12 * 
The Boss stands behind Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
I can't let you telecommute because then I wouldn't be able to manage you.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
You're managing me right now, and all it's doing is preventing me from working.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
And your point would be . . . ?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Just beyond your grasp.
>>> 
1997-03-11 * 
Asok stands behind Alice's desk and says, <<<
I am young and inexperienced, so please excuse this naive question, Alice . . .
>>> Asok continues, <<<
You spend hours every day 'doing e-mail.'  How does this contribute to net after-tax earnings?
>>> Asok stands behind Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
Today I learned that Alice can stuff my entire body into one shirt sleeve.
>>> 
1997-03-10 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk and thinks, <<<
And now for the most absurd activity of the week: the timecard.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
There's no project code for 'staring at the wall and fretting about the reorganization.'  I'll call it 'training.'
>>> Dilbert hands the timecard to Carol and says, <<<
Before I worked here I wasn't a thief or a liar.
>>>  Carol replies, <<<
You can't get that kind of training in school.
>>> 
1997-03-09 * 
Dilbert arrives at home and says to Dogbert, <<<
You're probably wondering how my day was.
>>>  Dogbert sits on the couch reading a magazine. Dilbert says, <<<
It was terrible . . . Until I did THIS!
>>>  Dilbert holds up a diagram. Dilbert sits down and explains, <<<
It all started when I deluded muself into thinking my opinions mattered.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I sprang into action like a cheetah on a trampoline!
>>>  Dilbert gets up and demonstrates. Dilbert continues, <<<
I drew lines and boxes and arrows for hours.  It was pure adrenaline.
>>> Dilbert shouts, <<<
Suddenly, trouble struck!  It wouldn't fit on one page!!
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
So I shrunk everything until it was totally unreadable.  And it fit!!
>>> Dilbert concludes, <<<
The moral of the story is that you don't have to feel bad just because you're totally worthless.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I'd mock you but the challenge is gone.
>>> 
1997-03-08 * 
Ratbert tells the Boss, <<<
Now that you're under my spell, I'd like to sit on your head and play bulldozer.
>>>  The Boss stares straight ahead and holds his arms out. Ratbert sits on the Boss's head and pulls on his hair.  He says, <<<
Make some engine noises with your lips!
>>>  Ratbert laughs as the Boss makes noises. Alice asks Dilbert and Wally, <<<
Do you think our consultant has too much power?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Nah.  He's barely moving that file cabinet.
>>> 
1997-03-07 * 
Wally tells Dilbert, <<<
Our boss has fallen under the spell of a consultant.
>>>  The Boss walks by with his arms outstretched and a zombie-like look on his face.  He says, <<<
Must . . . Make assumptions.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Must . . . write . . large checks to consultant . . . because . . . employees . . . are . . . morons.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Just because we pay inexperienced strangers to tell us how to do our jobs, that doesn't mean we're morons!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Yeah!  It's a coincidence.
>>> 
1997-03-06 * 
The Boss sits at a table with his arms outstretched.  He says, <<<
I am under your consulting spell.
>>>  Ratbert asks, <<<
Really?
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Your overly complicated matrices and diagrams have convinced me of your intellectual superiority.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I am afraid to act without your approval.
>>>  Ratbert asks, <<<
Did I say you could put your arms up like that?
>>> 
1997-03-05 * 
Ratbert stands in front of a dry erase board and says, <<<
Your strategy options can be shown in this matrix.
>>> Dilbert and the Boss sit at a conference table listening to the presentation.  Ratbert continues, <<<
The four boxes are 'Something . . . Something . . . Some other thing and whatever.'
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
In phase two I hope to turn this matrix into concentric circles with labels and arrows.
>>>  The Boss thinks, <<<
I'm under the consultant's spell.
>>> 
1997-03-04 * 
Alice, Ratbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  Ratbert says, <<<
'Wal-Mart's' business strategy was very successful.  You can learn from their example.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
Does their strategy involve sitting around and making irrelevant comparisons to other companies?
>>> Ratbert replies, <<<
All I know for sure is that they don't let rats try on all the pantyhose in the store.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Good strategy.
>>> 
1997-03-03 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
Ratbert, I'm going back into the consulting business and I need you to be my engagement manager.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
You'll seem very smart if you randomly combine the words on this list and make many references to 'Wal-Mart.'
>>> Ratbert sits at a conference table with Dilbert and the Boss.  Ratbert says, <<<
It's like 'Wal-Mart.'  Migrate your value into the white spaces of the ecosystem.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Wow!  That's one smart rat!
>>> 
1997-03-02 * 
Dilbert stands in the bedroom tying his tie.  He tells Dogbert, <<<
Our new CEO will be announced today, Dogbert.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Rumor has it that they picked a tall caucasian male with no experience in our industry.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I can't wait to hear the bizarre logic behind this choice.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I like your necktie.  Is it new?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Shut up.
>>> A man stands at a podium and says, <<<
Our new CEO has never worked in our industry, but that's exactly what we were looking for . . .
>>> The man continues, <<<
. . . Because we wanted a CEO who doesn't know what can't be done!
>>> The men prepare to shake hands, but the CEO offers his left hand.  The man whispers, <<<
Other hand . . . Other hand.
>>>  The CEO asks, <<<
Why?
>>> Dilbert says to Wally and Alice, <<<
He looks a bit overqualified.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I really took the wrong approach on my resume.
>>> 
1997-03-01 * 
Dilbert, Wally, the Boss and Alice sit at a conference table.  Wally says, <<<
As you requested, I have learned to 'do more with less.'
>>> Wally continues, <<<
I'm doing more unnecessary work, with less planning, less intelligence, and less guilt.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I hate the first staff meeting after budget cuts.
>>>  Wally adds, <<<
And less career aspiration, too!
>>> 
1997-02-28 * 
Dogbert stands on the Boss's desk and says, <<<
Dilbert asked me to speak to you about the project plan you created without his input.
>>> Dogbert screams, <<<
It's impossible, you arrogant baboon!!!
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Lean over here so I can slap you.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
I'm having flashbacks to my honeymoon.
>>> 
1997-02-27 * 
Dilbert tells the Boss, <<<
I've heard that some primitive cultures had no mathematical concept of 'zero.'
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Sometimes I think you're like that when I tell you I have zero time left for additional work.
>>> The caption says, <<<
The conversation went downhill from there.
>>>  Dilbert screams, <<<
No, that's 'Zorro.'  You're NOT like Zorro.
>>> 
1997-02-26 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk working and talking on the phone at the same time.  The Boss asks, <<<
Have you set up our off-site meeting so we can talk about how overworked you are?
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I was thinking we should invite the reast of the staff, too.  We can discuss our mission statement, maybe have a sack race.
>>> The Boss adds, <<<
Did you know that if you're a state trooper, you can shoot any animal that's been hit by a car?
>>> 
1997-02-25 * 
Dilbert tells the Boss, <<<
I'm totally frazzled.  There simply isn't enough time in the day to meet my upcoming deadlines.
>>>  Dilbert's hair and clothes are disheveled. The Boss says, <<<
Let's have an all-day meeting off-site so I can explain why the deadlines are so important.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So, your theory is that I'll have more time in the day if you explain something I already know?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
I don't have a lot of tools here.
>>> 
1997-02-24 * 
Dilbert sits at a conference table with several people.  A salesman tells them, <<<
I had to promise the customer we could build the thing in a month even though you said it was impossible.
>>> The salesperson continues, <<<
I'll solve the timing problem by shifting blame to engineering while spending the huge bonus I got for the sale.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Your planning has improved.
>>>  The man closes his eyes and says, <<<
Beginning blame transfer now . . .
>>>  The other people at the table growl. 
1997-02-23 * 
The Boss, Wally, Dilbert and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss thinks, <<<
I dread this part of the staff meeting.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Let's go around the table and describe our accomplishments for the week.  Wally?
>>> Wally replies, <<<
It was another week of amazing success in Wallyville.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
On Monday I realized my left bun had fallen asleep.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
I was shocked.  The 'Boys' had always worked as a team before.
>>> Wally leans to the side and continues, <<<
Thinking quickly, I shifted my weight to my right bun and hoped for the best.
>>> Alice says, <<<
That's your left side, not your right.
>>> Wally replies, <<<
That's the other thing; apparently the boys switched sides sometime during the night.
>>>  The Boss covers his face with his hands. 
1997-02-22 * 
The Boss tells Dilbert, <<<
I've decided to abandon logic and manage by cliches.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It won't be easy, but I'll take it one bird at a time.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
And remember, the customer is always right-handed.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
This is actually an improvement.
>>> 
1997-02-21 * 
Dilbert sits at a conference table wearing handcuffs.  Dogbert sits next to him.  A lawyer says, <<<
You're accused of stealing a computer.  We'll reduce the charge to 'lewd conduct with appliances' if you'll plead guilty.
>>> Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
That sounds fair.  People will understand it's just a plea bargain.
>>> Wally enters the office kitchen and asks Dilbert, <<<
Would you like a minute alone with 'Mr. Coffee'?
>>> 
1997-02-20 * 
Dilbert wears a black hooded suit and carries a PC.  He thinks, <<<
The bold commando stealthily relocates his PC at night, thus thwarting burdensome union rules.
>>> A security guard pulls a gun on Dilbert and says, <<<
Freeze, miscreant.
>>> Dilbert stands in a jail cell with two large men.  He thinks, <<<
I hope this works.
>>>  One of the convicts says, <<<
You don't look like Johnny Cash to me.
>>> 
1997-02-19 * 
Dilbert carries a monitor.  A man says, <<<
Hey, that's a union job.  Put it down or I'll file a grievance.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm only moving it ten feet.  If I wait for a union person, I'll be unable to do my job for a week.
>>>  The man says, <<<
Watch me not care.
>>> Dilbert wears a hooded black suit and holds a grappling hook.  Dogbert says, <<<
If anyone sees you move the PC tonight, try saying you're Johnny Cash.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Maybe I should just use the elevator.
>>> 
1997-02-18 * 
Asok, Dilbert and Alice sit at a conference table.  Asok says, <<<
I'd like to start the meeting with a whiny, unanswerable question.
>>> Asok shouts, <<<
Why can't anyone make a decision around here?!
>>> Alice says, <<<
That was good.
>>>  Dilbert pats Asok on the back and sniff emotionally.  He says, <<<
My little intern is all grown up.
>>> 
1997-02-17 * 
The Boss sits at his desk and tells Dilbert, <<<
You didn't give me your five-year budget forecast.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
You didn't ask for one.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It was discussed at the project review meeting.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
You didn't invite me to that meeting.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Did you accomplish ANYTHING this week?
>>>  Dilbert answers, <<<
I trained the bats who live in my cubicle to juggle mushrooms.
>>> 
1997-02-16 * 
Alice, Dilbert and Wally grumble as they enter a leadership seminar. The instructor asks, <<<
What would you call a manager who motivates employees to work fourteen hours a day?
>>> Alice answers, <<<
A filthy sadist.
>>>  Dilbert answers, <<<
Pointy-haired imbecile.
>>> The instructor says, <<<
Umm . . . No . . . That's not what I'm looking for.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I think he means what do we call him to his face.
>>> Alice, Dilbert and Wally answer in unison, <<<
Leader.
>>> The instructor says, <<<
Right!  And what do you call someone who can make unpopular decisions again and again?
>>> Someone replies, <<<
A filthy sadist?
>>>  Another participant says, <<<
Wait, it might be another trick question.
>>>  The instructor thinks, <<<
I hate training engineers.
>>> 
1997-02-15 * 
Carol tells Dilbert, <<<
This is Wendy, my new secretary.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I didn't know secretaries could have secretaries.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Now will you have time to process my pay increase?  It's been on your desk for three months.
>>> Carol and Wendy laugh.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Here's another case where more is not better.
>>> 
1997-02-14 * 
Dilbert tells the Boss, <<<
My raise didn't go through because your secretary didn't do the paperwork.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I demand that you initiate disciplinary actions against her!
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
I'll try, but . . .
>>> The Boss stands behind Carol's desk and asks, <<<
Carol, could you get me one of those disciplinary action forms?
>>>  Carol replies, <<<
Sure, right after my ski trip to hell.
>>> 
1997-02-13 * 
Dilbert asks the Boss's secretary, <<<
Carol, do you know why my raise hasn't showed up in my pay yet?
>>>  Carol replies, <<<
I haven't submitted the paperwork.
>>> Carol says, <<<
I'm too busy to do it.  Maybe you should talk to my boss about getting me a secretary.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Carol, YOU are the secretary.
>>>  Carol replies, <<<
That'll cost you another month.
>>> 
1997-02-12 * 
Carol, the Boss's secretary, tells him, <<<
I need my own secretary.  I'm too busy to help you unless I get some support.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Too busy?  You haven't done any work for me in six months.
>>> Carol says, <<<
Oh, suddenly this is about YOU?
>>> 
1997-02-11 * 
Alice tells Dilbert, <<<
Today I'll find out how big my bonus will be.
>>> Alice continues, <<<
After all the work I did on that project, I'm thinking four digits, maybe five.
>>> Later, Dilbert asks, <<<
How many digits?
>>>  Alice replies, <<<
I used one on each hand.
>>> 
1997-02-10 * 
Dilbert stands behind Wally's desk and says, <<<
I need a bullet point for your monthly accomplishments, Wally.
>>> Wally replies, <<<
Put me down for, 'Leveraged synergy across all technology platforms.'
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That was your accomplishment last month.
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
It's more of a journey than a destination.
>>> 
1997-02-09 * 
The caption says, <<<
Job interview.
>>>  Wally sits across from the interviewer's desk.  The man says, <<<
We're looking for a special kind of employee, Wally.
>>> The man continues, <<<
Specifically, we like people with low self-esteem.
>>> The man continues, <<<
That way we can bully them into working unpaid overtime.
>>> The man asks, <<<
Do you think you're insecure enough to work here?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
Let me put it this way.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Sometimes I pretend to choke in the cafeteria . . .
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Then when someone performs the Heimlich maneuver on me I spin around suddenly . . .
>>> Wally concludes, <<<
Just to get a hug.
>>> Alice, Dilbert and Wally sit at a table eating lunch.  Alice asks, <<<
Did he really say you're over-qualified?
>>>  Wally pretends to choke on his food. 
1997-02-08 * 
The Boss thinks, <<<
My old slogan was, 'Work smarter not harder.'
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
But people kept leaving for companies that pay more for less work.
>>> The Boss stands behind Alice and says, <<<
Work like a frightened idiot!
>>>  Alice says, <<<
Catchy.
>>> 
1997-02-07 * 
Dilbert lies on the couch and Dogbert stands on the armrest.  Dogbert looks at a stopwatch and says, <<<
Don't mind the stopwatch.  I'm testing the theory that people get dumber every minute.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's not so simple, Dogbert.  You also have to consider my 'emotional intelligence,' which is defined in a book I haven't read.
>>> Dogbert stops the watch and says, <<<
Twelve seconds.
>>>  Dilbert sits up and says angrily, <<<
Give me that watch, you hog!
>>> 
1997-02-06 * 
Alice sits across from Catbert's desk.  She says, <<<
I was so good at my job that I never needed to bother my boss, but he gave me a low rating because he didn't see me struggling.
>>> Catbert replies, <<<
I must refer to my human resources binders to see how to deal with this.
>>> Catbert looks at a bookcase filled with binders.  Most of the binders are labeled "Downsize" and a few are labeled <<<
Hire Losers.
>>> 
1997-02-05 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Alice, I gave you a low performance ranking because you haven't bothered me all year.
>>> The Boss explains, <<<
Logically, if your job were difficult and important, you would have brought me many issues to resolve.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
Can you think of ANY other reason I might not bring you issues?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Yeah, laziness.  But I gave you the benefit of a doubt.
>>> 
1997-02-04 * 
Dilbert's mother sits on the couch drinking tea and Dilbert sits on the chair across from her.  Dilbert says, <<<
I spent all week tweaking HTML for my Intranet Web page.  You should see it, Mom.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I converted the video of my birth into an MPEG file.  Anyone behind the fire wall can view it.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
You should hear the nickname they have for you at work!
>>>  Dilbert's mother replies, <<<
You should hear the one I have for you right now.
>>> 
1997-02-03 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Every department is required to create a Web page for our internal network.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It should include enough information to be difficult to maintain, but not so much that it's useful.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
As a security precaution, we'll make it too dull and unorganized to read.
>>>  Wally asks, <<<
Is pornography in or out?
>>> 
1997-02-02 * 
Dilbert says to the Boss's secretary, <<<
Carol, could you check our pointy-haired boss's calendar?
>>>  Carol grumbles. Dilbert explains, <<<
We'd like to schedule a celebration for the engineers who got patents.
>>>  Carol grumbles. Dilbert says, <<<
We're all available on the sixth, ninth, twentieth and the twenty-first.
>>> Carol says, <<<
I'll schedule it for the tenth.  That's the only day he can do it.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Um . . . None of the engineers can make it on the tenth.
>>> Carol says, <<<
It's not a perfect world.
>>> Wally asks Dilbert, <<<
When's the patent celebration?
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Shut up.

We should do this more often.

Yeah, I like cake.

1997-02-01 * 
Dilbert and Wally stand in front of the coffee machine.  Wally says, <<<
The more work I do, the more I'm given.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
It doesn't pay to be a talented and hard-working employee.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How's it pay to be YOU?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
Not bad on an hourly basis.
>>> 
1997-01-31 * 
Alice, Asok the Intern and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  Asok says, <<<
I installed calendar software on our network.
>>> Asok continues, <<<
Now you can see everyone's schedule and easily set up meetings.
>>> Dilbert tells Alice, <<<
I say we grab him and apply some cubicle justice.
>>>  Alice points to the monitor and replies, <<<
Good idea, but I'm in meetings until the year 3006.
>>> 
1997-01-30 * 
Ratbert stands on a desk looking at a glass of water.  He says, <<<
A pessimist says the glass is half empty.  An optimist says it's half full.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Did you put your lips on my glass again?
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
And the engineer says . . .
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
It's a good thing I put half of my water in a redundant glass.
>>> 
1997-01-29 * 
Dilbert hands the Boss a document and says, <<<
As you requested, here is a schedule of all future unplanned network outages.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I took the initiative to include a schedule of all future sick days, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and hurricanes.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
This is the point when you realize how stupid your request was and we have a good laugh.
>>>  The Boss reads the document and looks shocked.  He asks, <<<
Does CNN know about this?
>>> 
1997-01-28 * 
The Boss tells Dilbert, <<<
The network went down and I lost my work.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
The server crashed.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
From now on, I want advanced notice of any unplanned outages.
>>> The Boss adds, <<<
And I need it yesterday.
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
I used to think that was just a figure of speech.
>>> 
1997-01-27 * 
Catbert stands on a desk and says, <<<
We've decided to lower your base salary, Wally.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
I realize this will be a hardship.  But if you hand me your necktie I'll show you why this is being done.
>>> Dilbert asks Wally, <<<
What did he say was the reason?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
'Because I can.'"  Wally's tie has been shredded. 
1997-01-26 * 
Dilbert and his mother stand in the kitchen.  Dilbert asks, <<<
What do you want for your birthday this year, Mom?
>>> Dilbert's mother replies, <<<
Oh, nothing.  I have everything I need.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Oh, c'mon.  There must be something you want.
>>>  His mother replies, <<<
Well, one thing, but it's silly.
>>> They sit in chairs.  Dilbert says, <<<
You just name it.
>>>  His mom replies, <<<
Okay.
>>> Dilbert's mother says, <<<
I'd like a home entertainment theatre with a fifty-inch screen, 'Thx' Surround Sound and a 600 KBPS satellite link to the Net so I can view adult pictures during the commercials.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
I was thinking more along the lines of a new toaster oven.
>>> Dilbert's mother says, <<<
Oh, that's exciting.  I'll put it next to my other one and watch them fight it out.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
There's a real dark side to the information age.
>>>  Dilbert's mother says, <<<
Oh, and about the gift of life I gave you; you're welcome.
>>> 
1997-01-25 * 
Alice, the Boss, Wally and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
The results of the employee survey have been tabulated.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
As always, employees say they are underpaid, blah, blah, blah, and management is incompetent.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
And your bizarre, unworldly response will be?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Everyone gets a travel alarm clock with the company logo!
>>> 
1997-01-24 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I put you in for a compliment, Alice.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It's not automatic.  The application must be approved by the executive review committee.
>>> Three members of the executive review committee sit at a conference table.  A woman says, <<<
I don't think so.
>>>  A man replies, <<<
We don't want them to think compliments are an entitlement.
>>> 
1997-01-23 * 
Alice sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
Don't mention any problems when you do your presentation to senior management, Alice.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
They might try to solve the problems during the meeting.  That would be a disaster.
>>> Alice tells Dilbert, <<<
As far as I can tell, every layer of management exists for the sole purpose of warning us about the layer above.
>>>  Dilbert akss, <<<
Are you saying they have a purpose?
>>> 
1997-01-22 * 
Catbert stands at his desk and types, <<<
Effective immediately, the company will no longer allow time off for the death of a family member.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
This 'family friendly' policy will remove your incentive to extend vacations by killing relatives.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
And more good news: we're canceling your life insurance so your family won't try to snuff you out either.
>>> 
1997-01-21 * 
Wally tells the Boss, <<<
I can't sign this performance review!  It's full of alleged misdeeds that you invented to lower my rating!
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Yes, but I think it reflects the sort of things you MIGHT do.  I had to make all the reviews fit a bell curve.
>>> Wally screams, <<<
I am NOT selling crack from my cubicle!!!
>>> 
1997-01-20 * 
The Boss tells Wally, <<<
Bad news on your performance review, Wally.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Everyone performed the same.  But I'm required to rank the group on a bell curve.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I had to make up some flaws to move you down the curve.  Here's a pen.  Sign it.
>>>  Wally reads the review, <<<
Employee does not wash hands after using the restroom.
>>> 
1997-01-19 * 
The caption says, <<<
Office obstacle course.
>>>  Dilbert walks down the hall.  He sees another man and thinks, <<<
Uh-oh, it's Phil.  I never returned his call.  Walk faster.

Yes!!
>>> Dilbert peers around a corner and thinks, <<<
Uh-oh, it's an unpleasant co-worker who wants to be my friend.
>>> Dilbert walks behind Wally and a woman and thinks, <<<
The clever engineer blends with the herd to avoid detection.
>>> Dilbert stands by Alice's desk and thinks, <<<
Uh-oh, I owe Alice some information.
>>>  Alice's phone rings. As Alice answers the phone, Dilbert runs by her desk and thinks, <<<
Yes!!
>>> Dilbert looks behind him and thinks, <<<
There's only one more obstacle between me and blissful productivity.
>>>  The Boss comes around the corner. Dilbert runs into the Boss and shouts, <<<
My whole day is ruined!!!
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
It looks like you need a one-on-one coaching session.
>>> 
1997-01-18 * 
Bob the Dinosaur and Dogbert sit on the couch.  Dogbert says, <<<
Businesses used to be like Christianity; if you were faithful and obedient, you could obtain bliss in the afterlife of retirement.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Now it's more of a reincarnation model.  If the worker learns enough in his current job, he can progress to a higher level of employment elsewhere.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
These analogies aren't working for you, are they, Bob?
>>>  Bob replies, <<<
My hope is that one day I will biodegrade and become 'WD-40' oil.
>>> 
1997-01-17 * 
The Boss hands Tina the Tech Writer a document.  He says, <<<
Here's you annual performance review, Tina.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I focused on your performance for the past two weeks because I don't remember anything farther back.
>>> Tina screams, <<<
I was on VACATION for the past two weeks!!!
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
No time to chat.  I need to spread some motivation over here.
>>> 
1997-01-16 * 
Dilbert stands in a room filled with electronic equipment.  A voice coming from a monitor says, <<<
You have been chosen as Bill Gates' towel boy.  But first you must answer this quiz.
>>> The voice continues, <<<
You're in a room with three monkeys.  One has a banana, one has a stick, one has nothing.  Which primate is the smartest?
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Um . . .
>>> Dilbert sits on the couch and Dogbert sits on the backrest.  Dogbert says, <<<
I guess the successful towel boys know that humans are primates too.
>>>  DIlbert says angrily, <<<
Stupid trick question.
>>> 
1997-01-15 * 
Dogbert and Dilbert sit on the armrest of the couch.  Dogbert says, <<<
. . . So you didn't read the software license and you inadvertently agreed to be Bill Gates' towel boy in his huge new house.  When do we move?
>>> They hear a rumbling noise and the house shakes. A machine crashes through the wall and says, <<<
Prepare for assimilation.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
The house has come for me.
>>> 
1997-01-14 * 
Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
I didn't read all of the shrink-wrap license agreement on my new software until after I opened it.
>>>  Beads of sweat fly off Dilbert's forehead and he pulls nervously at his tie. Dilbert continues, <<<
Apparently I agreed to spend the rest of my life as a towel boy in Bill Gates' new mansion.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Call your lawyer.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Too late.  He opened the software yesterday.  Now he's Bill Gates' laundry boy.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
It must be dangerous for lawyers to iron pants.  They'd always have one hand in a pocket.
>>> 
1997-01-13 * 
The Boss, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  Wally says, <<<
This week I did equal amounts of work and anti-work.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
For every unit of work I did, I generated an equal amount of unnecessary work for co-workers.  I figure I broke even.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Wally, come see me after the staff meeting.
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
Oh, great.  You're driving me into negative territory.
>>> 
1997-01-12 * 
The caption says, <<<
Buying a car.
>>>  Dilbert sits across from a car salesman's desk.  The salesman says, <<<
You're one tough negotiator.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Thanks.
>>> The salesman says, <<<
It only took you four hours to get me all the way down to the manufacturer's suggested retail price.
>>> The salesman cries, <<<
There's no profit left!!  My family will go hungry!!
>>>  The man bawls. The salesman stops crying and says, <<<
Sorry.  I assume you want the rust inhibitor coating for only $500.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Um . . .Yeah.  Rust is bad.
>>> The man jumps up and shouts, <<<
Yes!!  Ka-ching ka-ching!
>>> The salesman says, <<<
Sorry.  We also have an invisible spray that protects against scurvy and tax audits.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Well . . . Okay.
>>> The salesman says, <<<
Initial here if you want your airbag to be full of fresh aspen air instead of gravel.
>>>  Dilbert reads the contract and says, <<<
Only $600.
>>> Back at home, Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
And the lease terms are engraved on this free hood ornament!
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Be glad they didn't install it.
>>> 
1997-01-11 * 
Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
Wish me luck.  I'm off to get my performance review.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Have you been napping?  You've got a bad case of keyboard face.
>>>  Wally has several indentations on his cheek. The Boss asks Wally, <<<
What's wrong with your face?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
I have Qwertytis.  It's from working too hard.
>>> 
1997-01-10 * 
Wally tells Dilbert, <<<
. . . So my Elbonian mail-order bride turns out to be a pig with a wig.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
What a rip-off.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You're taking this well.  I'd be mad if I paid for a bride and then I had to pay to send her back.
>>>  They sit down at the table to eat lunch. Dilbert says, <<<
You did send her back . . .
>>>  Wally offers Dilbert a sandwich and says, <<<
B.L.T.?
>>> 
1997-01-09 * 
Wally opens an air mail package.  He thinks, <<<
My Elbonian mail-order bride has arrived.
>>> Wally unties the package and thinks, <<<
I must keep my expectations low to avoid any disappointment.
>>> A pig wearing a dress and a wig stands in the box.  She says, <<<
Where's the ladies sty?  I desperately need to powder my snout.
>>> 
1997-01-08 * 
Alice says, <<<
Hey, Wally.  I hear you're getting an Elbonian mail-order bride!
>>> Alice says, <<<
It's so sad and pathetic, yet so funny!  I feel sorry for her already!
>>> Alice laughs.  Wally says, <<<
And people ask why I gave up on local girls.
>>> 
1997-01-07 * 
Wally and Dilbert sit at a table eating lunch.  Wally says, <<<
My Elbonian mail-order bride will arrive any day now.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Why don't you know the exact date?
>>> Wally replies, <<<
Because they're sending her by mail.  I wasn't willing to pay for overnight delivery.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
She's one lucky gal.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I'll probably keep her in the garage.  It has a sink.
>>> 
1997-01-06 * 
Wally tells Dilbert, <<<
I've decided to end my loneliness by getting a mail-order bride from Elbonia.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
The photos were grainy, but the advertisement guarantees that she's cute.
>>> In Elbonia, a man holds a telephone and tells another man, <<<
Blonde.
>>>  The man reaches into a box of wigs and selects a blonde wig. A pig wearing a dress stands next to him. 
1997-01-05 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Alice, I'd like your input on something.
>>> Alice thinks, <<<
Uh-oh . . . My intuition is activating the fist of death.  Must . . . Control . . .
>>> They sit at a conference table and the Boss says, <<<
Our corporate culture is bad.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I'm trying to find the cause.
>>> Alice replies, <<<
Well, obviously the problem isn't caused by managers who have no self-awareness . . . So what could it be?
>>> Alice continues, <<<
The culture problem must be coming from the other direction.  Some EMPLOYEE must be causing this problem!
>>> Alice continues, <<<
I think it's the guy in the mail room.  His bad culture is infecting the rest of us.
>>> The Boss stands in the mail room.  A man says, <<<
If this is about that conference room full of mail, I don't know how it got there.
>>> 
1997-01-04 * 
Wally, Asok and the Boss sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Our new corporate policy is that all employees must use the products we sell.
>>> Asok screams and shouts, <<<
What have we done to deserve this??!!!
>>> Asok asks Wally, <<<
So you're saying that many of these policies are NOT intended to be punishments?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
You get used to it after you lose your will to live.
>>> 
1997-01-03 * 
Dilbert carries a stack of documents.  He tells the Boss, <<<
Per your instructions, my request for a million dollars has been broken into one hundred business cases.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Each one is for ten thousand dollars, which is your exact level of approval authority.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I meant I can approve anything UNDER ten thousand dollars . . . So if you wouldn't mind . . .
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Killing you?  No, I wouldn't mind a bit.
>>> 
1997-01-02 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
You need a million dollars but I only have authority to sign for up to ten thousand.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Break it into a hundred separate business cases.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Thank you for your value-added management support.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
It was nothing.
>>> 
1997-01-01 * 
Catbert peers into Wally's cubicle and says, <<<
Hey, Wally, I pulled some strings to get you moved to a window cubicle.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
It's for my own benefit.  I plan to take naps while lying in the sun on top of your head.
>>> Catbert sleeps on Wally's head.  Wally says, <<<
Every day this job teaches me I can get used to anything.
>>> 
1996-12-31 * 
Dilbert sits at a conference table with a man and a woman.  He is wearing a wrinkled suit. The other people stare at Dilbert. Dilbert says, <<<
When I bought this suit, it said 'wrinkle-free' on the wrapper.

The wrapper?
>>> 
1996-12-30 * 
Dilbert stands at the reservation desk in a hotel.  He says, <<<
No rooms??  If the Pope showed up, would you have a room for HIM?
>>>  The clerk replies, <<<
Yes.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Okay, then give me HIS room!
>>>  He thinks, <<<
I am so clever.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Let's see you squirm out of THAT logic, weasel-girl.
>>>  The Pope stands behind Dilbert. 
1996-12-29 * 
Dogbert answers the phone and says, <<<
This is Dogbert.  How may I abuse you?
>>> The Boss sits at his desk and says into the telephone, <<<
I need to move my cursor to the right but my mouse is at the edge of the mousepad.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Have you tried rebooting without saving your files?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Yeah, several times.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Have you tried moving your desk?
>>> The Boss pushes his desk. The Boss says, <<<
It didn't work.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
You need my $800 mousepad upgrade.
>>> The Boss asks Carol, <<<
What account does this get charged to?
>>>  Carol replies, <<<
'Idiot Expense,' just like everything else.
>>> 
1996-12-28 * 
An attendant says to Dilbert, <<<
This taxi is yours.  Here's a description of how he'll cheat you.
>>> Dilbert sits in the back of the taxi cab and says, <<<
It says you'll be running the meter despite the flat rate.  Then you'll feign poor language skills when I question you.
>>>  The driver looks crazy. Dilbert says, <<<
I can't fault your efficiency, though.
>>>  The driver hits a bicycle and a pedestrian. 
1996-12-27 * 
Dilbert sits in a taxi cab holding his suitcase.  A doorman opens the door and says, <<<
Welcome to the hotel, allow me to touch your bag so you'll feel obligated to tip me.
>>> Dilbert hugs his bag and walks past three bellmen.  He thinks, <<<
I've got to make it through the gauntlet of bag-losing hotel zombies.
>>>  The hotel employees think about money as they reach for his bag. Dilbert stands at the counter and says to a woman, <<<
No room?!!  I have a reservation!!
>>>  The clerk replies, <<<
Oh, that's original.
>>>  A bellhop reaches for Dilbert's luggage. 
1996-12-26 * 
Dilbert stands at the Happy Airlines check-in counter.  He hands the ticket agent a sack and says, <<<
This bag contains all the mail you've sent me about my 'Often Flier' status.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I'll trade everything in the bag for a seat upgrade.  I'm currently assigned to an overhead bin.
>>>  The woman looks in the bag and says, <<<
Okay.
>>> Dilbert hands his boarding pass to an agent and thinks, <<<
Whew!  Disaster has been averted.
>>>  The man standing behind Dilbert holds two infants.  He asks the woman behind him, <<<
Are you guys going to the colicky baby convention too?
>>> 
1996-12-25 * 
Dogbert sits on the dresser watching Dilbert pack.  Dilbert closes a suitcase and tells Dogbert, <<<
This suitcase is the decoy.
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
While the airline is distracted trying to lose the decoy, I'll sneak aboard with this emergency carry-on bag.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
What if they try to make you eat their food?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Fake vomit.  They'll think I already ate.
>>> 
1996-12-24 * 
Dilbert sits at a table with stacks of brochures in front of him.  Dogbert stands on the table and says, <<<
This is Marilyn Vos Savant, the smartest human alive.
>>>  A woman stands behind Dogbert. Dogbert says, <<<
She will help you understand your airline 'Often Flier' program.
>>>  Marilyn looks at a brochure and says, <<<
I'm stumped.

After this, could you tell me which phone company saves me the most money?

My brain's trying to escape; you scared it.

1996-12-23 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk and says into the telephone, <<<
I'd like a direct flight . . . Aisle seat . . . And an upgrade to first class if possible.
>>> The airline ticket agent replies, <<<
The best I can do is to put you in an overhead luggage bin . . . With one stop in North Korea.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Is it non-smoking?
>>>  The ticket salesperson replies, <<<
That depends on how accurate the anti-aircraft fire is.
>>> 
1996-12-22 *

Today is your ten-year anniversary, Wally.
>>> Carol says, <<<
Pick a gift from the service anniversary catalog.
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Is there a ceremony?
>>>  Carol replies, <<<
Yeah.  We just had it.
>>> Wally asks, <<<
May I say a few words?
>>>  Carol replies, <<<
Anywhere but here.
>>> Wally looks through the catalog and tells Dilbert, <<<
The selection of gifts at the ten-year level is somewhat meager.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The golf ball is nice.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I'm leaning toward the 'I'm with stupid' shirt.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
All I see is a blank shirt.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
It comes with a fabric pen.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I can almost feel the love our company has for us.
>>>  Wally asks, <<<
What do you mean 'us'?
>>> 
1996-12-21 * 
Ratbert sits at a desk.  Asok stands behind him and asks, <<<
I am only an intern, but may I make a suggestion?
>>> Asok says, <<<
The Elbonian database system you're installing for our company will never work . . . Unless I rewrite the entire thing with just six keystrokes . . . Done.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
I thought this was only possible in bad movies.
>>>  Asok says, <<<
Hey, let's hack into NATO's system.  I can guess their password in three tries.
>>> 
1996-12-20 * 
Ratbert and Dilbert sit at a table.  Ratbert says, <<<
. . . Then we'll turn off the existing computer systems and fire up the new one.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What if the new system doesn't work on the first try?  Won't the economic impact be devastating?
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
Let me check my contract . . . Nope.  I get paid exactly the same.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Yeah, same here.
>>> 
1996-12-19 * 
Ratbert leans on Wally's monitor and says, <<<
As a consultant, I earn $150 per hour even when I'm unproductive.

I can earn 42 cents by wiggling my furry little behind for ten seconds.
>>> Ratbert shouts, <<<
C'mon, count with me!!!
>>>  Wally tells Dilbert, <<<
When I imagine my ideal career, it's never like this.
>>> 
1996-12-18 *

I don't know much about computers so I compensate by being highly exuberant.

Yes!!  Yes!!  Computers!!  Wahoo!!!

Hey look!  It's not my fault; it's some guy named 'general protection.'"  Alice reaches for Ratbert and says, <<<
It's time for your flying lessons.
>>> 
1996-12-17 * 
The Boss, Alice, Ratbert, Wally and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
We're going to replace our computer support systems with the Elbonian database product.
>>> The Boss gestures toward Ratbert and continues, <<<
It's risky, but don't worry.  I've hired an outrageously expensive consultant who has never done this before.
>>> Ratbert says to Wally, <<<
I earned five hundred dollars just coming to this meeting.  How's YOUR day going?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
It won't make my top ten.
>>> 
1996-12-16 * 
Dilbert and an Elbonian man sit at a conference table.  The Elbonian says, <<<
Our Elbonian database product can replace every one of your current systems.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
No thanks.
>>> The Elbonian tells Alice, <<<
It can do payroll, accounts receivable, inventory, sales . . .
>>>  Alice says, <<<
No thanks.
>>> The Elbonian tells the Boss, <<<
And I'll throw in some golf balls.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
It's a deal!  Just toss them in the lake with all my other ones.
>>> 
1996-12-15 * 
The Boss tells Dilbert, <<<
I made an upgrade to your product design.
>>>  He hands Dilbert a document. Dilbert says, <<<
This would make the product overheat.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Let's try to look at the big picture.
>>> Dilbert reads the document and says, <<<
Okay . . . Let's see . . . Your upgrade has no benefits and it costs more.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
The overheating would start office fires and put all of our customers out of business.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
If our sales are strong, we could create economic chaos and a global firestorm.
>>> Dilbert concludes, <<<
Your 'upgrade' would destroy civilization as we know it.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Keep me informed.
>>> Back at home, Dilbert sits on the couch and Dogbert sits on the backrest.  Dogbert asks, <<<
So you're going to end civilization as we know it?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I don't think I'll miss it, frankly.
>>> 
1996-12-14 * 
The Boss tells Wally, <<<
After I graduate from 'Quality School' I'll be a quality black-belt master.
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Is the title metaphoric, or is there a chance you'll be beaten senseless during a breakout session?
>>>  The Boss slices the air with his hands as if he were practicing karate and thinks, <<<
Zip zip zip zip.
>>> The Boss hits Wally and knocks him to the floor.  Wally asks, <<<
Was that necessary?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
I'm not sure.  I haven't done the pre-course reading yet.
>>> 
1996-12-13 * 
The Boss, Wally and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
We must change our culture of cynicism and negativism.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
You two will be the 'Happiness Committee.'  Come up with some ideas to improve morale.
>>> Dilbert and Wally sit at a desk together.  Dilbert says, <<<
So far we've got: 1) Raises, 2) Slap-The-Boss Day and 3) Nude Fridays.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I feel my cynicism melting away already.
>>> 
1996-12-12 * 
A woman at a desk tells Dilbert, <<<
I'm flattered.  But I can't date you because we're different religions.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm flexible.  I'd change my religion to get a date.
>>>  The woman replies, <<<
It wouldn't work in this case.
>>> Dilbert sits on the couch and asks Dogbert, <<<

Nice try.

1996-12-05 * 
The Grim Reaper approaches Ratbert and says, <<<
Pssst!

Do you mind if I sit in on your stress-reduction class?

I'll burn in hell before I'll do your work plus my own, you filthy weasel!!!

This metric shows an excellent trend in the number of days since the beginning of my project.

That growth rate compares favorably with the best companies in our time zone.

I'm working smarter, not harder.

It's a whole new paradigm.

My tail is twitching . . .

That can only mean it's time to write some more evil policies.

I found many areas for improvement in your document, Alice.

You could put this on top of an ambulance as a warning.

I was thinking the same thing about you.
>>> 
1996-11-29 * 
Alice stands in front of the Boss's desk looking tired and disheveled.  She hands some documents to the Boss and says, <<<
Here's my presentation package.  I worked twelve straight hours on it.
>>> Alice continues, <<<
That includes three hours of creativity followed by nine hours of stupor, senseless twiddling and outright dementia.
>>> Alice says, <<<
I suppose there's only one thing that could make this presentation worse.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Send it around for comments.
>>> 
1996-11-28 * 
Dogbert sits on a stool and Dilbert sits in a chair.  Dogbert says, <<<
This lesson in interpersonal skills involves listening to a stupid person without rolling your eyes.
>>> A man says, <<<
My computer screen says, 'Press any key to continue.'  Can I borrow your keys?  Mine are locked in my Yugo.
>>> Dilbert covers his eyes and thinks, <<<
Must focus . . . Must . . . Focus . . .
>>>  The man says, <<<
I could break the driver's side window . . . But it's bad enough that the windshield is gone.

Hey, how about that low-pressure system, huh?!!

Again, but this time say 'weather.'
>>> 
1996-11-26 * 
The Boss sits at his desk and tells Dilbert, <<<
Whenever we disagree, I always end up yelling.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
That's an indication that you have poor interpersonal skills.  I'm sending you to a class to improve them.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It looks like you've gained weight.  Would it help if I started jogging?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
>>> 
1996-11-25 * 
Wally asks Catbert, <<<
When will my raise be effective?

Fool!  Give me your department!

Let go of my hair!!

Ouch!!

This is going better than usual.

>>> The Boss asks Dilbert, <<<
Why am I paying for a color printer?

It's also an air freshener if you know how to use it.
>>> 
1996-11-22 * 
Alice asks Wally, <<<
How do you like your new smoking habit?
>>> Wally replies, <<<
My teeth turned yellow, my breath is putrid, I'm a social outcast, I'm going broke, and my house burned down.

So you're going to quit?

No, I'm trying to take a long term view of it.
>>> 
1996-11-21 *

Are you getting that weird 'smokers' cognitive dissonance' yet?
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Man, this mountain biking is overrated.
>>> 
1996-11-20 * 
Wally approaches a man and a woman who are smoking.  He says, <<<
Here's my first cigarette ever.  I'm looking forward to the many smoking breaks I'm entitled to.

I quit.
>>> 
1996-11-19 *

Not that I need any help.

>>> 
1996-11-18 *

Try it, you big wuss.

Try identifying the problem and then solving it.
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
The leader waits while the brilliance of his contribution sinks in.

That's a much better idea than what I was doing.

Hello-o-o!!!  It's lunch time and I don't see sandwiches.

Dilbert sits at a table with a woman.  Dilbert asks, <<<
If you were hired, what would be your long-range career goals?

I'd have your job in six months.  In a year you'd be working for me, you big pile of dinosaur dung.
>>> Dilbert looks at the woman's resume and says, <<<
I see you attended an all women's college.  Does that make you more confident and assertive?

Either arm.  Let's go.

So . . . You're looking for a brilliant engineer who is actively seeking a pay cut?

Well, you have to consider the many intangibles.

Such as my savings account if I worked here?
>>> 
1996-11-13 * 
Dilbert sits at a table with a man.  Dilbert says, <<<
We like to ask our applicants some questions that will allow us to see how you think.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
If you have a five-gallon bucket and a fifty-gallon bucket, how can you tell which one holds more water?
>>> The man beats his head with his fists and says, <<<
Ow!  Ow!  Ow!

When I said, 'See how you think,' what I meant was . . .

There are two ways to get an extra engineer for your project.

YIPE!

You'd think that a woman named Madame Cruella would compensate by being extra nice.
>>> 
1996-11-08 * 
Dilbert sits on the couch using a laptop and Dogbert stands on the armrest.  Dogbert says, <<<
Men who understand technology are the new sex symbols.  Your online personals ad should emphasize your technical prowess.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How about 'Looking for woman who likes moonlit walks so I'll have more time alone with my computer'?
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
And 'Must like to dance.'  That's so I won't get a flabby, uncoordinated applicant.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Don't call them 'applicants' on the first date.

That's exactly why I need a spare.

The Boss, Dogbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I hired the Dogbert Consulting Company to add credibility to my decisions.

Doubled.  It should be doubled.

Hey, what's that tingle I feel all over my body?!!

Dilbert stands in line at a cash register.  He thinks, <<<
Mmm . . . Soon you will be mine, little chocolate bar.

I think I have exact change.

I can smell it through the wrapper.
>>>  The woman reaches into her purse and says, <<<
Here's a nickel.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I rub it on my arm to get the total body experience.
>>>  The woman looks into her pocketbook and says, <<<
No, that's a breath mint.

I am transported to another dimension.

Ooh, a roll of pennies . . . No, lipstick.
>>> Dilbert looks at the woman as she says, <<<
I'll give you a check.  Where's that checkbook?

You made your own screen saver?

Which side faces the wall?
>>> 
1996-10-30 *

Hey, Wally, is there anything you still like about working here?

I love my job.

Very impressive.  They must have taught you a lot about motivating employees.
>>>  Keith replies, <<<
No, not really.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Well . . . You probably learned how to identify and hire good people, right?
>>>  Keith replies, <<<
That might have been optional reading.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
Did you learn negotiation skills?  Strategic thinking?  Business writing?
>>>  Keith answers "No" to all three questions. Keith explains, <<<
It was mostly finance and accounting.  And economics.
>>> Alice says, <<<
So, you're a highly qualified leader because . . . You're good at math?

What should I do here?

In these situations I like to use swearing.

People with embarrassing e-mail systems . . .

I tell people, 'The reply function doesn't work.  You have to type in my address.'"  The man thinks, <<<
Loser.

1996-10-21 * 
Dilbert types, <<<
On the surface, you seem to make some good points about technology . . .

I prefer to think of myself as a technology 'have.'

>>> Wally continues, <<<
Thanks to my leadership, it is already an object of widespread mockery and derision.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
As I speak, our lawyers are purging every last trace of value it might have had.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
With luck, the project will be a gigantic failure in a month.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
People will forget my failure and remember that I'm experienced.  Promotions will follow.  Yes!!
>>> Wally concludes, <<<
In six months I'll be dating an executive secretary named Yvonne.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Good plan.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Wally, have you ever read our mission statement?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
Yeah, but I don't subscribe to a literal interpretation.
>>>

The caption says, <<<
At the trade show.
>>>  A man asks Alice, <<<
What can you tell me about your products?
>>> Alice replies, <<<
Our products are defective, much like yourself.
>>> Alice tells Asok, <<<
I probably shouldn't have stayed up all night setting up the booth.
>>>  The man asks, <<<
What are you doing later?
>>> 
1996-10-18 * 
The caption says, <<<
At the trade show.
>>>  Wally asks a man at a booth, <<<
What kind of free stuff do you have?
>>> Wally opens a shopping bag and says, <<<
Cheap pens?  That's original.  Okay, fill 'er up.  But I'm afraid I can't give you any eye contact.
>>> Wally walks away holding a bag of free stuff and thinking, <<<
That's enough industry research for today.  It's time to hit the buffet.
>>> 
1996-10-17 * 
Dilbert, Alice, Wally and the Boss sit at a conference table.  Alice says, <<<
Our consultant suggested putting attractive women in our booth at the trade show.
>>> Alice continues, <<<
I rejected that idea.  It is sexist and demeaning.  I have a better idea to increase traffic to our booth.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What's the dental floss for?
>>>  Alice replies, <<<
It's your thong bikini.  You'll stand in front of our competitor's booth.
>>> 
1996-10-16 * 
Dogbert stands on a conference table next to a laptop and an overhead projector.  Dogbert tells Alice, <<<
Your booth at the trade show must be attention-grabbing.  You have several options.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
1. Magic tricks  2. special effects  3. raffles  4. booth babes.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
For the best result, combine all four: create the illusion that you're raffling off the booth babes.
>>>  Alice asks, <<<
Booth babes?
>>> 
1996-10-15 * 
Dogbert and Alice sit at a conference table.  Dogbert says, <<<
If you plan to have a booth at the trade show, you need the 'Dogbert Trade-Show Consulting Company' to design it.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I recommend the deluxe booth.  It's guaranteed to generate the most revenue.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
How would the deluxe booth generate more revenue for my company?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Oh, suddenly this is about YOUR company?
>>> 
1996-10-14 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Alice, I'm putting you in charge of developing our booth for the big trade show.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I picked you because the males in the department have disqualified themselves through a process of strategic incompetence.
>>> Alice asks Dilbert, <<<
What is strategic incompetence?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I had that written down someplace, but I lost it.
>>> 
1996-10-13 * 
The Boss sits at his desk and says, <<<
Alice, your performance this year is 'meets expectations.'  You get a two percent raise.
>>> Alice looks shocked and says, <<<
MEETS EXPECTATIONS?!  I worked eighty hours every week!
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Yeah . . . Well, I expected that.
>>> Alice yells, <<<
I earned three patents this year!  The company will make millions!!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Really?  Wow.  I mean . . . I expected that too.
>>> Alice clenches her teeth and shouts, <<<
I donated bone marrow to our biggest customer!!!  Twice!!!
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
I noted that under 'attendance problem.'
>>> Alice, Dilbert and Wally sit at a table eating lunch.  Alice leans on the table and covers her face.  Dilbert tells her, <<<
I told you the bone marrow thing would haunt you.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I'm starting to think the time I worked through lunch was for nothing.
>>> 
1996-10-12 * 
Catbert sits at his desk thinking, <<<
When I'm in a bad mood, I like to think of ways to humiliate the employees.
>>> Catbert thinks, <<<
Hmm . . . How about an employee recognition program with a thoroughly worthless award.
>>>  Catbert purrs. The Boss hands Dilbert a plaque and says, <<<
It's pocket lint from a vice president's trousers.  He was wearing them on the day he left for a better job.
>>> 
1996-10-11 * 
Dilbert stands in front of an overhead projector and points at a skull and crossbones diagram.  Dilbert says, <<<
The status of our strategic alliance is 'doomed.'
>>> Dilbert continues while the Boss listens, <<<
Our ponderous and inefficient management style caused their best people to quit and create a competing company.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We must find a way to destroy that new company.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I'll see if they're interested in a strategic alliance.
>>> 
1996-10-10 * 
Dilbert stands in front of an overhead projector discussing <<<
Strategic Alliance Issues.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Issue one: Our two companies have very different corporate cultures.
>>> A man with a goatee sits at the conference table working on a laptop.  A woman with spiked hair sits next to him.  The man says, <<<
While you were droning I slammed out some beta code and put it on the Internet for comments.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
My company prefers to have that kind of decision made by uninformed executives.  We call it 'empowerment.'"  The man replies, <<<
I'll mention that in the press release.
>>> 
1996-10-09 * 
A man with a goatee and a woman with spiked hair who's wearing a tube top enter a room with Dilbert.  The man says, <<<
Our strategic alliance is working well.  My company provides amazing technical skill and your company . . .
>>> The man continues, <<<
. . . Has a seemingly endless supply of three-ring binders.
>>> They sit at a conference table.  Dilbert says, <<<
Resistance is futile.  You will be assimilated.
>>>  The woman asks, <<<
Is it true that if your name is written in a binder you lose your soul?
>>> 
1996-10-08 * 
Dilbert and a man with a goatee sit at a conference table.  Dilbert holds a thick binder and says, <<<
These are the procedures my company uses to approve projects.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I guess a small company such as yours is used to flying by the seat of the pants.
>>>  The man replies, <<<
Not necessarily.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
You mean you're flexible?
>>>  The man shows Dilbert his bare foot and leg and replies, <<<
I mean I'm not wearing pants.
>>> 
1996-10-07 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
You'll head our technology alliance with a small Silicon Valley start-up.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Their corporate culture is a bit different from ours. Try to be flexible.
>>> Dilbert and a man with a goatee and a ring through his head sit at a conference table.  Dilbert opens his briefcase and says, <<<
I've never seen a pierced brain before.
>>>  The man puts his bare feet on the table and says, <<<
I think I'll call you 'Mister Conservative.'
>>> 
1996-10-06 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, Wally and Alice, <<<
Nobody has nominated a co-worker for a special achievement award.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Someone in this group must have done SOMETHING good this year.
>>> Wally says, <<<
No . . . I don't think so.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
We'd remember something like that.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
This looks bad.  All the other departments are giving themselves awards.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We might have to lower our standards a bit.
>>>  Alice says, <<<
I've been proactive in that area.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Why are we standing in the hallway?
>>> Wally replies, <<<
We think the room is locked.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
We don't have the key.
>>> The caption says, <<<
Later that month.
>>>  The Boss hands Alice an award and says, <<<
This award goes to Alice for boldly trying the door knob.
>>>  Alice says, <<<
When I find out who nominated me . . .
>>> 
1996-10-05 * 
Ratbert walks across Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
You know what's funny?  I'll tell you.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
You're working hard.  I'm doing nothing.  In a hundred years we'll both be dead.
>>> Dilbert says angrily, <<<
You might not need to wait that long.
>>>  Ratbert says as he walks away, <<<
I think I'll spread some joy over this way.
>>> 
1996-10-04 * 
The Boss and a man sit at a conference table.  The man says, <<<
Your product looks good, but you can't be our supplier unless your company is ISO 9000 certified.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
So . . . You don't care how bad our internal processes are, as long as they're well-documented and used consistently?
>>> The man replies, <<<
That's right.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Our documented process says I must now laugh in your face and double our price.
>>> 
1996-10-03 * 
Dilbert sits at a table using a laptop.  Dilbert tells the man across the table, <<<
I need to document your job processes to satisfy our ISO 9000 requirements.
>>>  The man replies, <<<
Okay.
>>> The man says, <<<
I try to anticipate the shifting political winds.  Then I wrap myself in the relevant buzzwords and try to achieve importance without adding value.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What's your job title?
>>>  The man replies, <<<
Director of ISO 9000 Quality Process Design.
>>> 
1996-10-02 * 

1996-10-01 * 
The Boss, Wally and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
We'll be having an ISO 9000 audit soon.  They'll check to see if we follow our own documented procedures for everything we do.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I've divided our preparation tasks into two groups: unethical and unproductive.
>>> Wally tells Dilbert, <<<
I'll train our department to lie to the auditor.  You can document our inane procedures.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
No fair.  You did unethical last time too!
>>> 
1996-09-30 * 
Alice says to Catbert, <<<
I need to hire a programmer for my project team.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Our policy is to first seek candidates from within the company.  If none is qualified, you must use a sock puppet.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
How many of your policies are designed for the sole purpose of satisfying your sadistic tendencies?
>>>  Catbert replies, <<<
All of them.  Some are just more obvious.
>>> 
1996-09-29 * 
Dilbert approaches the cave where the accounting department is located.  He groans. Dilbert tells a troll, <<<
I saved $500 in airfare by extending my business trip to Saturday.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why won't you reimburse me for the Saturday hotel costs?
>>> The troll replies, <<<
Saturday was not a business-related activity.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Hmm . . . Let me see if I understand this . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
It's NOT business-related to make sensible economic choices . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But it IS business-related to waste money like an ugly, brain-dead troll . . .
>>> Dilbert arrives at home with his arm in a sling and wearing disheveled clothes.  He tells Dogbert, <<<
Then he beat me up and took my lunch money.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Are you saying I can get free lunch money by beating you up?
>>> 
1996-09-28 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair wearing a bathrobe and Dogbert sits on the armrest.  Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
. . . There I was, naked and exhausted, miles from shore.  Dolphins taunted me for hours.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Suddenly a deep sea sport fishing boat happened by.  I grabbed the line and held on for my life.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Wow!  That's lucky.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's what I thought . . . Until the second time they threw me back in.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I meant lucky for them.
>>> 
1996-09-27 * 
Dilbert treads water.  A dolphin says to him, <<<
Some dolphins in my situation would help you get to shore safely.
>>> The dolphin says, <<<
Others might try to distract you while an accomplice played a cruel joke.
>>>  Another dolphin swims up behind Dilbert. Dilbert yells, <<<
Come back here with my trunks!!!
>>>  One dolphin holds Dilbert's swimsuit in his mouth.  The other dolphin says, <<<
Let's asks the humming fish to do the 'Jaws' theme song.
>>> 
1996-09-26 * 
Dilbert thinks as he swims through the water, <<<
Uh-oh . . . I'm a mile from shore and too exhausted to swim back.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
My only hope is that an intelligent dolphin will see my plight and rescue me.
>>> Dilbert sees a dolphin and thinks, <<<
I'm in luck!
>>>  The dolphin says, <<<
Two words: tuna . . . net.
>>> 
1996-09-25 * 
Wally, Dilbert and Alice stand on the beach wearing swimsuits.  The Boss tells them, <<<
The first leg of the 'Iron Man' team-building exercise is a ten-mile swim, I think.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I won't be participating because my teamwork skills are already excellent.
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
Two phrases you don't expect to hear in the same day are 'Iron Man' and 'doggie paddle.'"  Someone in the water says, <<<
Hey!  No splashing!
>>> 
1996-09-24 * 
Dilbert arrives at home carrying his briefcase.  Dogbert sits on the couch armrest.  Dilbert says, <<<
My boss is making the engineers compete in an 'Iron Man' event.  It's supposed to improve teamwork.
>>> Dilbert sits on the couch and says, <<<
I'm glad I take the stairs sometimes instead of using the elevator.  I'm in pretty good shape.
>>>  Dilbert flexes his arm and feels his bicep. Dogbert says, <<<
Yes, you are, to the extent potato is a pretty good shape.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I just wrenched a muscle.
>>> 
1996-09-23 * 
The Boss sits at his desk thinking, <<<
I don't know how to fix any of the problems in this company.  Maybe I'll just sit here quietly.
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
No, that wouldn't look managerly . . . I'll have to do something idiotic and hope it looks like leadership.
>>> The Boss says to Dilbert, who is sitting at his desk, <<<
We're going to have an 'Iron Man' team-building competition.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
What a bunch of leadership . . .
>>> 
1996-09-22 * 
A man sits in his cubicle thinking, <<<
It's time to use my speakerphone to do voice mail.
>>> The man thinks, <<<
I can't remember if I use the speakerphone because I'm inconsiderate or because I'm too stupid to know how annoying it is.
>>> The man thinks, <<<
I'll leave that question to the philosophers.
>>> The man screams, <<<
Hi.  Thanks for the information.  Talk to you later!!!
>>> The man shouts, <<<
Did I tell you about my cyst?
>>>  Dilbert hears the man yelling and sends an e-mail message that says, <<<
Dogbert, send Bob the Dinosaur quickly!
>>> Bob says to the building security officer, <<<
I'm here to deliver a wedgie.
>>>  The man replies, <<<
Use the service elevator.
>>> Dilbert sits at his desk humming while the man next to him screams as Bob gives him a wedgie. Dilbert presses the elevator button and asks Bob, <<<
What's the best part - the look on their faces or the way they yell?
>>>  Bob replies, <<<
I'll leave that question to the philosophers.
>>> 
1996-09-21 * 
The Boss and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  Dilbert says, <<<
I've got an idea.  Let's add a battery backup to our product.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
One . . . Two . . . Three . . .
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I've got an idea.  Why don't we add a battery backup to our product?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Because our product doesn't use electricity.
>>> 
1996-09-20 * 
Tina the Tech Writer sits at her desk and writes, <<<
To insert a column, click the column insert menu.
>>> Tina types, <<<
But let's be honest, userboy, if you need to be told THAT, you're too stupid to use this product.
>>> Tina asks Dilbert, <<<
Have you reviewed the draft yet?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I'm up to the chapter titled 'Duh.'
>>> 
1996-09-19 * 
Dogbert stands on the Boss's desk and says, <<<
Here's my invoice for fixing your 'Year 2000' computer problems.
>>> The Boss screams so loud that Dogbert is thrown from the office. Back at home, Dilbert sits on the couch and Dogbert sits on the armrest.  Dilbert says, <<<
. . . So his head spun, but it DIDN'T explode?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Yeah.  I guess I left some money on the table.
>>> 
1996-09-18 * 
Dogbert and Ratbert stand on a desk chair in front of a computer.  Dogbert says, <<<
Ratbert, your job is to review eighty million lines of computer code in the company's systems.
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
You're looking for any reference to the current year.  Those pieces of code will be a problem when the year is 2000.
>>> Six months later, Ratbert and Dogbert sit at a conference table.  Ratbert says, <<<
I'm happy to report that the date did not show up once.  In fact, it was all just zeros and ones!
>>>  Dogbert thinks, <<<
Oops.
>>> 
1996-09-17 * 
The Boss and Dogbert sit at a conference table.  Dogbert says, <<<
When the year 2000 comes, your computers will think it's the year '00' and cause major problems.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
The Dogbert Consulting Company can fix the problem for only ten million dollars.  Our work is guaranteed for one full year, starting today.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
But why would I care?  The year '00' is before I'm born.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Amazing . . . You'd actually have to be SMARTER to do something STUPID.
>>> 
1996-09-16 * 
Dilbert lies on a couch in a therapist's office.  Dilbert says, <<<
On weekends I'll feel my pager vibrate . . . But when I go to check it, I realize I'm not wearing it.
>>> The psychologist replies, <<<
It's a classic case of phantom-pager syndrome.  It's common among technology workers.
>>> The psychiatrist adds, <<<
There's no treatment for it.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I don't want to treat it.  I want to relocate it.
>>> 
1996-09-15 * 
The Boss, Catbert, Wally, Dilbert and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Mr. Catbert, our evil director of human resources, will describe our new cubicle plan.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Last year we reduced the size of cubicles in the densification project.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
We didn't save much money, but we did lower morale.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
This year we'll build on that success . . .
>>> Catbert holds a square box and says, <<<
With the patented 'Head Cubicle.'
>>> Catbert lifts the Head Cubicle and says, <<<
Hold still, Wally.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
And the head cubicle can be recycled after you're downsized!
>>>  The cubicle covers Wally's head. Dilbert, Alice and Wally wear the cubicles on their heads.  Alice says, <<<
We really need to draw the line at some point.
>>>  Dilbert adds, <<<
While we still have our dignity.
>>> 
1996-09-14 * 
The Boss tells Dilbert and Wally, <<<
In today's news, our company has decided to buy another dying company in a business we don't fully understand.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Our stock rose five points on the announcement.
>>> Wally asks Dilbert, <<<
Why does our stock go up every time we do something boneheaded?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I like to think of it as our competitive advantage.
>>> 
1996-09-13 * 
The Boss reads a document and tells Dilbert, Wally and Alice, <<<
The company announced that we will 'abandon our strategy of making good products . . .'
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
From now on we'll 'pursue a desperate strategy of mergers, business spin-offs, fruitless partnerships and random reorganizations.'
>>> The Boss reads, <<<
And we'll accelerate our program of paying the good employees to leave.
>>>  Dilbert asks Wally, <<<
Stock price?
>>>  Wally looks at his monitor and replies, <<<
Up three points.
>>> 
1996-09-12 * 
Alice, Dilbert, Wally and the Boss sit around a table.  The Boss is sleeping.  Alice yells, <<<
It's hopeless!  You're losers!  We'll never make a sundial out of a pencil and an eaten donut!
>>> The janitor enters the room and says, <<<
Hee hee!  All you had to do was stick the pencil in the donut.
>>> The janitor lies over the table with the pencil sticking out of his back.  Dilbert says, <<<
We just broke all kinds of union rules.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
But hey!  Look at the shadow from the pencil!
>>> 
1996-09-11 * 
Dogbert says to Alice, Dilbert, the Boss and Wally, <<<
This next exercise will challenge your ability to solve problems as a team.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Build a working sundial using only a pencil and a donut.
>>> Four hours later, the Boss says with his mouth full, <<<
One more bite isn't going to make any difference.
>>>  The pencil lies next to a pile of crumbs on the table.  Dilbert covers his eyes and sobs. 
1996-09-10 * 
Dogbert says to Dilbert, the Boss and Wally, <<<
This exercise will build trust.  The partner in front will fall.  The partner behind will break the fall.
>>> The Boss falls backward toward Dilbert. The Boss falls to the floor.  Dogbert says, <<<
Okay, maybe trust isn't your biggest problem here.
>>> 
1996-09-09 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally, Alice and Dogbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I've hired the 'Dogbert Touchy-Feely Institute' to teach use about teamwork.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
We'll start with an exercise about trust.  I want each of you to sign blank checks and give them to me.
>>> As they all hand Dogbert checks, Dilbert asks, <<<
What will this teach us about trust?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
It will teach you that trust is an excellent quality for other people to have.
>>> 
1996-09-08 * 
The Boss says to Tina the Tech Writer, <<<
Tina, we need a few minor edits on our product brochure.
>>>  Tina sits at her desk and thinks, <<<
Minor?  Uh-oh . . .
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
We've discovered that our product causes hallucinations and sterility.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
See if you can put a positive spin on that.
>>> Tina thinks, <<<
This will be my greatest writing challenge yet.
>>> Tina types, <<<
Are you tired of the same old sights?  We've got you covered.
>>> Tina types, <<<
. . . Makes a great gift for those people who - in your opinion - should not reproduce.
>>> Tina thinks, <<<
Ooh . . . I feel a tiny pang of conscience.  That's one.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
So the brochure was only a three-panger?
>>>  Tina replies, <<<
Yeah, and I think I faked the third one.
>>> 
1996-09-07 * 
Dogbert sits on a desk.  The Boss asks, <<<
Can you program the routers to block employees from all fun Web sites?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Why stop there?  I can program the routers to block ALL useless activities.
>>>  The Boss asks, <<<
How long will that take?
>>> Dogbert unplugs a cable and says, <<<
Done.  I've seen your business plan.
>>> 
1996-09-06 * 
Dogbert stands on a chair with his paw poised over the keyboard.  Dogbert thinks, <<<
As network administrator I can take down the network with one keystroke.
>>> Dogbert presses a key and the employees all scream. Dogbert thinks, <<<
It's just like being a doctor but without getting gooky stuff on my paws.
>>> 
1996-09-05 * 
Asok says to Dogbert, <<<
I have forgotten my password.  I humbly beg for assistance.
>>> Dogbert replies angrily, <<<
I have no time for boring administrative tasks, you fool!  I'm busy upgrading the network!
>>> Asok says, <<<
You could have give me a new password in the time it took to belittle me.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Yes, but which option would give me job satisfaction?
>>> 
1996-09-04 * 
Dogbert stands on a desk chair and thinks, <<<
I have total access to every employee's e-mail messages.
>>> Dogbert thinks, <<<
With a few strategic edits I will transform the office into 'Melrose Place.'
>>> Wally says to Alice, <<<
Yes, Alice . . . I WILL be your 'monkey of love.'
>>> 
1996-09-03 * 
Dogbert stands on the chair armrest and tells Dilbert, <<<
I got hired as the network administrator for your company.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Here's my card.  You can only reach me by e-mail or by pager.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
When the network breaks, no e-mail.  I'll just sit around and wag my tail.
>>>  Dilbert looks at the business card and says, <<<
Your pager number has a tilde . . . How do I dial a tilde?
>>> 
1996-09-02 * 
Dogbert sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss asks, <<<
Why do you want a job as our network administrator, Mister Dogbert?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I don't like people.  This is a good opportunity to annoy idiots such as yourself for my own entertainment.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Wow.  You're perfect.  Can you start tomorrow?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Sure, as far as you know.  I'll give you my pager number.
>>> 
1996-09-01 * 
A man says, <<<
In this two day workshop, you will learn to embrace our company's mission and vision.
>>>  Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit in the audience. The man continues, <<<
At first glance it will appear to be a bunch of useless jargon created by functionally illiterate executives.
>>> The man continues, <<<
But after we do some mind-numbing group exercises . . .
>>> The man continues, <<<
. . . You'll forget that you're underpaid and you have no job security.
>>> The man turns to an easel and says, <<<
We'll begin by writing down all the things that 'ethical behavior' means to you.
>>> Alice says, <<<
I've got a better idea: if you let us leave now, we'll give you high marks on the class evaluation.
>>> The man stands at the front of the room thinking. Wally hands the man his evaluation and says, <<<
Good job.  You touched me.
>>>  The man replies, <<<
You wish.
>>> 
1996-08-31 * 
Dogbert and Ratbert walk through the house.  Dogbert says, <<<
I hear you're becoming an annoying person who misinterprets everything.
>>>  Ratbert replies, <<<
Yes, I'm more assertive.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I said annoying, not assertive.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
Apology accepted.
>>>  They stand at the top of the cellar stairs. Dogbert opens the dryer door and says, <<<
Whatever you do, don't climb in this clothes dryer.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
Yeah, it does look cozy in there.
>>> 
1996-08-30 * 
Ratbert sits on top of Dilbert's monitor and says, <<<
I've become one of those people who misinterprets everything you say.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Why?
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
Why?  Are you saying that nothing should ever change?  Maybe you shouldn't be so rigid.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
This could be very annoying.
>>>  Ratbert replies, <<<
Maybe you should see a therapist for your emotional problem.
>>> 
1996-08-29 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert walk outdoors.  Dilbert says, <<<
. . . So the salesperson made an idiotic promise to our customer.  Now it's MY job to fix it.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
The brain is an amazing thing.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Are you saying that if I use the untapped power of my brain, there's a solution?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
No, I'm saying my amazing brain filtered out your boring story so I could enjoy my walk.
>>> 
1996-08-28 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk and tells the Boss, <<<
At first I thought you committed me to an impossible deadline.  But I have a theoretical solution.
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
It involves flying around the earth so fast that I travel back to the past.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
And then you'll have enough time?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
No, then I'll give your parents this pamphlet on contraception.
>>> 
1996-08-27 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Good news, Alice.  I'm going to have quarterly performance reviews to boost morale.
>>> Alice stands in her cubicle and replies, <<<
Wow!  In addition to working sixteen hours a day in this big box, now I'll get 300&#037; more criticism!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'll have a chance to hear employee concerns four times a year.
>>>  Alice says, <<<
I assume comprehension will remain on the bicentennial plan.
>>> 
1996-08-26 * 
Catbert stands on the Boss's desk and says, <<<
Morale is low because the employees are underpaid.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
You can compensate by having more frequent performance reviews.  They love feedback.
>>> Catbert clenches his teeth and thinks, <<<
The hardest part is keeping a straight face.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Tell me again why I'd want morale to be high?
>>> 
1996-08-25 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Our senior vice president will be dropping in today.
>>> The Boss holds up a chart showing "lies" and <<<
boss level.
>>>  He says, <<<
Remember to increase your lies accordingly.
>>> The Boss holds up a chart showing "details" and <<<
boss level.
>>>  He says, <<<
And decrease the details you provide.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
If I think you're being too informative, I'll signal by fidgeting.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Just say everything is fine, but we need more funding.  Here he comes.
>>> The senior VP stands in the doorway and says, <<<
Sorry I'm late.  How is everyone?
>>> Wally replies, <<<
I'm not saying.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I'm fine, but I need more funding.
>>>  Alice replies, <<<
I have a wide variety of super powers.
>>> The senior VP thinks, <<<
I feel a sudden, urgent need to unload my stock options.
>>>  The Boss waves his arms and thinks, <<<
Fidget fidget.
>>> 
1996-08-24 * 
Dilbert lies on the couch reading a magazine and Dogbert sits on the armrest.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm going to use bad grammar more often.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
My leadership will change the language through the principle of common usage.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
And I won't stop until the entire language is reduced to grunting and pointing!  Buwaha ha ha!!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I really got ripped off by that dog obedience school.
>>> 
1996-08-23 * 
The caption says, <<<
Asok the Intern.
>>>  Dilbert, Alice, Asok and Wally sit at a conference table.  Asok says, <<<
I came in over the weekend and looked at the design you've been working with all year.
>>> Asok continues, <<<
It turns out that you could have built the unit at half the cost with just one minor change.
>>> Asok continues, <<<
Is it true I can win awards for this sort of thing?
>>>  Alice whispers to Wally, <<<
Fetch the internapult.
>>> 
1996-08-22 * 
Asok stands behind Wally's desk and says, <<<
I am only a lowly intern, but I see an obvious solution to your problem.
>>> Asok says, <<<
Just click here . . . Clear your buffers and initialize the link . . . Now use this code patch for the memory leak.
>>> Asok says, <<<
This is funny if you consider that your salary is twice as much as mine.
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
I'm laughing on the inside.
>>> 
1996-08-21 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk and tells Dogbert, <<<
I invented a new data encryption program called P.H.B. which stands for Pointy-Haired Boss.
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
It converts e-mail into manager babble.  Nobody can intercept and decode my private messages without the key.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Who would want to read YOUR messages?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Somebody MIGHT want to read my messages.  It could happen!
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
And maybe you should carry pepper spray in case supermodels try to kiss you.
>>> 
1996-08-20 * 
Dilbert listens as Asok says to the Boss, <<<
My idea is that everyone should be required to use small fonts.  That way we'll save disk space.
>>> Asok continues, <<<
And I've noticed that many people use entire colons in situations where a semicolon would do just fine.
>>> As they walk away, Asok says to Dilbert, <<<
You're right, that was fun.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
The real fun is when he describes his new ideas at the next staff meeting.
>>> 
1996-08-19 * 
Alice and Wally sit at a table eating lunch.  Alice says, <<<
I've hit the glass ceiling.  I'll never be promoted again.
>>> Wally replies, <<<
That's because you're not willing to 'play the game.'  You have to look and act like the person who can promote you.
>>> In order to look like the Boss, Alice shapes her hair into two points, puts on a suit and stuffs a pillow under her shirt.  The Boss sees her and thinks, <<<
Ooo la la!
>>>  Alice thinks, <<<
This had better work.
>>> 
1996-08-18 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert walk down the sidewalk.  Dogbert says, <<<
People are getting stupider every day, relatively speaking.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
The complexity of the world is increasing geometrically.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
But your ability to learn is at the same slow trickle it has always been.
>>> Dogbert climbs onto a rock and continues, <<<
Information is gushing toward your brain like a firehose aimed at a teacup.
>>> Dogbert stands on the rock and continues, <<<
You're at a crossroads in history.  Even the smartest among you has become 'functionally stupid.'
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Your only hope is to choose a leader whose vision can penetrate the thick fog of human incompetence.
>>> Dogbert raises his paws and shouts, <<<
Dogbert for Supreme Ruler of Earth!!
>>> Dilbert sits on a rock and asks, <<<
Do you want my opinion?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
What are the odds of that?
>>> 
1996-08-17 * 
The Boss says to Wally, <<<
Good news, Wally.  Most of our smart employees quit to get much better jobs elsewhere.  Now we don't have to do any downsizing.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Your job is safe.  We need you to do the work of all the people who left.
>>> Wally, Dilbert and Alice sit at a table eating lunch.  Wally asks, <<<
Is it just me . . . or is the quality of 'good news' really going downhill lately?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I'd have to say you're both going downhill.
>>> 
1996-08-16 * 
Wally sits across from Dogbert's desk and Dogbert sits on the desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
The company won't lay you off if enough people quit first.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Your best strategy is to convince your co-workers that their jobs are intolerable.
>>> Wally shines a flashlight on Asok and points a video camera at him.  Wally says, <<<
We do this for all the young employees, Asok.  I'll capture the exact moment that your life force leaves your body.
>>> 
1996-08-15 * 
Wally sits across from Dogbert's desk and says, <<<
I was fired once, but I came back as a contract employee.  Later I was rehired at a higher salary.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Now I'm being downsized again.  Do you think they'll be dumb enough to hire me a third time?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Your story reminds me of the parable of the ant and the spider.
>>>  Wally asks, <<<
Really?  How?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
They're both boring.
>>> 
1996-08-14 * 
Ted says to Wally, <<<
I hear you're on the layoff list, Wally.  Has anyone claimed your chair yet?
>>> A man says, <<<
I claimed it a few minutes ago.
>>>  Ted yells, <<<
Liar!
>>> As the two men fight, Wally says, <<<
I guess it's true what they say about layoffs being hard on the survivors.
>>> 
1996-08-13 * 
The Boss and Wally sit at a table.  The Boss says, <<<
We don't do 'layoffs' at this company.  But you HAVE been selected to participate in our mobility pool!
>>> The Boss explains, <<<
As the name implies, you get to scurry around trying to find a nonexistent internal job before the ax falls.
>>> Wally asks, <<<
How's this different from a layoff?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
With layoffs you get to keep your dignity.
>>> 
1996-08-12 * 
Catbert peers over the wall and says, <<<
Hey, Wally . . . Big layoffs coming.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
I've seen the list.  I know more about your future than you do.  But it's a secret.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
Sadly, cats don't keep secrets very well.
>>>  Ted says to Wally, <<<
Nice chair.
>>> 
1996-08-11 * 
The Boss sits at his desk and says into the telephone, <<<
This voice mail message is for the whole department.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Every morning from now on you'll get my 'Quality Thought of the Day.'
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Today's thought is . . . Um . . .
>>> The Boss looks in a desk drawer and continues, <<<
Let's see . . . According to Webster's dictionary . . .
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Aardvark is a burrowing African mammal that eats ants.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
What if we were more like that?
>>>  Dilbert sits at his desk listening to the message. The Boss continues, <<<
I mean like the aardvark, not the ants . . .
>>>  Alice looks at her phone. The Boss stands by the printer thinking, <<<
That's weird.  Every time I leave my Quality Thought of the Day, the shared printer starts spewing resumes.
>>>  Dilbert and Wally peek around the corner. 
1996-08-10 * 
The Boss, Alice and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
You employees are the key to our economic success.
>>> The Boss explains, <<<
Anytime we need a little stock-price boost, we just fire another batch of you.  It's like printing money!
>>> The Boss holds up a chart and says, <<<
In fact, 'incompetence' has become our most profitable product.
>>>  Alice says, <<<
Wow.  It beat out 'lying to customers.'
>>> 
1996-08-09 * 
Dilbert looks over the wall into Wally's cubicle and says, <<<
Wally, these peer reviews are like the famous 'prisoner's dilemma.'
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
If you rat on me but I say good things about you, you get the biggest raise.  But if we praise each other we can BOTH get a small raise.
>>> Alice looks over the wall and says, <<<
Wally, if you rat him out, I'll let you look at my 'Victoria's Secret' catalog.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
This is exactly why there are no coed prisons.
>>> 
1996-08-08 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert and Wally, <<<
It's time to do peer performance reviews!
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Remember, there's a limited budget for raises.  Your best strategy is to slander your co-workers so there's more money for you!
>>> Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
I plan to say very nice things about YOU.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Nice try, weasel boy.
>>>  The Boss thinks as he walks away, <<<
Managing is easy when you hate the employees.
>>> 
1996-08-07 * 
Catbert says to Tina, <<<
It has come to my attention that you used company resources to send e-mail to your boyfriend.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
I'm willing to overlook this ugly incident in exchange for five minutes of quality petting on my soft, furry belly.
>>> Tina pets Catbert's stomach and says, <<<
This seems so wrong.
>>>  Catbert says, <<<
Try using both hands.
>>> 
1996-08-06 * 
Tina thinks, <<<
I accidentally sent my torrid love letter to every person on our e-mail system.
>>> Tina peers out of her cubicle and thinks, <<<
Should I hide forever or can I count on the professionalism of my co-workers?
>>> Wally points to Tina's cubicle and says, <<<
We'll complete our 'Career Day' tour with an exhibit that I call 'Tina, the Red-Faced Monkey of Love.'"  Three children look in the cubicle and one says, <<<
It's hiding.
>>> 
1996-08-05 * 
Tina types, <<<
Tom, you delicious hunk of burning love: if you were in my cubicle now I'd . . .
>>> Tina thinks, <<<
It looks as if I'm working.  Nobody can tell that I'm sending steamy e-mail to my new boyfriend.
>>> Dilbert says to Tina, <<<
Tina, two things:  watch out for the 'send to all' address, and thank you very much.
>>>  Dilbert's tie and his hair stand up straight. 
1996-08-04 * 
The Boss says to his secretary, <<<
Carol, from now on I'd like you to type up all of my incoming voice mail so I can just read it.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
And print out all of my e-mail every day so I don't have to log onto the network.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
And get me a sandwich from the cafeteria.  Ooh, no cash.  I'll pay you back.
>>> Carol asks, <<<
Do you want me to prechew the sandwich or can you handle that on your own?
>>> Carol says to Wally and Dilbert, <<<
Listen up, you overpaid engineers . . .
>>> Carol continues, <<<
By order of our reclusive boss, the new dress code for engineers is bumblebee costumes.
>>> Carol continues, <<<
If you don't believe me, send him voice mail and ask for yourself.  Oh, and he wants you to buy him a sandwich.
>>> The Boss asks Carol, <<<
Still no messages this week?  Is everybody out sick?
>>>  Carol replies, <<<
I heard they have hives.
>>>  Dilbert stands next to the Boss wearing a bee costume. 
1996-08-03 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
If we are to succeed, you must become change masters in an ever-changing, change-adaptive environment.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Let me get this straight . . . Every change seems to increase our workload while decreasing our job security and real earnings after inflation . . .
>>> Wally asks, <<<
And the problem is OUR lack of flexibility?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Not entirely.  There's also your bad morale.
>>> 
1996-08-02 * 
Dilbert sits on the couch and Dogbert stands on the armrest.  Dogbert says, <<<
My dominion over the planet is not widely recognized by the dolts who are breathing my air.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
So I've declared total sovereignty over a small, ever-widening zone surrounding my body.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How big is the zone?
>>>  Dogbert says into a megaphone, <<<
You have just entered Dogbertland.  Please show your passport and leave the oxygen alone!
>>> 
1996-08-01 * 
Dogbert stands behind Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
The votes are in.  I've been elected to the position of Supreme Ruler of Earth.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I won in a landslide, thanks to low voter turnout and the fact that I voted for myself many times.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I hope you'll be a benevolent ruler.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I think I'll make caning an Olympic event.
>>> 
1996-07-31 * 
A man hands a briefcase to Dogbert and says, <<<
I'm from the Association For Products That Are Bad For You.  Here's a generous contribution to your campaign.
>>> Dogbert opens the briefcase and says, <<<
This is so cool!  I'll use your money to get elected, then I'll put your entire industry in prison to cover my tracks!
>>> The man drives his car and thinks, <<<
This probably wrecks my chances of being named Briber of the Month.
>>> 
1996-07-30 * 
Dogbert stands on a stage and says to an audience, <<<
Vote for me and I will reform the tax code so that only idiots have to pay taxes!
>>> The crowd cheers and chants Dogbert's name. Dilbert sits on the couch and Dogbert sits on the armrest.  Dogbert says, <<<
I hope nobody asks me to define 'idiots.'"  Dilbert says, <<<
. . . So, under your plan I wouldn't pay ANY taxes, right?
>>> 
1996-07-29 * 
Dogbert appears on the <<<
Larry King Live" show.  Dogbert says into the microphone, <<<
Larry, I'm here to announce my candidacy for Supreme Ruler of the Universe.
>>> Larry says, <<<
That's funny!  Tell us about your next movie, Sharon.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I'm not Sharon Stone.  I said that to get on the show.
>>> Larry says, <<<
So . . . When I embraced you before the show . . .
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I think we're both glad I have no visible mouth.
>>> 
1996-07-28 * 
The caption says, <<<
The Budget Trap.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
I need a quick estimate for how much your next project will cost, Wally.
>>> Wally replies, <<<
How should I know?  You haven't even told me what my next project is.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
That's okay.  I only need a rough estimate for planning purposes.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I see where this is going.  You're going to turn my wild guess into a budget.  Later I'll be blamed when it's wrong.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
No, no.  I won't hold you to these numbers.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Well . . . Okay, let's say two million dollars.
>>> The Boss says as he walks away, <<<
Ooh . . . Can't afford that.  I'll put you down for twenty thousand dollars.
>>> The caption says, <<<
One year later . . .
>>>  The Boss sits at his desk and says to Wally, <<<
You're way over budget.  Can you show me the cause?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
It depends.  Can mirrors reflect your image?
>>> 
1996-07-27 * 
Dogbert sits behind Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
From now on, I will not try to reason with the idiots I encounter.  I will dismiss them by waving my paw and saying 'bah.'
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Just because someone thinks differently from you doesn't mean he's an idiot, Dogbert.
>>> Dogbert waves his paw and says, <<<
Bah.
>>> 
1996-07-26 * 
Dogbert stands on a desk chair and tells Dilbert, <<<
Here in the 'Dogbert Institute for Advanced Thinking,' I have devised a plan for ending poverty.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
My plan is to wait until there are so many talk shows on television that all the people with wretched lives can be paid guests.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What about the poor people who don't want to be on talk shows?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
We'll get the stragglers on 'Cops.'
>>> 
1996-07-25 * 
Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  Dilbert says, <<<
It looks like we'll release our new product on time, despite its many defects.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
We've minimized the economic impact of the defects via an advanced business process called 'hoping nobody notices.'
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
And we've doubled our projected income by modifying our assumptions!
>>>  Wally adds, <<<
A lot of this job is mental.
>>> 
1996-07-24 * 
Alice stands in front of the Boss's desk and says, <<<
I admit I was skeptical when you said I would be empowered to make my own decisions . . .
>>> Alice continues, <<<
But I give you credit.  You've let me work independently for three months . . . What's that look on your face?
>>> Alice says, <<<
Please tell me that it was empowerment I was experiencing.
>>>  The Boss asks, <<<
Did I ever mention that your project was canceled?
>>> 
1996-07-23 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk and Ratbert sits on the back of his chair.  Ratbert says, <<<
I may be an ignorant rat, but that's okay because ignorance is . . . Um . . . Um . . .
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
BLISS . . . Ignorance is BLISS.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
Oh, great.  Now it's gone.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Oops.
>>> 
1996-07-22 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk and says, <<<
Now that job security is a thing of the past, I've noticed that my company loyalty has vanished, too.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
And when you made my bonus primarily dependent on the blunders of senior management, my motivation fluttered away like a lonely sparrow.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
So your point is?
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
No point.  I just didn't have any reason to be working.
>>> 
1996-07-21 * 
Dilbert stands by the door putting his coat on.  He asks, <<<
Dogbert, do you think love is the strongest force in the universe?
>>> Dogbert replies as they walk down the front steps, <<<
No, I'd have to go with stupidity.
>>> They walk outdoors.  Dogbert continues, <<<
Followed closely by it's cousin ignorance.
>>> Dilbert lifts Dogbert onto a fence.  Dogbert continues, <<<
Morning breath is number three.  Thanks for reminding me.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Then you've got selfishness, lust, fear, money and luck.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
But love is in the top ten, right?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
It's fourteenth, right after foolish optimism.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Someone needs his little round back scratched.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Do not.
>>> Dilbert scratches Dogbert's back and asks, <<<
Where's love now?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
It'd down and to the left . . . LEFT!!  LEFT!!  LEFT!!  Oowahh . . .
>>> 
1996-07-20 * 
Alice sits at her desk.  The Boss says, <<<
It's time for me to update your objectives, Alice.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
We need targets that can only be achieved by amazingly hard work plus the constant support of management.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'm busy, so you'll have to write them yourself.
>>>  Alice asks, <<<
What's wrong with this picture?
>>> 
1996-07-19 * 
Dilbert sits on the couch and Dogbert sits on the backrest.  Dilbert shows Dogbert a ring and says, <<<
As you can see from my ring, I'm a member of the 'Talc Club' at work.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
With hard work and a bit of luck I will rise to the next level: shale.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I can honestly say my respect for you has never been higher.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Someday, God willing, I'll make it to aluminum.
>>> 
1996-07-18 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Our new 'recognition program' assigns the names of precious gems to your levels of performance.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
The highest level is diamond.  You get a new ring at each level.
>>>  The Boss hands out ring boxes. Wally asks, <<<
Are you sure talc is a precious gem?
>>>  Dilbert moves his hand and says, <<<
I think I saw it sparkle.
>>> 
1996-07-17 * 
Dilbert and Liz sit on a park bench.  Liz says, <<<
Um . . . When I've shared my feelings with you, I wasn't hoping you'd design an action plan to solve all of my problems.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why else would you tell me all of your problems . . . Unless it's some demented plot to make yourself feel better at my expense?
>>> Back at home, Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
You were right.  It was all a demented plot.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm trying to gradually lift your veil of ignorance.
>>> 
1996-07-16 * 
Dilbert and Liz hold hands.  Dilbert says, <<<
In the year that we've dated, Liz, you've often mentioned various problems in your life.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I've compiled those problems into a list of requirements and developed a comprehensive set of solutions.
>>> Liz reads the list and says angrily, <<<
How thoughtful.  I didn't even know I was broken.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
No, no, not broken . . . Just a bit buggy.
>>> 
1996-07-15 * 
Wally sits across from Catbert's desk.  Catbert says, <<<
According to my sources, you've been enjoying your job, Wally.
>>> Wally replies, <<<
It was temporary.  I don't know what got into me . . .
>>>  Catbert says, <<<
Please refer to page one of the employee manual.
>>> Wally reads the manual, <<<
Job satisfaction is the same as stealing from the company.
>>>  Catbert says, <<<
I'll have to charge you for admission unless I start hearing some shrieks of pain.
>>> 
1996-07-14 * 
Alice sits at her desk.  The Boss enters and says, <<<
According to this phone bill, you've been making personal calls.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
That's like stealing from the company, Alice.
>>> Alice clenches her teeth, holds her fist and thinks, <<<
Must . . . Control . . . Fist . . . Of . . . Death . . .
>>> Alice looks at the telephone bill and says, <<<
I only spent eighty cents to tell my family I was working late.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Here's a dollar.  The extra twenty cents is for the personal thought that I'm about to have on company time.
>>> Alice closes her eyes and imagines the Boss tied up with rope.  She pictures handing him a stick of dynamite. Alice says, <<<
And here's my bill for $40,000 in unpaid overtime that the company stole from me.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
That's not stealing; that's being competitive.
>>>  Alice says, <<<
I think I'll be competitive with a few bushels of office supplies later today.
>>> 
1996-07-13 * 
Catbert peers over the wall and says, <<<
Wally, it's time for your mandatory blood test.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I don't take drugs.
>>>  Catbert, who is holding a syringe, replies, <<<
I'm testing to see if you're stealing time from the company.
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Time?  How can you test for that?
>>>  Catbert replies, <<<
We test your general health.  If it's good, you're not working enough hours.  You thief.
>>> 
1996-07-12 * 
The Boss's secretary tells Dilbert, <<<
He's with the other managers in an employee ranking and rating session.
>>> The secretary continues, <<<
Your salary depends on how well your boss can defend your proposed raise to the other managers.
>>>  Dilbert covers his eyes and sobs. A man says to the Boss, <<<
I'm fairly sure this Dilbert guy works for you.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Doesn't ring a bell.
>>> 
1996-07-11 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, Alice and Wally, <<<
I'm assigning each of you to a separate 'quality' initiative.
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Is there any risk this will devour our productive hours, lower our morale and have no impact on our profitability?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
And we'll have a contest to come up with a name for the overall initiative.
>>>  Wally asks, <<<
How about 'Qualicide?'
>>> 
1996-07-10 * 
Dilbert says to the Boss, <<<
I need your full management support in this meeting with sales.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Just watch the master at work.
>>> A man says to the Boss, <<<
I promised a customer a product that we don't make.  You need to engineer-up a thousand units by early next week.
>>>  The Boss asks, <<<
Is Thursday okay?
>>> As they walk away, the Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
Wait until he finds out that Thursday isn't 'early next week.'  Hee hee!
>>> 
1996-07-09 * 
A man stands behind Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
Thanks for making that product mock-up last week.  The customer liked it so much that he ordered a thousand!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That was a MOCK-UP!  We don't even make that product yet.  It would take three years to make one.
>>> The man says, <<<
Just give me a thousand mock-ups.  The first one was terrific!
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
The mock-up was our competitor's product with duct tape over the logo.

Dilbert and Dogbert walk on the grass.  Dogbert says, <<<
Someday when I become the supreme ruler of earth . . .
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert sit on a park bench.  Dogbert continues, <<<
I'll order everybody to go outside once a day and run around with their mouths open.

Because you support fresh air and exercise?

Because I hate flies.

The Boss tells Dilbert, <<<
I'll be writing your performance review this afternoon.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
But this morning I'm helping my daughter sell cub girl cookies.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
For your shopping convenience I have assigned a name to each volume level.
>>> Dilbert reads, <<<
Zero to four boxes is the 'downsizer' volume . . .
>>> Dilbert reads, <<<
Five to eight boxes is the 'low performer' volume level.
>>> Dilbert writes on the order form and says, <<<
Let's say six hundred boxes.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Ahh . . . The 'fast tracker.'  An excellent choice.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What's your daughter's name?
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Ooh . . . Gotta go.

I only bought twelve boxes.  Now I'm the 'United Way' chairperson.

I just signed your name for six hundred more.

I couldn't help noticing the bugs in the program on this old diskette you threw away.

I fixed the bugs and tightened the code from twelve thousand lines to sixteen.

It took me three months to write that program.

I took the liberty of updating your resume.  I'm guessing you'll need it soon.

Let's have a little premeeting to prepare for the meeting tomorrow.

Whoa!  Do you think it's safe to jump right into the premeeting without planning it?

Okay, let's get this preliminary premeeting meeting going.

You think you're funny, but you're not.

The Boss says to Ratbert, <<<
In the short time you've worked in quality assurance, you've found a huge number of flaws in our prototype.
>>>  Ratbert replies, <<<
That's my job!
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
You're jeopardizing our schedule.  The entire project will fail and it's all YOUR fault.
>>>  Ratbert asks, <<<
Why is it MY fault?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
If a tree falls in the forest . . . And we've already sold the tree . . . Does it have quality?
>>>  Ratbert asks, <<<
How many angels can dance on your head?
>>> 
1996-07-03 * 
Wally sits at his desk.  Ratbert enters holding a printout and says, <<<
My quality assurance review of your beta product turned up a few bugs, Wally.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
I've classified the bugs by severity: 1) lethal, 2) boneheaded, 3) vexing.
>>> Wally looks at the printout and asks, <<<
All I see are lethal and vexing.  Where's boneheaded?

I'm trying to rent a stadium to hold the printout.
>>> 
1996-07-02 * 
Ratbert stands on the Boss's desk and says, <<<
I'd be perfect for the job in quality assurance.  Here's my resume.
>>> The Boss looks at the resume and asks, <<<
Are you bothered by the fact that half of your words are spelled wrong?
>>>  Ratbert replies, <<<
Nope!  I'm not even bothered by your anal-retentive behavior.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You're hired.  Your bonus will equal negative 100&#037; of your base salary, okay?
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
I don't see any problem with that.
>>> 
1996-07-01 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Ratbert, my company is hiring for our quality assurance group.  You'd be perfect.
>>>  Ratbert asks, <<<
What would I have to do?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
You would find flaws in our new product, thus making yourself an object of intense hatred and ridicule.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
But then you'd fix those flaws . . . And your respect for me would grow into a special bond of friendship, right?!
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
No, then we ship.
>>> 
1996-06-30 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at a table.  Dilbert holds a device and says, <<<
I call my invention the D-Chip Television Filter.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I feel safer already.
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
It screens out any show with violence.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
There goes the news, sports and dramas.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It also gets rid of shows that feature dishonesty or sexual innuendos.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Goodbye comedy and commercials.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Let's hook it up.
>>> Dilbert sits on the couch holding the remote control and Dogbert sits on the backrest.  Dilbert looks at the television and says, <<<
All we're getting is weather reports.

A huge tornado ripped through a . . .

It works!  The evil can't get to us now, Dogbert.

1996-06-29 *

Please . . . Anything but that . . .

How satisfied are you NOW?

1996-06-28 * 
The Boss and Dogbert sit at a table.  Dogbert shows the Boss a document and says, <<<
Here's my final plan for the company's day care facility.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I call it free range day care.  The children are allowed to roam free among the cubicles.  It's very economical.
>>> Two small children stand in Wally's cubicle.  The boy says, <<<
I don't believe he's really an evil troll.
>>>  The girl says, <<<
Look at the 'Powerpoint' slides he's making.  It's not human.
>>> 
1996-06-27 * 
Dogbert and Alice sit at a table.  Dogbert says, <<<
Alice, I need to gather some requirements before designing the company child care facility.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Do you mind if your children spend the day sewing garments in a windowless room full of illegal aliens?
>>>  Alice replies, <<<
I mind.
>>> Dogbert responds, <<<
I'll put you down as a maybe.
>>>  Alice asks, <<<
Would I get discounts on those garments?
>>> 
1996-06-26 * 
Dogbert stands on a chair across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss asks, <<<
What exactly is the Dogbert Day Care concept?
>>> Dogbert answers, <<<
Progressive companies can provide day care without spending a bundle.
>>> The Boss reads Dogbert's plan and asks, <<<
Wouldn't we spend a fortune on duct tape?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
It's reusable unless it gets slobbered on.
>>> 
1996-06-25 * 
Dilbert sits in his cubicle and thinks, <<<
I could sit here doing nothing.
>>> Dilbert clenches his fists, looks determined and thinks, <<<
Or I could implement a bold quality initiative with the help of my talented and energetic co-workers.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I crack me up.
>>> 
1996-06-24 * 
Alice hands the Boss a document and says, <<<
Here's a draft of my new objectives.  I tried to make them achievable.
>>> The Boss reads, <<<
No matter how stupid my co-workers are, I will not punch a hole in anyone's torso, rip out a vital organ and keep it in my cubicle as a warning to others.
>>> Outside the Boss's office, Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
I hope she gets those objectives approved.

Yes!  It's measurable!

So I've captured all of my career wisdom in this software, which I call the 'Automentor.'
>>> Dilbert sits at his computer and asks, <<<
Automentor, how can I achieve job satisfaction?
>>> The computer replies, <<<
Try giving yourself a massage in your cubicle.
>>> Asok asks, <<<
Automentor, how can I make sure my accomplishments get noticed?
>>> A picture of Dilbert is on the screen.  The software replies, <<<
That's not a problem at this company; nobody accomplishes anything.
>>> Asok asks, <<<
Should I look for a new job?
>>>  The software replies, <<<
Too late.  They don't call this place the 'resume stain' for nothing.
>>> Asok stands behind Dilbert and asks, <<<
How do you handle all the hopelessness?
>>>  Dilbert hums and replies, <<<
I give it to the new guy.
>>> 
1996-06-22 * 
Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
The only employee suggestions that get accepted are the ones that are harmless and stupid.
>>> They sit down at a conference table and Wally continues, <<<
I submitted some harmless and stupid ideas to test my theory.
>>> The Boss sits at his desk and reads a document that says, <<<
Suggestion: Replace all #2 pencils with #4 pencils.  The hard lead lasts longer yet costs the same.
>>>  The Boss thinks, <<<
That could work.
>>> 
1996-06-21 * 
Dilbert and Liz walk outdoors.  Dilbert says, <<<
I was going to get the 'Buns of Steel' video but I'm making excellent progress without it.
>>> Liz says, <<<
When they say steel, it refers to hardness, not weight.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I KNEW it seemed too easy.
>>>  Liz says, <<<
Stay away from large magnets.
>>> 
1996-06-20 * 
The Boss says to his secretary, <<<
Carol, I asked you to enroll me in the Quality College, but the confirmation says Clown College.

It's a prerequisite course.

This is gonna cost me on Secretaries Day.

I hope it's okay to be an angry clown.

The Boss says to Wally and Alice, <<<
Some idiot stood on a chair and fell off.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Now we all have to take twelve hours of chair safety training.
>>>  Wally and Alice wince. During training Alice, Wally and the Boss watch a man standing on his head and spinning on a chair.  The Boss whispers, <<<
Is that a 'do' or a 'not do?'
>>> 
1996-06-18 * 
Dilbert walks by a workman standing on a chair and nailing a sign to the wall.  The sign says, <<<
10 Injury Free Days.
>>> Dilbert hears, <<<
Bam!  Aaaeeii!!  R-r-roll thud.
>>> Dilbert stands over the workman who has fallen off the chair.  Dilbert says, <<<
This is very ironic.
>>>  The workman says, <<<
No, it was ironic when it happened eleven days ago.

1996-06-17 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  Wally says, <<<
The status of my action item is 50&#037; done.

Specifically, I finished the item part but not the action.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Do you have an estimate for when the action will be done?
>>>  Wally answers, <<<
Yes, and that estimate is 100&#037; complete!
>>> 
1996-06-16 * 
The Boss sits at his desk and says, <<<
Dilbert, I've decided to downsize you.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It's nothing personal, just an economic necessity.
>>>  Dilbert tugs nervously at his necktie. The Boss says, <<<
I calculated how much your salary was dragging down the value of my stock options.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Without you, I can afford to go to the movies one additional time per year.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
And let's face it: recreation is important when one has a stressful job.
>>> Dilbert waves his arms and says sarcastically, <<<
Hey, why don't you downsize Wally instead.  You'll save enough in office supplies to buy popcorn too.  Sheesh!
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
Mmm . . .
>>> Wally asks Dilbert, <<<
How'd it go?
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
You know that team-building exercise we did last week?  It didn't take.
>>> 
1996-06-15 * 
Dilbert walks by with a briefcase as the garbage man is emptying a trashcan.  The garbage man says to him, <<<
Dilbert, I notice you've been looking depressed lately.
>>> The garbage man writes on a pad and says, <<<
Here's a prescription for an antidepressant drug.  Be sure to exercise regularly and don't skip meals.
>>> Dilbert says angrily, <<<
What makes you think you're qualified to diagnose my mental health?!!
>>>  The garbage man reaches for the prescription and says, <<<
I'd better double it.
>>> 
1996-06-14 * 
Dilbert and Wally walk down the hall together.  Wally says, <<<
This company makes perfect sense, now that I'm insane.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
For example, it might seem as though we're woefully understaffed, but I can compensate by working smarter not harder.
>>> Wally walks into Dilbert's cubicle in his underwear with a box on his head and a monitor strapped to his chest.  Wally says, <<<
Hey, if I'm capable of working smarter, then why do I work HERE?
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
The healing has begun.
>>> 
1996-06-13 * 
The Boss, Alice, Wally and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  Wally says, <<<
Our objectives are unclear and our mission statement is gibberish . . .
>>> Wally continues, <<<
But thanks to an artificial sense of urgency, I'm working harder than ever!
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
What's the good news you said you have?
>>>  Wally answers, <<<
Apparently I'm insane.  But I'm one of the happy kinds!
>>> 
1996-06-12 * 
Dogbert, the Boss, Alice and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  Dogbert stands on the table, holds up a piece of paper and says, <<<
Your new logo might look like a simple coffee stain, but what does the image say about you?
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
We're sloppy and unimaginative?
>>>  Alice asks, <<<
We give lots of money to consultants and get little in return?
>>> Dogbert looks at the logo and says, <<<
Wow.  This is almost TOO good.
>>>  Dilbert raises his hand and says, <<<
Ooh ooh!  How about 'Our opinions don't matter?'

When will you start?

Dilbert and Liz sit at a table looking at various containers.  Liz says, <<<
These are some of the advanced materials I'm designing at work.  That jar holds a pyrophoric substance.
>>>  Dilbert picks it up and says, <<<
Let's see.
>>> The jar explodes in his face. Dilbert looks charred and small clouds of smoke rise from his head.  He says, <<<
Yep, that's a good batch.
>>>  Liz says, <<<
A person from a smarter gender might have said 'What does "pyrophoric" mean?'
>>> 
1996-06-09 * 
Dilbert walks through the house thinking, <<<
Where's Dogbert?
>>> Dilbert sits on the couch and turns the television on with the remote control.  He thinks, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> On a tv commercial, Dogbert sits at a desk wearing a sorcerer's hat.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Are you gullible?  Do you spend money on stupid stuff?
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Call the 'Dogbert Gullible Friends Hotline' for help.  Only four dollars per minute.

Hello, Dogbert.  I bought an exercise machine and I'm still lazy.

Please hold.
>>>  The woman replies, <<<
Okay.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Call now, and I'll replace your old television with a new one that looks just like it, while you sleep!
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
If you don't have a touch tone phone, stay on the line . . . Until you get one.
>>> 
1996-06-08 * 
Dilbert and Liz walk outdoors.  Liz says, <<<
I can't believe your father has been living in the 'all you can eat' restaurant since 1989!
>>> Liz continues, <<<
You have the oddest family.  What did he look like when you saw him after all these years?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
I haven't seen him yet.  I'm waiting for 'Burrito Night.'"  Liz says, <<<
Now is when you should be saying 'just kidding.'
>>> 
1996-06-07 * 
Dilbert's mother sits in a chair and says into the phone, <<<
Dilbert, I found your father.  He's been at the 'all you can eat' restaurant in the mall since 1989.

He's so literal - he didn't want to leave until it was 'all he could eat.'
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
When's he coming home?
>>>  Dilbert's mother answers, <<<
I'm thinking of joining him.  He got a booth.
>>> 
1996-06-06 * 
Wally and Dilbert sit at a conference table with a vendor.  Wally says, <<<
You must do our bidding, Vendor.  We control your economic future.

Of course, our buying decision will be based solely on quantifiable performance measurements.

1996-06-05 * 
Dilbert and Wally walk down the hall together.  Dilbert says, <<<
Although we are nothing but pond scum in this company . . .
>>> Dilbert continues as they walk into a conference room, <<<
It's nice to know we can still find someone of lower status to torment.
>>> Dilbert and Wally sit at a table with a vendor.  Dilbert says, <<<
You call these brochures?  How can I even consider buying products from a 'ven-duh' such as you?
>>>  Wally reaches for the salesperson's ear and says, <<<
Tell me if this hurts.
>>> 
1996-06-04 * 
Dilbert sits in a chair reading and Dogbert sits on his legs.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Do you see 'time' as a sequence of discrete events or simply a line of perception through infinite possibilities?
>>> Dilbert answers, <<<
I see 'Time' as more of a magazine.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You know these moments we have together - we really must have them less often.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Ask me about 'Life.'

Halt and submit to the mind scan of 'Brainitor, the Guardian of Security.'

The bag contains one computer . . . 'Pentium' processor . . . one gig hard drive . . . highly fragmented . . .

This is vaguely unsettling.

Hi, Phil.
>>> Phil says, <<<
You must choose one of these two hideous fates to pay for your sins.
>>> Phil continues, <<<
You can choose eternal high pay, but all of your work will be burned in front of you at the end of each day . . .
>>> Phil continues, <<<
Or you can choose eternal poverty, but your work will be useful and appreciated.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
WOW!  They're BOTH better than my current job!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Hey, Wally, you might want to get in on this!
>>> Wally confesses, <<<
I watch tv when I'm supposed to be telecommuting.

Dogbert's Dream Analysis.
>>> Dogbert and a man sit at a conference table.  The man says, <<<
I was in a big field full of tofu and carburetors.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
It means you're a gullible moron.  That's $25 please.
>>> A woman tells Dogbert, <<<
Then I was running, running, running against the wind.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
That means you're ugly.
>>> Wally tells Dogbert, <<<
Then the butterfly turned into an opera singer.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
That means you're bald.
>>> Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
Suddenly I saw a new algorythm for data compression.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
It means you're boring.
>>> The Boss tells Dogbert, <<<
Then I told the car dealer I wanted the anti-rust sealant, the extended warranty and the lease option.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
What do you think it means?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
It means I'm going to make some serious money today.
>>> 
1996-05-18 * 
Dogbert stands on Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
With all this talk of 'diversity' there's no mention of the pain we smart creatures endure while surrounded by dolts.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Good point.  I don't know how we do it.
>>> Dogbert walks away saying, <<<
It looks like I'll have to hold secret meetings.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Yeah, our lives are a constant struggle.
>>> 
1996-05-17 * 
The caption says, <<<
'Due diligence' before the merger.
>>>  Alice sits at a table with a man who says, <<<
You must reveal your secrets so my company knows what it's buying.
>>> Alice points to some documents in a binder and says, <<<
All of our projects are doomed.  Most of the good employees left.  Our customers are starting a class action suit . . .
>>> The man says, <<<
At least the building is worth something.
>>>  Alice points to her throat and says, <<<
If you feel a tickle, that's asbestos.
>>> 
1996-05-16 * 
The Boss sits across from two men from the buying company who are sitting on a couch.  One man says, <<<
In the 'due diligence' phase of our merger you will give us access to all of your proprietary information.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Wouldn't that let you know how to crush us competitively?  Couldn't you cancel the merger and take our customers without paying a cent?
>>> As the two men struggle to control themselves, they think, <<<
Must . . . contain maniacal . . . laugh . . .
>>> 
1996-05-15 * 
Dilbert stands with his arms extended and says to the Boss, <<<
I'm paralyzed with fear because of the pending merger.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Thanks to your leadership I've gone from being unmotivated to being inert.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I think I'm advancing to the next phase.  Hello, rigor mortis!!  Take me, I'm ready!!
>>>  The Boss walks away thinking, <<<
It might be time for a morale-boosting potluck lunch.
>>> 
1996-05-14 * 
Alice, Wally, Dilbert and a man from the buying company sit at a conference table.  The man says, <<<
After the merger, we'll reduce staff in areas that are redundant.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I hope the employees of this company will be evaluated fairly compared to those in the buying company.
>>> The man says, <<<
We already have a bald guy.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Does your steal office furniture, too?
>>> 
1996-05-13 * 
The Boss says to Alice, Wally and Dilbert, <<<
The company announced we're being bought by our long-time rival.
>>>  Alice, Wally and Dilbert look surprised. The Boss continues, <<<
Don't worry about layoffs.  They like engineers.  In fact, they already have a division that does what we do!
>>>  Alice throws her hands up, Wally yanks at his tie and Dilbert covers his eyes. The Boss continues, <<<
Except they're younger and they aren't paid as much as we are . . .
>>>  Alice's hair jumps off her head, Wally's skeleton comes out of his mouth and Dilbert's head spins around. 
1996-05-12 * 
The Boss, Alice, Dilbert, Asok, Wally and an executive sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I'd like you all to meet our new vice president in charge of cost containment.
>>> The VP says, <<<
My first priority is to reduce our spiraling expenses for office supplies.
>>> The VP continues, <<<
From now on, your supply cabinet will be locked.
>>> The VP continues, <<<
The only key will be under the control of your bitter and inefficient secretary.  Questions?
>>> Asok raises his hand and says, <<<
I am only an intern so please excuse this naive question . . .
>>> Asok continues, <<<
I've noticed that the employees are all dispirited hollow shells, management is random and our products are shoddy.
>>> Asok asks, <<<
How are you going to solve that by making it hard to get supplies?
>>> The VP looks angry.  Asok says to Wally, <<<
I thought you said they like honesty.
>>>  Wally whispers, <<<
Ask how much he's paid.  It shows you care.
>>> 
1996-05-11 * 
Tina the Tech Writer sits at a table with Dogbert.  Tina says, <<<
I'm a lowly technical writer now, but my goal is to become a famous novelist.
>>> Tina continues, <<<
My plan is to write witty and scathing e-mail messages about co-workers until a publisher gives me an advance.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
They might expect you to write a book at some point.
>>>  Tina yells, <<<
Blood suckers!
>>> 
1996-05-10 * 
A man sits across from Dogbert's desk.  Dogbert reads from a document and says, <<<
According to your occupational preference test, you like to remove vital organs from helpless people.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
That narrows the career choices to doctor or serial killer.  Do you get along with other people?
>>> The man replies, <<<
Other people are insignificant insects.
>>>  Dogbert responds, <<<
We'll have to go to a tie-breaker question.
>>> 
1996-05-09 * 
Wally sits across from Dogbert's desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
You can't expect your employer to take care of you forever, Wally.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Don't expect raises, don't expect to be trained and don't expect a pension.
>>> Wally reaches for a jar on the desk and says, <<<
That's depressing.  I need a sourball.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Those are marbles wrapped in cellophane.
>>> 
1996-05-08 * 
Dogbert sits on the bed watching Dilbert tie his tie.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm going to try my paw at being a career counselor.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Insecure people will seek my advice and I'll tell them to be more self-reliant.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That sounds lazy and unhelpful.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Would you want career advice from somebody who has to work hard?
>>> 
1996-05-07 * 
The caption says, <<<
Catbert, the evil Director of Human Resources.
>>>  Catbert, Wally, Dilbert and Alice sit at a conference table.  Catbert says, <<<
We're moving to 'cafeteria style' benefits.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
Under this system, if you need health care, you wander through the cafeteria asking 'Does anybody know what this red lump is?'
>>> Alice asks, <<<
What if it's a life-threatening problem?
>>>  Catbert replies, <<<
That reminds me, the cafeteria won't be labeling the entrees anymore.
>>> 
1996-05-06 * 
The Boss, Alice, Wally and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  Wally says, <<<
This week I kicked off the 'Wally Compensation Equilibrium Project.'
>>> Wally continues, <<<
My goal is to lower the quality of my work until it is consistent with my salary.
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
I hate the first month after they see their raises.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I'd go on, but I just achieved equilibrium.
>>> 
1996-05-05 * 
The Boss tells Dilbert, <<<
I need to move you one cubicle down.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Why?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
That way my people will still be in a square pattern.
>>> The Boss explains, <<<
You're in a random pattern now.  The symmetry is bad.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You want me to waste two days of work to move . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I'll have no phone and no network connection for a week . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I'll have to order new business cards and update my cubicle address on dozens of records.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
And you still won't have a SQUARE because there are FIVE of us.
>>> A man stands in the door of Dilbert's cubicle holding a box.  He tells Dilbert, <<<
I got downsized.  Apparently somebody complained that I formed a pentagon.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
That can happen.
>>> 
1996-05-04 * 
Wally hands the Boss a document and says, <<<
Here are my budget estimates for the year.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Thanks to management bungling and indecision, I plan to use no capital for several months followed by a reckless year-end orgy of acquisition.
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Is that what you were looking for?
>>>  The Boss responds, <<<
Tell me again what 'capital' is.
>>> 
1996-05-03 * 
Alice, the Boss and Dilbert stand at a conference table looking at a document.  The Boss says, <<<
We'll have to eliminate a few steps in order to hit the market window.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I think we can get rid of market research and technical testing.  They're basically 'overhead.'
>>> The Boss writes on the chart and says, <<<
Gone!  Now we'll hit the window!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
. . . Like a bird.
>>> 
1996-05-02 * 
Dilbert examines some cables in the Boss's office and says, <<<
Here's your problem.  The connection to the network is broken.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Uh-oh.  It's a 'token ring' LAN.  That means the token fell out and it's in this room someplace.
>>> Wally and Dilbert stand outside the Boss's office, watching the Boss crawl around on the floor.  Wally says, <<<
You are the wind beneath my wings.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I'll wait a week then tell him the token must be in the 'Ethernet.'
>>> 
1996-05-01 * 
Wally says to Alice, <<<
I just watched the mandatory video on sexual harassment.  It worked!
>>> Wally continues, <<<
In only thirty minutes, that video corrected a billion years of evolution.  Do something sexy and watch me ignore it!
>>> After Alice shoves Wally's head into the wall, he says, <<<
I probably shouldn't have fast-forwarded through the boring parts.
>>> 
1996-04-30 * 
Wally, Dilbert, Alice and the Boss sit at a conference table.  Wally says, <<<
I'm pleased to report another banner week of accomplishments!
>>> Wally continues, <<<
I streamlined my business processes while honing my participatory style and my proactive attitude, all while valuing diversity!
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
You watched the mandatory training videos?
>>>  Wally adds, <<<
And I lost my free will!
>>> 
1996-04-29 * 
Catbert stands behind Wally's desk and says, <<<
I've come to give you 'employee orientation,' Wally.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
But I've worked here for years.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
You still have a glimmer of hope.  You'll have to watch this mandatory training video.
>>> Wally sits in front of a television and VCR.  The video begins, <<<
So, you still have hope . . .
>>>  Catbert massages Wally's temples and says, <<<
Relax . . . Let it go.
>>> 
1996-04-28 * 
The Boss approaches Dilbert and Alice carrying a box.  He says, <<<
Great news!  The company set a new record for profits!
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
That means t-shirts for everyone!
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
You can choose from sizes 'small,' 'petite' or 'elfin.'
>>> Alice holds up a shirt and asks, <<<
Shouldn't these have the company name or logo on them?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Hey, that's an idea for next year!
>>> Alice reads the label and says, <<<
It's 1 percent cotton, 99 percent 'miscellaneous' and all hand-made by authentic slave laborers.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
That's great!  With slave labor you don't have the problem that the shirts made on Fridays aren't as good!
>>> Alice asks, <<<
Do you ever worry that our career expectations have gotten too low?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Don't go there, Alice.
>>>  Wally walks in wearing a small shirt and says, <<<
'Casual day,' here I come!
>>> 
1996-04-27 * 
Alice stands at a vending machine.  Wally points to a beeper on his hip  and says to Alice, <<<
I got myself a little work-avoidance device.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
If I want to leave a meeting early, I just look down and say 'uh-oh' and scurry away.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
What's the pager number in case I need you?
>>>  Wally says, <<<
You're not quite grasping the concept here, Alice.
>>> 
1996-04-26 * 
Dilbert hands a time sheet to a woman at a desk and says, <<<
Here's my time sheet, including guesses for the next two days so I can meet your arbitrary clerical deadline.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
If anything important comes up, I'll ignore it to preserve the integrity of the time-reporting system.
>>> The woman asks, <<<
Are you finished annoying me yet?
>>>  Dilbert answers, <<<
According to my time sheet I'll be here for another 14 minutes.
>>> 
1996-04-25 * 
The caption says, <<<
Experiment #1: I am exposing a rat to my company's marketing plan.
>>>  Dilbert shows a copy of the plan to Ratbert. The caption says, <<<
He seems to have no adverse response to the introduction and background.
>>>  Ratbert hums as he reads the plan.  Dilbert takes notes. The caption says, <<<
This is already far more exposure than humans could tolerate.
>>>  A large bump appears on Ratbert's head and he says, <<<
Sales projections . . . brain tumor . . . get Tylenol . . .
>>> 
1996-04-24 * 
An employee from marketing, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  The woman says, <<<
And that's the marketing plan.  Any comments?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It appears to be a bunch of obvious generalities and wishful thinking with no apparent business value.
>>> The woman thinks, <<<
Marketing didn't turn out to be the glamour career I expected.
>>>  Wally shows his copy of the plan to Dilbert and says, <<<
I circled all the words you won't find in any dictionary.
>>> 
1996-04-23 * 
Dilbert and Wally stand in the office kitchen.  As he pours himself a cup of coffee, Wally says, <<<
So I'm thinking I'll resign, then I'll reapply for my current job at a higher salary.
>>> As they walk back to their cubicles, Dilbert says, <<<
That's a good plan except for the fact that you're thoroughly unqualified for your current job.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I need to share my unrealistic plans with a friend who isn't an engineer.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I'm more of a co-worker than a friend, per se.
>>> 
1996-04-22 * 
Wally sits across from Catbert's desk.  Catbert says, <<<
Wally, it might not seem fair that new employees are paid more than you . . .
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
But you could always quit and then reapply for your old job at a higher salary.
>>> Wally says angrily, <<<
I just might do that!!
>>>  Catbert says, <<<
Would you mind rubbing this catnip all over your body first?
>>> 
1996-04-21 * 
A man says to Dilbert, <<<
Yo, Dil-man!
>>>  Dilbert sits at his desk and thinks, <<<
Uh-oh, it's Ken from sales.
>>> Ken says, <<<
I told our biggest customers how great our next product will be.  Now nobody will buy our current product.
>>> Ken asks, <<<
When will the new version be available?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
In a year or two.
>>> Ken looks shocked. Ken says, <<<
Hmm . . . I seem to have single-handedly destroyed an entire product line.
>>> Ken continues, <<<
Luckily our biggest competitor is hiring sales people.  And I'm betting THEY'LL have brisk sales this year!  Commissions galore!
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
If there's justice in this world, the idiots will be punished . . .
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
. . . Before they get promoted.
>>>  The Boss tells Dilbert, <<<
Um . . . We need the new version by Tuesday.
>>> 
1996-04-20 * 
Dogbert, who is wearing a wizard's hat, stands on the desk in Alice's cubicle.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Have my poems and dances healed your soul yet, Alice?  The company cares about your total well being.
>>>  Alice says, <<<
Excuse me.
>>> Alice leans over the cubicle wall and shouts at the Boss, <<<
We want more MONEY, not more dancing dogs!!! M-O-N-E-Y!! The Boss and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
So you're saying those primal screams are healthy?  Can you teach me to do it?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Here's my invoice - go wild.
>>> 
1996-04-19 * 
Dogbert, who is wearing a wizard's hat, stands on a chair across from the Boss's desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
I can make your employees more creative and spiritually fulfilled.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I use my special blend of poetry and dance to touch their souls.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Okay.  You're hired.
>>> Dogbert stands on a desk and dances while Alice, Wally and Dilbert watch.  Dogbert recites, <<<
There once was a dog with a hat . . . Who got paid to dance like that . . .

Hey!  My soul just healed!
>>> 
1996-04-18 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Asok the Intern sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
It has come to my attention that 40&#037; of your sick days are on Fridays and Mondays.  This is unacceptable.
>>> Asok throws his head back and shouts, <<<
Ha ha ha!!!  That's a good one!!!
>>> Asok sees the serious look on the Boss's face.  He turns to Dilbert and Wally and says, <<<
Please tell me he was kidding.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Welcome to hell, kid.
>>> 
1996-04-17 * 
The secretary reads a document and says to the Boss, <<<
Oh my!  This is shocking!
>>>  The Boss asks, <<<
What?
>>> The secretary says, <<<
40&#037; of all sick days taken by your staff are Fridays and Mondays!
>>> The Boss walks away saying, <<<
What kind of idiot do they think I am?
>>>  The secretary says, <<<
Not an idiot savant.  They can do math.
>>> 
1996-04-16 * 
The night shift manager brings a dog into Alice's cubicle and says to Alice, <<<
This dog is specially trained to detect wasted resources.
>>> As the dog begins sniffing, the night manager continues, <<<
He'll help me find out why your project is behind schedule even after adding me as manager.
>>> The dog holds an arrow with his tail and points it at the night manager.  The manager says, <<<
We'll begin as soon as he's done playing around.
>>> 
1996-04-15 * 
The Boss appears in the door of Alice's cubicle and says, <<<
Alice, you've been working eighteen hours a day.  I realized I must add a person to the effort.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
So I hired a night shift manager.  After I go home at five o'clock he'll take over and ask why you're behind schedule.
>>> The night shift manager says to Alice, <<<
I like my status reports rendered in 3-D, but don't spend a lot of time on it.
>>> 
1996-04-14 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert stand in front of the Boss's desk.  Dilbert says, <<<
Dogbert would like to speak with you about the changes you made to my engineering proposal.
>>> Dilbert lifts Dogbert onto the desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
While Dilbert was getting his masters degree in electrical engineering . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
You were majoring in art history so you could look at pictures of naked statues.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Dilbert often contributes articles to technology publications.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
You, on the other hand, rub those same publications with a nickel, looking for hidden 'scratch and sniff' panels.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
In summary . . .
>>> Dogbert shouts, <<<
Never question an engineer's opinion, you thundering moron!
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert sit at a table.  Dilbert says, <<<
Nicely done, but I wouldn't have said 'thundering.'"  Dogbert reads the proposal and says, <<<
What were you drinking when you wrote this piece of crud?
>>> 
1996-04-13 * 
Dilbert looks over Alice's shoulder at her monitor.  Alice points to the screen and says, <<<
The internal job postings are out.  Here's a job I'd love.
>>> Alice reads, <<<
Experience required: the candidate must be a guy named Eric, pot-bellied, nearsighted, must drive a red Ford Bronco.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
They might have someone in mind already.

If I squint . . . and leave my 'control top' pantyhose at home . . .

My assistant, Bob the Dinosaur, will now demonstrate how to give a cat a 'fur wedgie.'

It probably fell into a crack.

1996-04-11 * 
Dilbert arrives at home carrying a briefcase.  Dogbert sits on the couch reading the newspaper.  Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
Today was a bad day.  First the vending machine stole my money . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
. . . And by the end of the day I had been sentenced to death by the director of human resources . . .
>>>  Dogbert reads and hums as he ignores Dilbert. Still reading the paper, Dogbert says, <<<
I've become totally desensitized to tragic news!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
The execution is scheduled for tomorrow.  I should call in sick.
>>> 
1996-04-10 * 
Catbert says to Dilbert, <<<
This report says you went nuts at a vending machine because it took your money.
>>>  Dilbert sits with his arms crossed over his chest. Catbert continues, <<<
The company used to offer counseling in these cases.  But we found it was more economical to apply the death penalty.
>>>  Dilbert looks shocked. Dilbert asks, <<<
What?!  How is that possible?
>>>  Catbert replies, <<<
I'm not sure yet.  You're too big for the microwave oven . . .
>>> 
1996-04-09 * 
Dilbert stands in front of a soda vending machine.  He pushes a button and says angrily, <<<
Stupid machine, you've taken my coins and with them my sunny disposition.

The executive review board meeting is canceled.  I hope you didn't work too hard preparing for it.

Must . . . control fist . . . of . . . death . . .

Unlike Alice, I saw it coming and did no work whatsoever.

Did you see THAT coming, Nostradamus?

What does this do to headcount?

Go home, Dilbert.  Relax!  You're working too hard!

Relax!  Go home!  Shoo!

How can I relax AND do urgent work at the same time?

Work smarter, not harder.

Mercifully, the angel of cynicism appears.
>>>  Dogbert flies up to Dilbert and says, <<<
Slap something together in the morning.  He won't look at it anyway.

Freedom's just another word for not caring about the quality of your work!

1996-04-06 * 
Ratbert stands on Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
I quit my job as vice president of marketing . . .
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
I was losing my scruples . . . becoming unscrupulous.  Yes, I learned a valuable lesson about scruples.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
And that lesson would be?
>>>  Ratbert answers, <<<
It's fun to say 'scruples.'
>>> 
1996-04-05 * 
Ratbert, Wally, Dilbert and Alice sit at a conference table.  Ratbert says, <<<
I had years of valuable experience as a rodent before I became vice president of marketing.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
My marketing plan is simple.  Each of you will cling to the leg of a technology columnist until we get some good press.
>>> Dilbert approaches a technology columnist and says, <<<
It looks like you're full.
>>>  The man has people clinging to both legs.  He responds, <<<
You can cling to the cat until a space opens.
>>> 
1996-04-04 * 
Ratbert sits across from a man's desk.  The man says, <<<
Mister Ratbert, I don't think I can hire a rat to be our vice president of marketing.  You need experience in the technology industry.
>>> Ratbert responds, <<<
I spent a week in a dumpster at Procter and Gamble.
>>> The man says, <<<
Close enough!  Welcome to the team!
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
I'll bring some cronies with me.  They're flies.
>>> 
1996-04-03 * 
Dogbert says to Ratbert, <<<
Remember everything I taught you, Ratbert.  If you can pass yourself off as a corporate vice president, I'll win my bet.
>>> Ratbert stands on a desk and says to Wally as he walks by, <<<
Yo, Headcount!  If you have any issues, put together an action plan.  Our people are the best.  Don't spend money.
>>> Wally asks Alice, <<<
Do you think he's really a vice president?
>>>  Alice answers, <<<
Maybe.  But I'm not ready to rule out 'annoying rodent' yet.
>>>  In the background Ratbert says, <<<
Quality.
>>> 
1996-04-02 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk and Dogbert sits on the desk behind him.  Dilbert says, <<<
I wish I had an Ivy League degree so I could be promoted to vice president.
>>>  Dogbert responds, <<<
You don't need one.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's impossible to be a vice president without one.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I'll bet $100 I can turn a rat into a vice president.
>>> Dogbert and Ratbert stand in front of a mirror.  Dogbert says, <<<
That was good, but try saying it as though your soul just abandoned your body.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
We've reorganized to focus on our core competency.

The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
In an effort to boost sales, laptop computers have been given to every member of the sales force.

That's you.
>>>  The man stares straight ahead as he replies, <<<
MY name is Barry??
>>> The Boss says, <<<
This is for working hundreds of hours of overtime.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
While you quitters were going home by 9 pm every night . . .
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Barry remained at work staring at his computer for hours.
>>>  Barry eats the bonus check. The Boss continues, <<<
It's important to recognize extra effort.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Sadly, that's the end of the special bonus budget for the year.
>>>  Barry burps. Wally says, <<<
In retrospect, I shouldn't have told Barry that his screen saver is an epic miniseries.
>>>  Dilbert and Alice glare at him. 
1996-03-30 * 
The caption says, <<<
Performance Review.
>>>  Tina the Tech Writer sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
Your main accomplishment was the department newsletter which was both uninteresting and unimportant.  You get no raise.
>>> Tina looks shocked and says, <<<
The newsletter was YOUR idea, and it's boring because most of the articles are contributed by my idiotic co-workers.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You don't seem to understand the value of teamwork.
>>>  Tina replies, <<<
I understand its value; it just cost me a two-percent raise.
>>> 
1996-03-29 * 
Tina the Tech Writer approaches Wally and says, <<<
Wally, I'm hoping you'll agree to write about your project for the newsletter . . .
>>> Tina continues, <<<
And in the grand tradition of engineering, I expect you'll give this the lowest priority, thus making me despise you.
>>> Wally says lovingly, <<<
So . . . are you saying you don't despise me NOW?
>>>  Tina screams, <<<
We are NOT having a moment here!
>>> 
1996-03-28 * 
Tina the Tech Writer and Dilbert sit in Dilbert's cubicle.  Tina says, <<<
At the risk of dying from boredom, I must interview you for the department newsletter.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Let me give you some background before I talk about my project . . .
>>> Tina ignores Dilbert and writes, <<<
'The project is good,' quipped the engineer.
>>>  Dilbert continues, <<<
. . . So there I am in my mom's Fallopian tube . . .
>>> 
1996-03-27 * 
Tina the Tech Writer, Asok the Intern and Ratbert sit at a conference table.  Tina says, <<<
Let's get one thing straight before we start writing the department newsletter . . .
>>> Tina continues, <<<
I'm an experienced technical writer.  You are an intern and a rat, respectively.  Therefore I will be the editor.
>>> Asok says, <<<
I have no skills whatsoever.  Therefore I'll be executive editor.
>>>  Ratbert asks, <<<
Is 'publisher' taken?
>>> 
1996-03-26 * 
The Boss, Tina the Tech Writer, Asok the Intern and Ratbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I want you three to write the department newsletter.  It's an important, high-profile assignment.
>>> Tina says, <<<
I am an experienced technical writer.  You have placed me on a project with an intern and a rodent.
>>> Tina continues, <<<
MY next raise will depend on THEIR performance.
>>>  Asok says, <<<
I'll do the sports page!
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
I'll be the topless model on page two.
>>> 
1996-03-25 * 
Dilbert, Wally, the Boss and another employee sit at a conference table.  Dilbert holds a software box and says, <<<
At long last our product is complete.  It ships tomorrow.
>>> The other employee says, <<<
That's terrific.  I only have a few additional features to add and the marketing department will be happy.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Okay.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I believe that our customers want hardware, not software.
>>>  Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
It's times like this I wish I were a psychopath.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
You're not?
>>> 
1996-03-24 * 
Alice says to the Boss, <<<
Here's the analysis you asked for . . . I worked all night.
>>> Alice continues, <<<
But you said this was vital for your meeting today so I know it was worth the effort.
>>> The Boss sits at his desk reading the report.  He says, <<<
This is excellent work, Alice.
>>> Alice closes her eyes and thinks, <<<
A rare compliment; it was all worthwhile.
>>> As Alice walks away the Boss says, <<<
I'll use it as backup material.
>>> Alice says angrily, <<<
Backup?!!  Nobody looks at backup material!
>>> Alice says, <<<
I'm going to grab your pointy hair, yank you out of that cheap suit and fling your naked body down the hall.
>>> The Boss lies in the hall with no clothes on.  Wally says, <<<
She's always irritable the week before her performance review cycle.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Her distance improved this year.
>>> 
1996-03-23 * 
Alice walks away from Dilbert's cubicle and says, <<<
I don't believe men have a special chromosome to tell them which assignments are a waste of time.
>>>  Dilbert leans out of his cubicle and says, <<<
We do.
>>> Alice approaches Asok and thinks, <<<
I will test the theory on young Asok the intern.
>>>  Asok looks at the documents Alice is holding and says, <<<
Mmm . . . The sweet smell of unnecessary work.
>>> Alice thinks, <<<
Maybe men are more perceptive than you'd think.
>>>  Asok thinks, <<<
She's aroused.  I'll make my move.
>>> 
1996-03-22 * 
Dilbert reclines in his chair and hums.  Alice asks him, <<<
Why aren't you slaving away, preparing for the executive review board meeting?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
I have the male 'work avoidance chromosome.'  I can detect unnecessary work, thereby avoiding it.
>>> Alice says angrily, <<<
We ALL have to be ready to present something!
>>>  Wally peers over the cubicle wall and say, <<<
Could you hold it down?  I'm trying to sleep.
>>> 
1996-03-21 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  The Boss peers into Dilbert's cubicle and says, <<<
I want everyone to prepare a presentation for the executive review board.  Urgent.
>>> Dilbert makes sniffing noises and says, <<<
What's that smell?  Yes!!!  . . . It's the scent of unnecessary work for a meeting that will be canceled.
>>> Wally peers over the cubicle wall and says to Dilbert, <<<
Did you smell the unnecessary work?  We can ignore it!
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
It's like popcorn for the soul.
>>>  Alice sits in her cubicle thinking, <<<
Urgent.
>>> 
1996-03-20 * 
Alice peers into Asok's cubicle and says, <<<
Asok, come quickly!  It's an emergency!
>>> Alice and Asok stand in front of a heating duct.  Alice says, <<<
You must crawl through the Jeffries tube and shut down the furnace before it fries us all!
>>> Asok's legs stick protrude from the heating duct.  Alice holds a sign that says, <<<
Spank the intern $0.50.
>>>  Alice says to Dilbert, <<<
Today young Asok learns that life is NOT like 'Star Trek.'
>>> 
1996-03-19 * 
Dilbert says to Asok, <<<
As an intern, your assignments won't be as glamorous as mine, but you'll gain experience.
>>> The Boss peers into Dilbert's cubicle and says, <<<
Dilbert, I need a status report on the mouse pad inventory.
>>> Dilbert says to Asok, <<<
See?  My assignment has the word 'status' built right in.
>>>  Asok looks worried and thinks, <<<
Danger!  Alert!
>>> 
1996-03-18 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert and Alice, <<<
Hey, everybody.  Meet our new intern, Asok.
>>> Alice picks up Asok and says, <<<
I hope this one's sturdier than the last one.
>>> Wally shouts over the cubicle walls, <<<
My staple remover is broken.  Somebody toss that intern to me!
>>> 
1996-03-17 * 
Dogbert sits on the couch backrest.  Dilbert says, <<<
I have an ethical question, Dogbert.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I'm here to help.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Is it better to give customers a low quality product in a timely fashion . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Or is it better to lie about product availability until the bugs are fixed?
>>> Dogbert snaps his paw and replies, <<<
I will need my assistant, Ratbert, to address your ethical question.
>>> Ratbert stands next to Dogbert on the backrest.  Dogbert says, <<<
Let's say Ratbert is a trusting and innocent customer.
>>> Dogbert slaps Ratbert on the back and says, <<<
Suppose somebody abuses his trust like this . . .
>>> Ratbert falls between the couch cushions.  Dilbert sits with his leg crossed under him and looks at Ratbert. Dilbert asks, <<<
How does this relate to my situation?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
To be honest, I wasn't listening to you.
>>> 
1996-03-16 * 
Wally and Dilbert stand in front of the Boss's desk.  Dilbert says, <<<
Wally and I started our own company.  We're selling the product that you said nobody wants.
>>>  Wally adds, <<<
Soon we will be rich.
>>> As they dance around the office, Dilbert says, <<<
We do our victory jig in your face.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Ba-bum" as the shakes back and forth. Wally and Dilbert are sobbing in the hallway.  Alice asks, <<<
When he showed you your employment agreement - where you gave all patent rights to this company - what part of the jig were you doing?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Turbo mooning.
>>> 
1996-03-15 * 
Dogbert, Dilbert and Wally sit at a table.  Dogbert says, <<<
The business plan for your start-up is idiotic but I'm going to provide the venture capital funding anyway.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
We'll generate lots of media hype, go public and make millions by shafting greedy and ignorant investors.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
The Latin word for 'close your eyes and open your mouth' is 'prospectus.'"  Wally says, <<<
This is exactly why I'm afraid of dogs.
>>> 
1996-03-14 * 
Dilbert and Wally stand in front of Ratbert who is standing on a desk.  Dilbert says, <<<
Ratbert, we'd like you to be the Director of Marketing for the company we're starting.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
Okay!  What do I do?
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
Be as annoying and illogical as you can.  We'll whack you in the head with balled-up socks to make you shut up.
>>> Ratbert lies on the table after being beaten with socks.  Dilbert says, <<<
It's definitely better to be an owner than an employee.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Let's link his salary to earnings!  Hee hee!
>>> 
1996-03-13 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
It has come to my attention that some employees are running side businesses from their cubicles.
>>>  Dilbert responds, <<<
Really?
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I don't want to see any signs of that in my department.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Fair enough.
>>> As the Boss walks away Dilbert asks, <<<
What about 'Yellow Pages' ads?
>>>  On Dilbert's cubicle there is a sign that says, <<<
Walbert Inc.
>>>  Above the other cubicles there are signs that say, <<<
Software Outlet,
>>> <<<
Sale,
>>> <<<
Palms Read $25,
>>> and <<<
Shoe World.
>>> 
1996-03-12 * 
Dilbert says to Wally, <<<
If this company won't use our product idea let's quit and start our own business!
>>> Wally responds, <<<
Why quit?  We can run our new company from our cubicles and get paid too.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Wouldn't that be immoral?
>>>  Wally says, <<<
That's only an issue for people who aren't already in hell.
>>> 
1996-03-11 * 
Wally and Dilbert stand with the Boss.  Dilbert says, <<<
Wally and I came up with a great new product idea!
>>> A voice says over an intercom, <<<
Inspiration alert in effect!!
>>>  Another voice says, <<<
Danger!  New idea!
>>>  An arm extends down and drops a metal casing onto the Boss's head. The intercom says, <<<
State your idea now.
>>>  There is a large mallet poised over Dilbert's head that has written on it, <<<
Crush-O-Matic.
>>>  Dilbert says to Wally, <<<
Um, you tell him.
>>> 
1996-03-10 * 
The panel is titled, <<<
Mysteries Revealed.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
How do ceiling tiles get damaged?
>>> The caption says, <<<
It begins with a lowly engineer who makes a technology decision.
>>>  Dilbert sits at his desk humming. The caption says, <<<
The engineer writes up his recommendation.
>>>  Dilbert hands the Boss a report and says, <<<
Ten pages.
>>> The caption says, <<<
The Boss summarizes it for the executive director.
>>>  The Boss hands the director a document and says, <<<
One-page summary.
>>> The caption says, <<<
The executive director summarizes it for the vice president.
>>>  The executive puts a transparency on the overhead projector and says, <<<
Three bullet points . . .
>>> The caption says, <<<
The VP summarizes it for the president.
>>>  The VP says, <<<
Nice necktie.
>>>  The president replies, <<<
Thanks.  Have some stock options.
>>> The caption says, <<<
The president sees a CNN report and makes a technology decision.
>>>  The president sits in a chair watching television with his feet resting on the VP's back.  A newscaster says, <<<
Interactive holographs are hot!
>>>  The president says, <<<
Get me some of that!
>>> The caption says, <<<
The engineer is assigned to justify the president's technology decision.
>>>  Dilbert's feet hang from the ceiling and he says, <<<
Ouch.
>>>  The Boss thinks, <<<
He took that well.
>>> 
1996-03-09 * 
Dilbert says to the new VP, <<<
We planned a dazzling demo for you, but as you can see we're being visited by the dark angel of demos.
>>> From inside the monitor Phil says, <<<
The demo is a sham.  Their project is doomed.  Cut their funding before your name is associated with it.
>>>  The Boss and the new VP look shocked. Dilbert thinks, <<<
The worst is over.
>>>  Phil continues, <<<
Look at some of the pictures the 'boys' store on the file server.
>>> 
1996-03-08 * 
Dilbert stands in front of a table with a computer monitor on it.  Wally is under the table pretending to be a 3-D interface.  The Boss says to Dilbert nervously, <<<
Our new VP is coming.  Is the demo of our holographic interface ready?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Everything should be fine . . . Unless we're suddenly visited by the dark angel of product demos . . .
>>> Phil appears inside the monitor next to Wally and says, <<<
Hello-o-o, Wally.  Did somebody say 'demo?'"  Wally looks shocked.  Dilbert says to the new VP, <<<
I'm Dilbert; loyal peon.
>>> 
1996-03-07 * 
Dilbert stands next to a table covered with a tablecloth.  A computer monitor sits on the table.  Dilbert says, <<<
We had to cut some corners to get the demo ready this soon.
>>> Wally's head pops up into the monitor. Dilbert explains, <<<
Wally is under the table.  He'll pretend to be the 3-D interface that we could build if we weren't doing useless demos.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
He's a little fuzzy.  Can you adjust it?
>>>  Dilbert hands him an electric shaver and says, <<<
Try the electric shaver.
>>> 
1996-03-06 * 
The Boss peers into Dilbert's cubicle and asks, <<<
Could you do a demo of the new product for our VP next week?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Well . . . That would delay the ship date, lower morale and create an unending demand for more unproductive demos . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Logically, since your objective is to show that we're doing valuable work . . .
>>>  The Boss interrupts, <<<
And we'll need a banner that says 'Quality.'
>>> 
1996-03-05 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at a table reading documents.  Dilbert says, <<<
I have to turn this fifty-page proposal into a one-paragraph executive summary for our CEO.  It's impossible.
>>>  Dogbert responds, <<<
Simple.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
How about 'give us three million dollars so we can buy cool technology, pump up our resumes and escape this festering boil you call a company?'
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I feel obligated to say something about our customers.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
How about 'I'm glad I'm not one of them.'
>>> 
1996-03-04 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk.  The Boss hands him a document and says, <<<
Add an executive summary to the approval page.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Keep it simple.  Our executives don't understand as much about technology as I do.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How could they know less than you do?  You haven't figured out how to make your car go uphill.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Wrong; I got AAA road service.
>>> 
1996-03-03 * 
The Boss tells Dilbert, <<<
I want you to interview the new candidate for engineering.  Don't reveal any ugly truths.
>>> Dilbert and a woman sit at a conference table.  Dilbert says, <<<
At this company we're dedicated to the principle of employee empowerment, Jennifer.
>>> Jennifer asks, <<<
The 'principle of employee empowerment'?
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>>  Jennifer asks, <<<
Why would you have a special phrase for something like that?
>>> Jennifer continues, <<<
If you could really make decisions on your own it would never occur to you to invent a phrase for it.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
My shields are down . . . A hull breach is imminent . . .
>>>  Jennifer says, <<<
Just don't tell me you have 'quality teams.'
>>> Dilbert stands up and screams, <<<
Run for it, Jennifer!!!  It's too late for me but you can save yourself!!!  Run!!!
>>> Dilbert's clothes are tattered and his glasses are bent.  Wally says, <<<
Whoa!  Hull breach.  Any survivors?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
One.  I had to jettison my dignity but she made it to the escape pod.
>>> 
1996-03-02 * 
Dogbert, Wally, Dilbert, Alice and another employee sit at a conference table.  Dogbert says, <<<
I think you'll agree that this meeting went smoothly with me as facilitator.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
The breakthrough was when I realized I was the only one here with anything valuable to say.
>>> Dogbert concludes, <<<
Let's have a moment of silence to honor me for my brilliant work despite being surrounded by dolts.
>>>  Everyone at the table looks angry. 
1996-03-01 * 
Dogbert, Alice, Wally and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  Dogbert says, <<<
I've been asked to facilitate this meeting.  I alone will determine who can speak.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I'd like to begin with a raw display of my power.
>>>  You may not speak.
>>> Dogbert turns to Wally and says, <<<
Hey, Wally . . . Did you ever hear of a thing called exercise?
>>>  Wally strains to keep from speaking. 
1996-02-29 * 
Dogbert stands on a desk chair.  Dilbert asks him, <<<
Dogbert, I need you to facilitate some meetings.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
What kind of meetings?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
We're creating a process to fix our product development process.  But first we're having some preplanning meetings . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
 . . . to decide on a project name.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
How about 'Death Spiral?'
>>> 
1996-02-28 * 
The Boss, Wally, Dilbert and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss asks, <<<
You haven't heard what the problem is yet; how can you recommend building a database to solve it??
>>> Wally says, <<<
We always build a database.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
And we'll need coffee mugs for the project team.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The PROBLEM is that we have poor processes.
>>>  Wally responds, <<<
That could be the slogan on our mugs!
>>> 
1996-02-27 * 
The Boss, Wally and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I just got our consultant's report.  He's identified our biggest problem.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I recommend that we build a tracking database.
>>>  Dilbert adds, <<<
We can put it on the network.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Would you like to hear what the problem is first?
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I hate to dwell on the negative.
>>>  Dilbert adds, <<<
We like databases.
>>> 
1996-02-26 * 
Dilbert stands in front of his open closet and says, <<<
I hate my shirts.  Each one has either a stain or a missing button.
>>> Dilbert examines a shirt on a hanger and says, <<<
They say engineers are not concerned with fashion, but that's not fair.
>>> Dilbert holds up two shirts and asks Dogbert who is sitting on the bed, <<<
Which stain goes with this tie?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Definitely the marinara.
>>> 
1996-02-25 * 
Dilbert sits on the couch and Dogbert sits on the armrest.  Dilbert says, <<<
I'm embarrassed to work at my company, Dogbert.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
We can't even pay a simple invoice in less than six months.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
First it comes to our mail room for aging.
>>>  Two men stand in a pile of mail.  One says, <<<
Do we like Dilbert?
>>>  The other man replies, <<<
Bad haircut.  Penalty box.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Months later it gets to our department secretary.
>>>  Dilbert says to the secretary, <<<
It's urgent.
>>>  She replies, <<<
I'll start ignoring it immediately.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Eventually my boss gets it.  He uses it to demonstrate his inability to grasp the concept of time.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Let's get some more bids.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
That was the PAST.  This is the PRESENT.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
If it makes it to the accounts payable group, it will be eaten by trolls.
>>>  A troll says, <<<
No, thanks.  I'm full.
>>>  Another troll takes a bite out of the invoice and says, <<<
Just a taste.
>>> Dilbert asks Dogbert, <<<
How would you protect your reputation if you were associated with something so pathetic?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I'd tell everybody that the doofy guy is my butler.  Hypothetically.
>>> 
1996-02-24 * 
Dilbert points to a diagram on an overhead projector.  Dilbert says to the Boss, <<<
You saved one million dollars by having programmers in Elbonia write software for us.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But we wasted four million dollars trying to debug the software.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
And the entire staff of our quality assurance group quit to become mimes.
>>>  The Boss responds, <<<
Let's blame the mimes; they won't talk.
>>> 
1996-02-23 * 
Dilbert perches on a rock using a laptop.  He says to two Elbonians, <<<
Before I accept the software you wrote under contract, tell me what development methodology you use.
>>> One Elbonian says, <<<
We hold village meetings to boast of our skills and curse the devil-spawned end-users.
>>>  The other Elbonian adds, <<<
Sometimes we juggle.
>>> The first Elbonian continues, <<<
At the last minute we slam out some code and go roller skating.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I would find this humorous if not for the pig on my back.
>>>  A pig clings to Dilbert lovingly. 
1996-02-22 * 
The caption says, <<<
Somewhere in Elbonia.
>>>  Dilbert says to two Elbonians, <<<
I've been assigned to check the software you're writing for us under contract.
>>> One Elbonian says, <<<
The documentation is written in our own Elbonian language.
>>>  The other asks, <<<
Is that a problem?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's better than I'd hoped.  I was afraid nobody here knew how to write.
>>>  An Elbonian responds, <<<
Writing is easy.  Someday we hope to read, too.
>>> 
1996-02-21 * 
Alice says to Dilbert, <<<
I heard that our software development work has been moved to the tiny nation of Elbonia.
>>>  Dilbert responds, <<<
Things can't get worse than that.
>>> The Boss approaches Dilbert and says, <<<
Dilbert, you're in charge of integrating the Elbonian's software with our existing systems.
>>>  Dilbert looks stunned. Dilbert says to Alice, <<<
Okay, NOW it can't get any worse.
>>>  The Boss adds, <<<
You might want to get a tuberculosis vaccination.
>>> 
1996-02-20 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
I moved our software development work to the impoverished nation of Elbonia.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I'm brilliant.  They write high-quality code for six cents a day!  There's no risk!
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Red alert!
>>> In Elbonia, an Elbonian wearing a box on his head says, <<<
Tomorrow, YOU be the computer.
>>>  Another Elbonian stands in front of him pretending to type on a keyboard. 
1996-02-19 * 
Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss points to a diagram created with an overhead projector and says, <<<
This 3-D colored pie chart shows an unexplained rise in expenses.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
You each get a binder of colored pie charts so you can help find the cause of our rising expenses.
>>> Wally asks Dilbert and Alice, <<<
How much do color copies cost?
>>>  Dilbert looks at the binder and says, <<<
I think I see it!
>>>  Alice says, <<<
It's not the 'magic eye,' Doofus.
>>> 
1996-02-18 * 
Dilbert and the Boss sit at a conference table.  Dilbert works on a laptop connected to an overhead projector.  Dilbert says, <<<
Here's my project time line.
>>> Dilbert points to a diagram and says, <<<
The 'work' portion will take one week.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I'll spend three weeks meeting with people whom you send to me because you don't feel like talking to them yourself.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I'll spend eight weeks getting competitive bids from companies that I know I won't select.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
. . . Six weeks to get the wisdom and approval of executives who are too busy to understand the issues.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
During that time you will randomly reorganize the department and cut my funding.
>>> Dilbert points to a picture of a man jumping out of a building window.  Dilbert continues, <<<
In the final phase I leap to my death, a bitter and broken shell of a man.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Is there some sort of manager thing I should be doing now?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
If I time my leap right you'll just be leaving the building.
>>> 
1996-02-17 * 
Dilbert sits on the couch with his knees bent.  He hands a document to Dogbert and says, <<<
Look at the agreement my company is forcing us to sign.  They claim the rights to any idea an employee ever has.
>>> Dilbert looks at the document and says, <<<
No problem.  Just retype it with a few strategic omissions and sign it.  They can't proofread every one.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Wouldn't that be dishonest?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Maybe you could just show them some of your ideas and they'd grant a waiver.
>>> 
1996-02-16 * 
Dilbert, Wally and Alice read copies of a document.  Dilbert says, <<<
I can't believe they expect us to sign these new employment agreement forms.
>>> Wally says, <<<
According to this, anything we even THINK of becomes the Company's property.  I'm surprised they don't claim our first born sons!
>>> Wally continues, <<<
What do you suppose it means when they copyright our 'DNA and all derivative works?'"  Alice says, <<<
They'd make an exception for you.
>>> 
1996-02-15 * 
The Boss hands Dilbert a document and says, <<<
Here's the revised standard employment agreement.  Sign it or be fired.
>>> Dilbert reads, <<<
This agreement is between the Company (hereafter referred to as 'The Only Company That Would Ever Hire You') and you (hereafter called 'Pudding Head').
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It seems to have a bit of attitude.
>>>  The Boss responds, <<<
Our lawyers turned on us.  I suspect rabies.
>>> 
1996-02-14 * 
The Boss walks down the hall with a new employee.  The Boss says, <<<
As a co-op employee, you can't expect the same lush cubicle environment that the regular employees enjoy.
>>> The Boss brings the man to a cubicle filled with people lying on top of each other.  The Boss says, <<<
You'll be sharing this cubicle with our other co-ops.
>>> Dilbert says to Alice, <<<
I heard that the new co-op only lasted one day.
>>>  Alice quips, <<<
He didn't fit in.

Catbert sits on a monitor and thinks, <<<
I know I should be off tormenting people . . .
>>> Catbert continues thinking, <<<
But I can't pry myself away from this most excellent butt-warming device.
>>> Catbert lies face down on the monitor and thinks, <<<
It's probably because of the hype, but I'm thinking this would be even better with 'Windows 95.'
>>> 
1996-02-12 * 
Catbert stands on the desk and thinks, <<<
The employees have too much time off.  It must be stopped.
>>> Catbert waves his arms and shouts, <<<
I summon the demons of Darkness to assist me!!!
>>> Catbert sits on the monitor while Phil, the demon of Heck, says, <<<
. . . Eliminate sick days.  Make them use vacation days when they're ill.  Call it a 'time bank.'"  Catbert says, <<<
It's playful . . . It's cruel . . . I like it.
>>> 
1996-02-11 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert walk through the park.  Dogbert says, <<<
Simple molecules combine to make powerful chemicals . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Simple cells combine to make powerful lifeforms.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Simple electronics combine to make powerful computers.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Logically, all things are created by a combination of simpler, less capable components.
>>> Dilbert lifts Dogbert onto a rock.  Dogbert continues, <<<
Therefore, a supreme being must be our FUTURE, not our origin!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
What if 'God' is the consciousness that will be created when enough of us are connected by the Internet?!!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That would certainly limit the types of files I download.  I wonder what it would do to response times.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
It's so nice to spend time alone with my thoughts.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
My web browser would FLY!
>>> 
1996-02-10 * 
Dilbert lies on the couch looking worried and Dogbert sits on the backrest.  Dilbert says, <<<
I have too many passwords in my life.  What if I forget them?
>>> Dogbert's ears fly up and he shouts, <<<
You'd lose your job!  You wouldn't be able to withdraw money or check phone messages!  You'd be dead in a week!
>>> Dilbert's hair and tie fly up and he says, <<<
That would have been a good time to be quietly supportive, Dogbert.
>>>  Dogbert responds, <<<
Oh, yeah, that's a lot of fun.
>>> 
1996-02-09 * 
Wally stands in front of the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
Wally, I've decided to move your project due date up a month.
>>> Wally responds angrily, <<<
Every time it looks like I'll reach an objective, you move it!  What does this prove about my performance?
>>> The Boss answers, <<<
It proves I'm better at setting objectives than you are at achieving them.
>>> 
1996-02-08 * 
Dilbert follows the Boss into his office and says, <<<
I told you this project would take a year.  But on my objectives you say I must have it done in three months.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Which of these reasons best describes why: A. You have great confidence in me.  B. You think I padded my estimate.  C. You hate my guts.
>>> The Boss responds, <<<
We don't really need the project.  It's just a way to keep raises low.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I just felt a little dip in my motivation.
>>> 
1996-02-07 * 
Alice asks the Boss, <<<
Why is it that the people with the least need for storage space have the biggest offices?
>>> Alice stands in the door to the Boss's office and says, <<<
I know!  You're using your office as kind of a living monument to inefficiency!
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Is this because I wouldn't let you get a file cabinet?
>>>  Alice asks, <<<
Where would I put it?  My cubicle is full of stacks of proprietary documents.
>>> 
1996-02-06 * 
The Boss stands in the door of Alice's cubicle and says, <<<
Alice, you've got to lock up these proprietary documents you have in your cubicle.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
If our competitors see our plans, it could be very dangerous.
>>>  Alice asks, <<<
For us or for them?
>>> The captions reads, <<<
The Competitors.
>>>  A man reads a document and says, <<<
Ooh!  Look!  They're planning to 'utilize synergy.'  We're in trouble now!
>>>  Another man laughs and a woman says, <<<
Stop!  You're killing me!!
>>> 
1996-02-05 * 
Dogbert, Wally, Dilbert, Alice and the Boss sit at a conference table.  Dogbert says, <<<
I have discovered the cause of your project delays.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Somebody in this room is a piece of deadwood pretending to be a contributor!
>>> Dogbert points his tail at a piece of wood in a dress and shouts, <<<
It is you!
>>>  The deadwood says, <<<
Hey, I made some calls and I'm waiting for information!
>>> 
1996-02-04 * 
Dilbert sits on the couch and Dogbert sits on the backrest.  Dilbert's mother offers him a cookie and says, <<<
I'll never understand what you do for a living.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I told you I'm an engineer, Mom.
>>> Dilbert's mom says, <<<
So you say, but you also say you spend all day in meetings.  When do you do any engineering?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Good point.  Let's just say I'm what the experts call a 'knowledge worker.'
>>> Dilbert's mother asks, <<<
Which experts call it that?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I don't know.
>>> Dilbert's mom asks, <<<
What's the name of the product you're working on?
>>>  Dilbert responds, <<<
I don't know what the acronym stands for . . .
>>> Mom asks, <<<
What kind of market penetration and return on investment do you expect?
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Um . . . I don't know . . .
>>> Dilbert's mom says, <<<
Oh, dear . . . Well, I'm sure you're very punctual.
>>> Dilbert shouts, <<<
Ask me another question!!  C'mon . . .
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Why do they call you a 'KNOWLEDGE worker'?
>>> 
1996-02-03 * 
Dilbert leans out his cubicle door and yells, <<<
Hey, Wally!  The Boss sent his first e-mail message!
>>> Dilbert says to Wally who stands behind him, <<<
And you said he wasn't bright enough to figure out how to use e-mail!
>>>  Wally asks, <<<
What's his message?
>>> Dilbert reads the message, <<<
I forgot my watch.  Does anybody know what time it is?
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Time to change jobs.
>>> 
1996-02-02 * 
The Boss, Alice and Dilbert stand next to the coffee machine.  The Boss says, <<<
I need everybody to help in the shipping department today.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Every product that ships before the end of the month gets counted as revenue for the fiscal year.  Unfortunately, we don't have inventory.
>>> Dilbert, Alice and Wally each have an open box in front of them.  The Boss continues, <<<
So we'll ship whatever is lying around, book it as revenue and sort it out later.
>>>  Wally reaches into his mouth and says, <<<
This one's getting gum.
>>> 
1996-02-01 * 
Dogbert stands on an air traffic control panel.  He says to the Boss, <<<
Thanks to my leadership, the new air traffic control system is designed on time and under budget.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I had to cut a few corners.  This big radar-looking thing is a wall clock.  And most of the buttons are glued on.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It looks like it might be um . . . dangerous.
>>>  Dogbert says angrily, <<<
Great . . . I finish early and what do I get: 'feature creep.'
>>> 
1996-01-31 * 
Wally sits at his desk and thinks, <<<
Wally writes the critical code for our nation's new air traffic control system.  The crowd is silent.
>>> Wally thinks, <<<
Suddenly the gifted programmer employs a rarely seen strategy of 'code reuse.'  The crowd goes wild.
>>> Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit a table eating lunch.  Dilbert asks Wally, <<<
So you used code from the payroll system?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
Here's a tip: don't fly on pay day.
>>> 
1996-01-30 * 
The Boss, Dogbert, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I hired the 'Dogbert Consulting Company' to lead the project because none of you is bright enough.
>>>  Dilbert looks angry. The Boss continues, <<<
And you all have bad attitudes for no apparent reason; that's no way to be a leader.
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Shall we go around the table and introduce ourselves?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I don't get chummy with the locals.
>>> 
1996-01-29 * 
The Boss says to Alice, Dilbert and Wally, <<<
We won the bid to rebuild our nation's air traffic control systems.
>>> Dilbert, Alice and Wally throw their arms up in celebration.  Alice yells, <<<
Yippeee!!!
>>>  Dilbert yells, <<<
Yes!!
>>>  Wally yells, <<<
To the phones!
>>> The Boss walks away thinking, <<<
They don't usually get that excited.
>>>  Inside his cubicle, Wally says into the phone, <<<
Buy a thousand shares of 'Bluehound Bus Lines.'
>>> 
1996-01-28 * 
Dilbert arrives at home carrying a briefcase.  Dogbert sits on the armrest of the chair.  Dilbert says, <<<
I need your help, Dogbert.
>>> Dilbert carries Dogbert to the desk as he explains, <<<
My company is downsizing.  They told us to write our own job requirements then reapply for our jobs.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Why do you want to keep working for such a lame company?
>>>  Dilbert quips, <<<
Loyalty!
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert laugh.  Dogbert says, <<<
Good one.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Okay.  You must write your job requirements so you are the only one on earth who fits.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Right.
>>> Dogbert dictates, <<<
The candidate must have six years experience sitting in a big box being micromanaged by a nitwit.
>>> Dilbert adds, <<<
The candidate must have a festering cynicism and an acquired fear of action.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Good.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That narrows it to ten thousand employees.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
We'll have to focus on your physical abnormalities.
>>> 
1996-01-27 * 
Dilbert says to the Boss, <<<
. . . But our primary vendor can't deliver, so . . .
>>>  The Boss ignores Dilbert and thinks, <<<
I wonder what's on tv tonight.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
. . . Should we risk a lawsuit or build a product that nobody on earth wants?
>>>  The Boss thinks, <<<
Did he ask me to make a choice?
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Will it be a request for information or an impractical solution?
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Let's do both!
>>> 
1996-01-26 * 
Dogbert stands on a conference table next to a laptop and an overhead projector.  He says to the Boss, Alice and Wally, <<<
I've reduced your service costs by giving the technical-support group an unlisted phone number.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
And a flaw in your product disables the customer's e-mail; they can't even write to you for help!
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
What if they ask a friend to e-mail us?
>>>  Alice responds, <<<
People who use our product don't have friends.
>>>  Wally asks, <<<
Really?  I use it.
>>> 
1996-01-25 * 
The Boss, Dogbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss points at Dogbert who is growling and says, <<<
I've asked Dogbert to get rid of our most troublesome customers.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Ten percent of your customers account for ninety percent of your service costs.  They must be eliminated.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
Is that the same group of customers who actually USE our product?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Plus the ones who were injured unpacking it.
>>> 
1996-01-24 * 
Alice and Dilbert stand behind a little boy who sits at a desk.  Dilbert says, <<<
Matt, your job is to test my new invention that blocks kids from seeing dirty pictures on the Internet.
>>> As Matt uses the Internet, Dilbert tells Alice, <<<
His youthful curiosity is no match for my technical brilliance.
>>> Matt stops typing and stares at the screen.  Dilbert says to Alice, <<<
I hope that wasn't the sound of eyeballs getting really big.
>>> 
1996-01-23 * 
Dilbert sits at his computer and Dogbert looks over his shoulder.  Dilbert says, <<<
I'm inventing a new technology to prevent kids from seeing smut on the Internet.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
So you're pitting your intelligence against the collective sex drive of all the teenagers who own computers?
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What is your point?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Did you know that if you put a little hat on a snowball it can last a long time in hell?
>>> 
1996-01-22 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
The company announced a new compensation plan today.  Bonuses will be paid only to the top ten percent of the employees.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
In related news, 89&#037; of the employees resigned in bitter disgust.  The top ten percent also left, realizing they could get better jobs elsewhere.
>>> The Boss concludes, <<<
This could have an impact on those of you who remain.
>>>  Wally asks, <<<
We get the bonuses?
>>> 
1996-01-21 * 
Catbert stands at his desk.  He says, <<<
Hee hee!  This is my most diabolical work yet as director of human resources.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
Thanks to e-mail I can play with hundreds of employees at once!
>>> Dilbert sits at his desk thinking, <<<
Uh-oh . . . A message from the evil Mister Catbert.
>>> The message says, <<<
In order to reduce our janitorial expenses . . .
>>>  Alice thinks, <<<
That's a phrase you don't want to see.
>>> Wally reads, <<<
Every engineer will be required to strap a broom to his or her . . .
>>> Wally walks down the hall with a broom attached to his back. Wally and Dilbert stand outside a conference room.  Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
On the positive side, marketing invites us to a lot more meetings now.
>>>  A man inside the room says, <<<
Five minutes; we're still eating cookies.
>>> 
1996-01-20 * 
Dogbert says to Bob the Dinosaur, <<<
I heard you were doing some baby-sitting, Bob.
>>>  Bob responds, <<<
Yeah!  I did the Morton triplets last night.
>>> Bob says, <<<
It's not easy to juggle three screaming toddlers.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
When you say 'juggle' . . .
>>>  Dilbert hands Bob the phone and says, <<<
It's the Mortons with a question about their ceiling fan.
>>> 
1996-01-19 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert are taking a walk outside.  Dogbert says, <<<
Thanks to my software empire, my net worth is twenty billion dollars.
>>> Dogbert sits on a log and says, <<<
Contrary to popular opinion, it does seem to make me happy.
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
Money can't buy a sunset, Dogbert.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
No, but I was able to license the digital rights.
>>> 
1996-01-18 * 
The caption says, <<<
Dogbert meets with software developers.
>>>  Dogbert sits at a table with a laptop that is hooked up to an overhead projector.  Dogbert says, <<<
Note the huge market for software that runs on the 'Dogbert 2000' operating system.
>>> Dogbert reaches into a bag and says, <<<
But who cares?  The important thing is that I brought a bag of toys.
>>> As the software developers play with the toys, Dogbert thinks, <<<
Some say the computer industry is built on silicon.  I think foam and plastic are equally important.
>>> 
1996-01-17 * 
Dogbert sits at a table with a client and says, <<<
If you plan to remain in the computer business you'd better bundle the 'Dogbert 2000' operating system with every unit you sell.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Otherwise, after I dominate the market you'll be last on my list to receive new products!
>>> The man says, <<<
You remind me of somebody . . .
>>>  Dogbert responds, <<<
It's the glasses, isn't it?
>>> 
1996-01-16 * 
Dilbert sits on the couch and Dogbert stands on the armrest.  Dogbert says, <<<
After I become a billionaire from my software company I'll do a little dance.
>>> Dogbert dances on the armrest and sings, <<<
I'm so rich / It's me you hail / If I'm obnoxious / Kiss my tail.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Do you plan to do any charity work?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Let me put it this way - you just saw my contribution to the fine arts.
>>> 
1996-01-15 * 
Dilbert stands on a book on a chair and works at a computer.  He tells Dilbert, <<<
I call my new operating system the 'Dogbert 2000.'
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Soon I will dominate the entire PC industry!  Heh-heh . . .
>>>  Dilbert looks at the monitor and says, <<<
It looks like 'Windows 95.'
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I use some of the same graphic metaphors, but I pronounce them differently.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
How do you pronounce the 'Microsoft' logo?
>>> 
1996-01-14 * 
Wally follows the Boss and says, <<<
We need to have a little talk . . .
>>> Wally continues, <<<
You told me to finish my project in a week but it's taken two months.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
This doesn't look good for your ability to estimate resource requirements.
>>> The Boss sits at his desk.  Wally continues, <<<
Frankly, it's not much of an endorsement of your leadership either.  I was uninspired the whole time.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
And don't even get me started about your incompetence at budgeting.  I spent WAY more than you predicted!
>>> Wally pretends to strangle himself as he says, <<<
Your incessant demands for status reports were like a rope that strangled my productivity!
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Bottom line, your performance did NOT meet my expectations.
>>> Wally's clothes are disheveled and his glasses are bent,  Dilbert says, <<<
So, Wally, do you still think the best defense is a good offense?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
It seemed like such a good idea.
>>> 
1996-01-13 * 
Wally presses a button on his keyboard and thinks, <<<
Gotta hurry.  One . . . two . . . three . . .
>>> Wally runs out of his cubicle and thinks, <<<
I have twelve seconds to get to the shared laser printed.
>>> As Wally peers around the corner, Alice and Dilbert stand at the printer reading copies of Wally's resume.  Alice says, <<<
Guess who saved the Apollo 13 space mission.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Did you know that Wally invented the cursor?
>>> 
1996-01-12 * 
Carl peers into Dilbert's cubicle and says, <<<
It's time for a visit from 'Camping Carl.'
>>> Dilbert sits at his desk and thinks, <<<
There goes my entire morning.
>>>  Carl says, <<<
I'd like to begin with a monologue entitled 'Woe is Carl.'
>>> Inside the cubicle, Carl continues, <<<
I'm working every minute!
>>>  Dilbert's head comes out of a trap door in the floor outside his cubicle.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
They all laughed when I built the escape tunnel.
>>> 
1996-01-11 * 
Dilbert and Liz sit at a table in a restaurant.  Dilbert says, <<<
I would never buy something over the internet.  I'd hate to have my credit card number floating around out there.
>>> Dilbert hands his credit card to the waitress as he says, <<<
There are a lot of unscrupulous people on the net.
>>> The caption says, <<<
Later.
>>>  Dilbert concludes, <<<
. . . Bottom line, it just isn't common sense.
>>>  The waitress returns wearing a fur coat and hands Dilbert's credit card back to him. 
1996-01-10 * 
Dilbert and Wally stand against the wall on either side of the door to Ted's office.  Dilbert says, <<<
Alice is ready to drive a stake through the heart of our demon-possessed boss.
>>> Wally and Dilbert hide in the hallway.  From inside the office, they hear, <<<
Whack, whack, whack!
>>> Ted and Alice walk out the office door.  Ted has many pens stuck in his chest.  He says, <<<
It's times like these when I'm glad my heart is the size of a raisin!
>>>  Alice says to Wally, <<<
I need all of your pens, including 'Blue Betty.'"  Wally's mouth hangs open in shock. 
1996-01-09 * 
Dilbert and Alice approach Dogbert who is sitting on a desk.  Dilbert says, <<<
My new boss is possessed by an evil force.  We need your advice, Dogbert.
>>> Dogbert responds, <<<
There is only one solution.  You must drive a stake through his heart.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
There's no way we could be so cruel!!
>>>  Alice holds up a pen and says, <<<
Can I borrow your pen?  All I have is this wimpy retractable.
>>> 
1996-01-08 * 
The caption says, <<<
Performance Review.
>>>  Alice sits across from Ted's desk.  Ted reads a document and says, <<<
Your engineering work was excellent, Alice.  But there was the little incident where you . . .
>>> Ted stands, revealing a devil's tail, and screams, <<<
Shoved me down a flight of stairs and killed me, thus inviting the forces of darkness to possess my body!!!
>>>  Alice holds up a crucifix and yells, <<<
Back!
>>> Dilbert sees Alice walking out of Ted's office and asks, <<<
How'd it go?

I swear, this job is all politics.

Dilbert sits at his desk thinking, <<<
Why do I have a feeling of impending doom?
>>>  The Boss peeks into Dilbert's cubicle. The Boss says, <<<
Good news!
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You won't have to spend another lonely day in this tiny cubicle.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
I'm getting an office?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Better!  You're getting a roommate!
>>> Dilbert shouts, <<<
Why???  We've got plenty of empty cubicles!  Our company owns the whole building!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The finance department charges my budget for the square footage we use.
>>> Dilbert looks over the cubicle wall and says to the Boss, <<<
It's a false savings!  You're hurting the company!
>>>  The Boss walks away thinking, <<<
All I hear is a faint buzzing.
>>> Dilbert sits at his desk thinking, <<<
Oh, well.  How bad could it be?
>>>  A man wearing a cowboy hat and carrying a can of beans and a radio says, <<<
I hope you like baked beans and square-dancing as much as I do!
>>> 
1996-01-06 * 
The Boss pokes his head into Ted's office and asks, <<<
How do you like being a manager, Ted?
>>> Ted replies, <<<
Yesterday my staff pushed me down ten flights of stairs.  My soul left my body and now I'm a lifeless evil entity.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Just in time to do performance reviews!
>>>  Ted responds, <<<
I couldn't have planned it better.
>>> 
1996-01-05 * 
Ted, Alice and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  Ted says, <<<
As your new boss I have yet to select my 'pet' employee.  I shall do this by closing my eyes and pointing the beard on my forehead.
>>> Ted sits facing away from the table with his eyes closed.  He says, <<<
To make it fair, I'll close my eyes while one of you spins my chair!
>>> As Alice pushes Ted's chair into the stairwell Dilbert whispers, <<<
Alice . . . Um . . . Technically this isn't 'spinning.'
>>> 
1996-01-04 * 
The Boss gestures toward Ted and says to Alice and Dilbert, <<<
I promoted Ted to be your new manager.  I used to think he looked boyish, but his new beard has changed that.
>>>  Alice and Dilbert look shocked. Alice asks, <<<
Are either of you the least bit concerned that Ted's beard is growing from his forehead?
>>> As they walk away, Ted says to the Boss, <<<
She made it sound as if it's wrong.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
You can punish them for having bad opinions.
>>> 
1996-01-03 * 
Dilbert, Wally and Ted are drinking coffee.  Ted says, <<<
I've decided to mask my boyish looks by growing a beard.
>>> As he and Dilbert walk away, Wally says, <<<
I didn't think Ted was smart enough to know how to grow a beard.
>>>  Dilbert laughs. The caption says, <<<
Two weeks later.
>>>  Ted points to a beard growing on his forehead and says to the Boss, <<<
How do you like my beard?
>>>  The Boss thinks, <<<
My search for a new manager is over.
>>> 
1996-01-02 * 
Dilbert sits at his computer and Antina appears in the door of his cubicle.  Antina is muscular, has short hair and is wearing a tie and a skirt.  She says, <<<
Hi, I'm Antina the Non-stereotypical Woman.
>>> Antina observes, <<<
That computer monitor you're using is supposed to be 17 inches, but it's more like 16.5 inches.
>>> She continues, <<<
I took the coffee machine apart just for fun - want to see?
>>> 
1996-01-01 * 
Dogbert sits at a table with Tina who is growling.  Dogbert says, <<<
A while back I asked for opinions about this new character, 'Tina the Brittle Tech Writer.'
>>> Dogbert presents the results, <<<
Most people, including nearly all the self-described feminists, said keep her.  But there were many requests to add 'non-stereotypical' female characters for balance.
>>> Dogbert points at a muscular woman with a shaved head and says, <<<
In the interest of balance I give you 'Antina.'"  Antina says, <<<
Is anybody up for some math?
>>> 
1995-12-31 * 
Dilbert and Wally sit at a table.  The Boss enters the room and says, <<<
I've got an idea!
>>>  Dilbert and Wally think, <<<
We're doomed.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Why can't we run our inventory database over our e-mail system?
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Fact: that is the stupidest idea in the universe.
>>> Wally thinks, <<<
Fact: his comprehension is so limited that debate is futile.
>>> Dilbert and Wally both think, <<<
Fact: we could spend hours unsuccessfully explaining why it's a stupid idea.
>>> Dilbert and Wally think, <<<
Fact: he would never know if we used his idea or not.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
No problem.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
We'll get right on it.
>>>  The Boss walks away thinking, <<<
My work is done.
>>> Wally tells Dilbert, <<<
Stupidity is like nuclear power; it can be used for good or evil.
>>>  Dilbert adds, <<<
And you don't want to get any on you.
>>> 
1995-12-30 * 
The caption says, <<<
Correction.
>>>  Dogbert sits behind a desk saying, <<<
A recent Dilbert strip used the words 'ant farm' to describe a habitat for ants.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Lawyers have informed me that 'ant farm' is a trademark of 'Uncle Milton Industries, Inc.'  They demand a public clarification.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What SHOULD we call a habitat for worthless and disgusting little creatures?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Law school.

Dilbert sits at his computer.  A message on the screen says, <<<
Your new software is successfully installed.  Do you want to send your registration info by modem?

Yes.

The software has found your credit card number and is placing orders for new products it thinks you need . . . Please wait.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Uh.
>>> The message says, <<<
Making room on your hard drive . . .

Either way . .

Dogbert stands on the desk and says, <<<
I declare myself 'King Dogbert,' the first ruler of the Internet!!

Are you aware that the Internet is comprised of millions of individuals and organizations that operate independently?

Until now!

Dilbert stands in the doorway of his cubicle and says, <<<
Okay!  This is one tidy little cubicle now!
>>>  The trash can outside the cubicle is full. Dilbert polishes his name plate and says, <<<
The cleanliness of one's work space is a sign of how much one enjoys one's job.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Give me the cleaner; it's my turn to fantasize that I'm a maid.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Five more minutes . . . Please.
>>> 
1995-12-26 * 
The Boss, Wally, Dilbert and Alice sit at a conference table.  Wally says, <<<
This is a living document.
>>> The Boss screams and drops the document. Alice says, <<<
Next time, just say you plan to update it.
>>>  Dilbert shakes the paper and says, <<<
Mine's dead.
>>> 
1995-12-25 * 
Wally sits at his desk and tells Dilbert, <<<
I got one of those '900' phone numbers.  I make money every time somebody calls for my valuable advice.
>>> Wally's telephone rings several times. Dilbert asks, <<<
Do you ever answer it?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
Voice mail . . . Get with the nineties.
>>> 
1995-12-24 * 
Dilbert hands his plane ticket to a woman at the Happy Airlines counter. Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
Vacation, here we come!
>>>  The woman types on the computer. Dilbert watches her type and thinks, <<<
Why do they have to enter so much stuff in the computer?
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
They already have our reservation and seat assignment in there.  What else do they need?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm developing a sudden fear of flying.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Step aside.
>>> Dogbert stands on the counter and shouts, <<<
What's going on up here??!!
>>> The woman says, <<<
Gate 13.  Have a nice flight.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Okay.
>>> The woman types, <<<
They never saw their beloved luggage again.  The misfits always regretted offending Tantra, the Goddess of Flight.  The end.
>>> 
1995-12-23 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Dogbert sit at a conference table.  Dilbert says, <<<
On the advice of my dog, I'm asking for an additional ten million dollars for my project.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
That will make a more spectacular failure, thus guaranteeing a promotion for me.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
As your boss, I'd get recognition too . . . Okay.
>>> Wally asks Dogbert, <<<
Wow!  Do you have any advice for me?!
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Breath mints.
>>> 
1995-12-22 * 
Dilbert sits on the couch and Dogbert sits on the armrest.  Dogbert says, <<<
Most business plans fail.  Obviously, success is not a realistic goal.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
But the people who manage the most spectacular failures get promoted first because of their experience.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That is the most cynical thing I've ever heard in my life!
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Thanks.  I'm blushing.
>>> 
1995-12-21 * 
Dogbert stands at Dilbert's desk working on the computer and Dilbert sits next to him.  Dilbert says, <<<
It isn't ethical to hack into the payroll computer and give me a raise, Dogbert.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Not ethical??  Is it ethical for them to make you work seventy hours a week and only pay you for forty??!!
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How about a five percent raise?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Well, there is the issue of the quality of your work . . .
>>> 
1995-12-20 * 
Dogbert stands at Dilbert's desk and Dilbert sits next to him.  Alice asks, <<<
Hey, what's Dogbert doing here?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
This is 'Bring Your Dog to Work Day.'"  Alice says, <<<
There's no such thing.
>>> Dogbert works at the desk and says, <<<
I'm through the security firewall and into the personnel records.
>>>  Dilbert looks angry and says, <<<
We need to talk.
>>> 
1995-12-19 * 
Dilbert and his mother sit on the couch.  Dilbert shows his mother a document and says, <<<
My company asked all employees to act as salespeople to friends and family.  I think you could use this, Mom.
>>> Dilbert's mother says, <<<
Why would I need a primary rate circuit?  I've already got a frame relay drop to my web server in the sewing room.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
This is going to be a tough sale.
>>>  Dilbert's mother says, <<<
Hello-o-o!  Earth to Dilbert!  This is packet data . . .
>>> 
1995-12-18 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Our new slogan is 'Everybody is in sales.'
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Imagine if all our employees convinced their friends to buy our product, eventually . . .
>>> Alice asks, <<<
We'd have no friends?
>>>  Wally asks Dilbert, <<<
What's this 'friend' thing I keep hearing about?
>>> 
1995-12-17 * 
The Boss, Alice, Wally and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Alice, our records show that you haven't taken a vacation all year.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Company policy requires you to use your vacation days.
>>> Alice says, <<<
How??  You told me to work seven days a week to prepare the project for your boss's year-end review.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
Do you want me to meet the artificial project target or the artificial vacation target?
>>> Alice stands up and screams, <<<
Hello!!!  These are mutually exclusive goals!!!  Hello!!!
>>> Alice says, <<<
Ooh . . . Sorry, I usually just think that last part in silent frustration.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Moving right along . . . Kudos to Wally for using all of his vacation days ahead of schedule.
>>> Alice looks furious.  Wally says, <<<
Get over it, Alice.  We can't all be superstars.
>>> 
1995-12-16 * 
Dogbert sits on the couch backrest and Ratbert stands on the armrest.  Dogbert says, <<<
When I conquer the world I'll have a secret handshake to identify the people who will be part of my new ruling class.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Cross your eyes and stick out your tongue.  Good, now vigorously slap your face.
>>> As Ratbert slaps himself, Dogbert says, <<<
The people who aren't doing that will be identified as my new ruling class.
>>> 
1995-12-15 * 
Wally tells Dilbert, <<<
I read somewhere that certain religions require their initiates to perform pointless never-ending tasks to rid them of their egos.
>>> Wally and Dilbert look at each other. Wally and Dilbert bow in front of the Boss's desk.  The Boss thinks, <<<
What now?
>>> 
1995-12-14 * 
Dilbert stands behind a woman who is sitting at a desk.  She says, <<<
Wait-a-minute . . . I'm starting to realize something.
>>> The woman continues, <<<
My job title is senior associate, yet I spend my time doing clerical work . . . And unless I'm mistaken, I'm the lowest paid employee.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Is this a bad time?
>>>  The woman ignores him and screams, <<<
Aaagh!! I'm a secretary!
>>> 
1995-12-13 * 
Dilbert reaches for a modem in a computer store.  A man says, <<<
No, you fool.  That modem will never fit your need.
>>> Dilbert reads the box and thinks, <<<
The specs look okay.
>>>  The man yells, <<<
You're an idiot compared to me!  Put that down!  It's the wrong interface!  The WRONG interface!!!
>>> As Dilbert hands the modem to a salesclerk at the cash register, the man clutches Dilbert's shirt and growls.  Dilbert asks the clerk, <<<
Is he on commission?
>>>  She answers, <<<
Yeah, he pays us a dollar a customer.
>>> 
1995-12-12 * 
The Boss, Wally and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
It's status report time where each of you gets to prove what poor communicators you are while I act interested!
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Remember to use lots of acronyms that only you understand.  And speak in a whiny monotone that makes us all want to slap you!
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm starting to lose my idealism.
>>> 
1995-12-11 * 
The Boss hands his secretary a document and says, <<<
Send this by e-mail.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Fax it, too, in case he doesn't check his e-mail.  And mail the original so he has a clean copy.
>>> As the Boss walks away, the secretary says, <<<
Goodbye 'paperless,' hello 'clueless.'
>>> 
1995-12-10 * 
A bald man says into the telephone, <<<
Hello, is this the 'Help Desk'?
>>> Dogbert wears a headset and sits at a computer.  He replies, <<<
No, that group got reengineered out of existence.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I'm the new 'No Help Whatsoever Desk.'  My job is to make sure you never call again.
>>> The man asks, <<<
Can you tell me how to make a pie chart?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Crush your computer into small chunks, add flour and bake one hour.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
While you're waiting, read the free novel we sent you.  It's a Spanish story about a guy named 'Manual.'
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Repeat the process until you get the desired result.
>>> The man sits next to an oven reading an instruction manual.  He thinks, <<<
This lost a LOT in the translation.
>>> 
1995-12-09 * 
The Boss and Dogbert sit at a conference table.  Dogbert says, <<<
It's inexplicable, but the low-cost system I sold you seems to be woefully under-powered.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
You could replace it with another vendor's system, thus showing everybody you make a mistake.  Or you can pay my outrageous upgrade fees.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
How big a fool do you think I am?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I won't know until I see if you go for the lease option.
>>> 
1995-12-08 * 
Dogbert stands on a desk and says to Wally, <<<
It's funny - before your company bought that critical system from me, YOU had all the power . . .
>>> Dogbert yells, <<<
But now, only I can provide essential upgrades!!  I call the shots, you simple fool!!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Send in the next employee.
>>>  Outside the cubicle Dilbert and another employee are standing in line holding numbers.  The man says, <<<
At least we don't have any multi-vendor compatibility issues.
>>> 
1995-12-07 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk and says, <<<
So, you ignored my recommendation and bought a low-cost system that's totally inadequate . . .
>>> Dilbert holds up a document and continues, <<<
You compensated for this blunder by making it part of MY objectives to make the system work . . .
>>> Dilbert concludes, <<<
You'll get a bonus for saving money.  I'll get fired, thus saving more money and earning you ANOTHER bonus.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
I'm on a roll.
>>> 
1995-12-06 * 
Dogbert and the Boss sit at a conference table.  Dogbert says, <<<
Your employees have recommended a vendor who has an attractive salesperson.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
But the 'Dogbert Technology Company' can provide you with a hardware solution for HALF the cost!
>>>  The Boss says excitedly, <<<
I'll save money!
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
What if I need to upgrade later?  Is it expensive?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I must have left that price sheet in my other fur.
>>> 
1995-12-05 * 
Alice stands behind Wally's desk and says, <<<
I can't believe you're recommending this lousy vendor just because the sales rep is gorgeous.
>>> Wally hands Alice a photograph and says, <<<
Here's a picture of Thor, their field engineer.
>>> Alice stares at the picture and asks, <<<
Does he really work without a shirt?
>>>  Wally answers, <<<
Only if you but the 'Indian Chief' maintenance package.
>>> 
1995-12-04 * 
Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table with a sales rep.  As they look through some folders, the woman says, <<<
On one hand, my company does use inferior technology in our products . . .
>>> The salesperson continues, <<<
But on the other hand, I'm the most attractive female who has paid attention to you this year.
>>> Dilbert responds angrily, <<<
What kind of engineers do you think we are??!
>>>  Wally asks, <<<
Do you have pictures of your field support people?
>>> 
1995-12-03 * 
Alice sits at her desk.  The janitor stands in her cubicle door and says, <<<
Working late again, huh, Alice?
>>> Alice says, <<<
Seventy hours this week . . .
>>> The janitor replies, <<<
Me too.  Thank goodness for overtime pay!
>>> Alice looks shocked and asks, <<<
Overtime pay?
>>>  The janitor says, <<<
Allow me to explain.
>>> The janitor draws a graph and says, <<<
Unlike you so-called 'exempt' employees, my income increases if I work additional hours.
>>> The janitor continues, <<<
I'm pulling in seventy-five thousand a year.  And half the time I just hide in the basement reading 'Fishing' magazine.
>>> The janitor continues, <<<
The only down side is that I don't get to enjoy the intellectual stimulation of my co-workers the way you do.
>>> The janitor sits in the basement reading a magazine.  He thinks, <<<
I don't know what I like better - deep sea fishing or cubicle fishing.
>>> 
1995-12-02 * 
Dilbert sits on his couch watching television.  A voice on the tv says, <<<
Does your boss give you orders and later deny it?  Do you get in trouble for doing what you're told?
>>> On the tv, Dogbert sits at a desk while Ratbert holds a video camera.  Dogbert says, <<<
The 'Dogbert Detective Agency' will videotape it all and embarrass your boss with proof!
>>> Back in the office, the Boss reads a document and says, <<<
What??!  Why did you do this??!
>>>  Dilbert stands in front his desk holding a videotape and says, <<<
This is the happiest moment of my career.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Lights!
>>> 
1995-12-01 * 
The Boss speaks to three employees in tech support.  He says, <<<
We just shipped our newest product.  You folks in tech support will need to be trained so you can avoid any embarrassments.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We had a monk write the training material on a grain of rice.  We could only afford one, so you'll have to share it.
>>>  The Boss tosses a grain of rice at them and they lunge for it. As the employees fall to the floor fighting, the Boss says, <<<
To be honest, I'm not sure we had a real monk.  He wrote everything in Pig Latin.
>>> 
1995-11-30 * 
Dilbert and Liz sit on the floor leaning against the couch.  Dilbert says, <<<
We've been dating for a year now, Liz.  There's something I'd like to do tonight . . .
>>> Dilbert and Liz hold hands as Dilbert continues, <<<
There are some needs that I can't fulfill at work.
>>>  Liz says, <<<
I understand.
>>> Dilbert sits at the desk and shouts, <<<
Yes!  Yes!
>>>  Liz sits behind him reading a book.  She asks, <<<
How long has your Internet connection at work been broken?
>>> 
1995-11-29 * 
Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a table eating lunch.  Wally asks, <<<
Alice, did you hear that Dilbert's network connection isn't working?
>>>  Alice says, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
He is what we call a technology 'have not.'  His competitiveness in the global economy will last as long as this french fry.
>>>  Alice says, <<<
So sad.
>>> As Wally gulps the french fry, Alice says to Dilbert, <<<
After lunch, I'm going to use something called 'electronic mail.'  You can watch if you promise not to touch anything.
>>>  Dilbert looks angry. 
1995-11-28 * 
Dilbert sits across from Catbert's desk.  Dilbert asks, <<<
Does Human Resources offer any treatment programs for people with dysfunctional internet connections?
>>> Catbert shows Dilbert a pamphlet and says, <<<
I recommend the 'yarn therapy.'  You'll be wrapped in a huge ball of yarn and used as furniture in my office.
>>> Dilbert reads the brochure and asks, <<<
Is this like the famous 'Ropes' course where I learn to solve problems as part of a team?
>>>  Catbert replies, <<<
Exactly, except here you learn to be my couch.
>>> 
1995-11-27 * 
Dilbert peers into a co-worker's cubicle and says, <<<
My password for the network isn't working.
>>>  The man says, <<<
Fill out a help request online.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I can't get online because my password doesn't work . . .
>>>  The man says, <<<
Send me an e-mail message about it.
>>> Dilbert shouts angrily, <<<
I can't send e-mail because I can't get on the stinkin' network!!!
>>>  The man says, <<<
Geez, you're worthless . . .
>>> 
1995-11-26 * 
Dilbert stands at the security desk.  The guard hands a vendor a visitor's badge and says, <<<
Badge.
>>>  The man thinks, <<<
The clever salesman evaluates his prey.
>>> Dilbert pushes the elevator button.  The man thinks, <<<
I hope he's an important decision-maker.
>>> Dilbert tells the salesperson, <<<
Take any seat.  I call the good chair.
>>>  The man thinks, <<<
Warning!  Cubicle!  Low-ranking employee!
>>> Dilbert draws a diagram and says, <<<
Here's our organization chart: president . . . senior vice president . . . vice president . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Okay, lift your foot.  Do you see that coffee stain on the carpet?
>>>  The vendor asks, <<<
That's you?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
No, that's my boss.  I would be under the carpet.
>>> The salesman asks, <<<
Do I have any hope of talking to somebody who can make a decision?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Let me check.
>>> Dilbert peers over the wall into Wally's cubicle and says, <<<
Hey, Wally, what's a 'decision'?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
It sounds like something our competitors do.
>>>  The salesman covers his eyes and sobs. 
1995-11-25 * 
The Boss says to his secretary, <<<
I've gotta run to the post office.
>>> The secretary says, <<<
You go to the post office every day.  Are you aware that you can buy more than one stamp at a time?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Apparently you don't understand the concept of 'float.'
>>> 
1995-11-24 * 
Dilbert, Alice and Wally sit at a table eating lunch.  Wally says, <<<
I don't understand why some people wash their bath towels.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
When I get out of the shower I'm the cleanest object in my house.  In theory, those towels should be getting cleaner every time they touch me.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Maybe I could hug you every day so I don't need to take showers.
>>>  Wally asks, <<<
Are towels supposed to bend?
>>> 
1995-11-23 * 
The Boss, Wally, Dilbert and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
The company has decided to outsource all of the functions that we're not any good at.
>>> Dilbert, Wally and Alice throw their arms up in excitement and shout, <<<
Yippee!  Yay!
>>> Wally asks the Boss, <<<
When's your last day?
>>>  Alice points at him and says, <<<
Uh-oh . . . They're not good at knowing what they're not good at . . .
>>> 
1995-11-22 * 
Dilbert watches as Wally sits in his chair and bends over to reach his keyboard on the floor.  Wally says, <<<
This new policy of keeping our keyboards on the floor is ridiculous!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The only possible explanation is to make us all stooped over so it's easier for management to kick our behinds!  Ha ha ha!
>>>  Wally laughs. As the Boss peeks into Wally's cubicle, Dilbert looks shocked and says, <<<
Wait a minute . . . That IS the only explanation.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Cover me; I'm going to the printer.
>>> 
1995-11-21 * 
Dilbert stands on a desk next to Ratbert, who is bending over.  Dogbert points to Ratbert and says, <<<
My consulting partner, Ratbert, will demonstrate how to inform employees that their jobs will be outsourced.
>>> As he kicks Ratbert off the desk and into a trash can, Dogbert says, <<<
You're history.  Scram.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
How do I get them all stooped over?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I recommend a program of very bad ergonomics.
>>> 
1995-11-20 * 
The Boss sits across from Dogbert's desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
I recommend that you reorganize to strengthen the core competency of your company.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
As luck would have it, your core competency is 'giving money to consultants.'
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I don't think that's the ONLY thing we're good at.
>>>  Dogbert responds, <<<
It depends on if you count 'whining.'
>>> 
1995-11-19 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert and Wally, <<<
We need to ship the V-1 product tomorrow.  I promised our CEO he can announce it at the shareholder meeting.
>>> Wally says, <<<
That's two months early!!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
We haven't added any features yet!!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What would we ship?  Our lab prototype is the only V-1 in existence!
>>>  Wally cries, <<<
No . . . You wouldn't!
>>> The Boss picks up the device and says, <<<
I've scheduled press tours so you can do demos all next week.
>>>  Wally asks, <<<
On what?!
>>> As the Boss walks away carrying the prototype, Dilbert says, <<<
We'll need twenty thousand dollars to build another prototype!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
That reminds me; I froze the budget for the rest of the year.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
If there's anything you'd like me to do, don't hesitate to ask.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Yeah, I'd like you to do something . . .
>>> The Boss looks angry.  Wally says, <<<
Ooh . . . I think I should have hesitated to ask that.
>>> 
1995-11-18 * 
The Boss stands behind Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
From now on I'm going to be more proactive.
>>> The Boss screams, <<<
You're fired!!
>>>  Dilbert's tie and hair fly up in shock. Dilbert turns around and asks, <<<
For what??
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
I don't know yet.  That's the problem with being proactive.
>>> 
1995-11-17 * 
The Boss stands behind Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
I think we should build an SQL database.
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Does he understand what he said or is it something he saw in a trade magazine ad?
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What color do you want that database?
>>>  The Boss answers, <<<
I think mauve has the most RAM.
>>> 
1995-11-16 * 
Alice sits at a conference table typing on a laptop.  An older man with a beard sits next to her.  The man says, <<<
I used to write programs using punch cards . . . But I'd rather be fishing . . .
>>> Alice grabs the man by his suspenders and shouts, <<<
Look, you bearded road apple, if you answer one more of my questions with an irrelevant story I'll snap you into next week!!
>>> The caption says, <<<
Sometime next week . . .
>>>  Dilbert and Wally see a hole in the air with a man's legs hanging out of it.  Wally says, <<<
Looks like a hole in the space-time continuum.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Did you hear a snap?
>>> 
1995-11-15 * 
Dilbert, Wally and the Boss sit at a conference table.  Wally says, <<<
My accomplishment this week is that I've become an agent of change.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
I foster and reward those behaviors that contribute to a culture of teamwork.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I've become slightly more cynical.
>>>  Wally pats Dilbert on the shoulder and says, <<<
Keep up the good work, buddy.
>>> 
1995-11-14 * 
Dilbert sits at his computer and says to Ratbert, <<<
The company pays me ten dollars for every bug I fix in my code, Ratbert.
>>> Dilbert pushes his keyboard toward Ratbert and says, <<<
I want you to do your little rat dance on my keyboard so I'll have lots of bugs to fix.
>>> Ratbert asks as he dances on the keyboard, <<<
How am I doing?
>>>  Dilbert looks at the screen and says, <<<
Not so good.  You just authored a web browser.
>>> 
1995-11-13 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Our goal is to write bug-free software.  I'll pay a ten-dollar bonus for every bug you find and fix.
>>> Dilbert, Wally and Alice throw their arms up in excitement.  Dilbert yells, <<<
Yahoo!
>>>  Alice yells, <<<
We're rich!
>>>  Wally yells, <<<
Yes!!!  Yes!!!  Yes!!!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I hope this drives the right behavior.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I'm gonna write me a new minivan this afternoon!
>>> 
1995-11-12 * 
The Boss, Catbert, Dilbert, Alice and Wally sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Mister Catbert will explain our new 'total compensation plan' for excellence.
>>> Catbert says, <<<
We no longer view compensation in the narrow terms of salary alone.
>>> Dilbert, Alice and Wally think, <<<
Danger!  Danger!
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
If employee benefits go up, then salaries can go down and it all balances out.
>>> Catbert lies on the table and says, <<<
For example, did you know you could lower your blood pressure by rubbing my soft, furry belly?
>>> Alice says, <<<
It might be a trick!
>>>  Wally thinks, <<<
What's the worst thing that could happen?
>>> Wally rubs Catbert's stomach and Catbert shouts, <<<
Ha ha ha!!!  It's a health benefit!  Now I'll cut everybody's salary!
>>> Dilbert, Alice and Wally look shocked and their hair and clothing is disheveled.  Dilbert says, <<<
I've noticed that the more health benefits I get, the worse I feel.
>>> 
1995-11-11 * 
Dilbert stands beside an overhead projector.  He says, <<<
This next transparency is an incomprehensible jumble of complexity and undefined acronyms.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
You might wonder why I'm going to show it to you since the only possible result is to lower your opinion of my communication skills.
>>> Dilbert points at the diagrams and says, <<<
Frankly, it's because I like making complex pictures more than I like you.
>>> 
1995-11-10 * 
The Boss and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss asks, <<<
How long will it take to fix any problems we find in our beta product?
>>> Dilbert answers, <<<
It is logically impossible to schedule for the unknown.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Try to think as a manager, not as an engineer.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
In that case, we'll fix the problems before we find them.
>>> 
1995-11-09 * 
The caption says, <<<
Saint Dogbert enters the Land of Cubicles searching for the demons of stupidity.
>>>  Dogbert walks down the hall wearing a bishop's miter and holding a scepter. The caption says, <<<
Suddenly he finds an over-promoted computer guru spouting useless database concepts.
>>>  A man sits at a conference table with two glassy-eyed co-workers.  The man says, <<<
You'd be fools to ignore the boolean anti-binary least-square approach.
>>> The caption says, <<<
The monster is dispatched to the dark world by the sight of its most feared object.
>>>  Dogbert stands on the conference table holding a document in front of the man.  Dogbert says, <<<
Look!  Actual code!
>>>  The man's head melts into his shirt and a co-worker says, <<<
Cool!
>>> 
1995-11-08 * 
Dilbert, Wally, Alice and the Boss sit at a conference table.  Dilbert says, <<<
The project status is 'yellow light.'
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
In user tests we found that the product locks up every twelve seconds.  The interface is incomprehensible and the manual is pure fiction.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I think it's clear what we need to do . . .
>>>  The Boss asks, <<<
Ship it and hope somebody writes a 'Dummies' book about it?
>>> 
1995-11-07 * 
Dilbert enters the office kitchen where a man is putting a sign on the coffee maker that says, <<<
Coffee maker.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Why are you putting a sign on the coffee maker?
>>> The man says, <<<
It's an ISO 9000 requirement.  Everything must be clearly labeled.  There can be no exceptions.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
That's stupid.
>>> The man walks away saying, <<<
Believe me, I don't like it any more than you do.
>>>  The man's shirt has a label on the back that says, <<<
Stupid label guy.
>>> 
1995-11-06 * 
Ratbert approaches Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
I've come to be your personal digital assistant.
>>> Ratbert hands Dilbert a pen and says, <<<
Use the little pen to write messages on my stomach.  I'll use state-of-the-rat technology to interpret your handwriting.
>>> As Dilbert writes on Ratbert's stomach, Ratbert says, <<<
Weave . . . me . . . a . . . cone . . . yoo . . . cupid . . . bat . . .
>>> 
1995-11-05 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk and says, <<<
I worked all night but I finished the presentation package you wanted.
>>> The Boss looks at a transparency and says, <<<
Put the presentation date on each page.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Those are color transparencies.  It would take hours and cost hundreds of dollars to reprint them.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
There's no reason to date them.  In fact, it would limit future use and clutter the page.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But since you're incapable of admitting error . . .
>>> Dilbert bows and continues, <<<
I eagerly await your bizarre, other-worldly explanation for putting the date on each page.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Some people might not have calendars and we have to make sure it's not a holiday.
>>>  There is an explosion. A cloud of smoke hovers where Dilbert's head should be.  Dilbert says, <<<
Ouch.  My brain exploded.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
The first presentation is February 30th . . .
>>> 
1995-11-04 * 
Dilbert watches Dogbert and Bob the Dinosaur hanging paintings on the office wall.  He asks Dogbert, <<<
How did you get the contract to supply our company with wall art?
>>>  Dogbert answers, <<<
Low bid.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
As we speak, my assistant is scouring the earth in search of low-cost art.
>>> Ratbert stands outside the <<<
School-O-Art" with a bag of money.  As an art student wearing a beret and painter's smock is thrown out of the school with his painting, Ratbert says, <<<
I'll take it!!
>>> 
1995-11-03 * 
Dogbert and the Boss sit at a table looking at a catalog.  Dogbert says, <<<
The 'Dogbert Corporate Art Source' will provide low-cost paintings for your walls.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Our motto is 'if it's in a frame it will look like art to you.'
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
How much do the paintings cost?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Six dollars a pound.
>>> 
1995-11-02 * 
Dilbert stands behind Wally's desk and says, <<<
I heard you got assigned on a 'dotted line' to our boss's arch-rival.
>>>  Wally sits with his head in his hands and groans. Dilbert continues, <<<
Look on the bright side.  Think of yourself as leading the exiting life of a secret double-agent!
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Don't most double-agents get captured and executed immediately?
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
They WISH it was immediate.
>>> 
1995-11-01 * 
Catbert peers over the wall of Wally's cubicle and says, <<<
Guess what, Wally.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
What sadistic plot has HR come up with now, Catbert?
>>> Catbert shows Wally an org chart and says, <<<
We're giving you a real boss plus a 'dotted line' to another boss who has different objectives.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
The status reports alone will take forty hours a week.
>>>  Wally opens a stapler and says, <<<
I'm gonna staple myself to death.
>>> 
1995-10-31 * 
Wally says to the Boss, <<<
I don't understand how the new reorganization will help us 'focus on our core business.'
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Did our core business change?  Or are you saying that EVERY reorg prior to this was a misdirected failure?
>>> The Boss asks hypothetically, <<<
Wally, when a car gets a flat tire, what do you do?
>>>  Wally answers, <<<
Well, if I'm you, I rotate the tires and drive home.
>>> 
1995-10-30 * 
The caption says, <<<
Headquarters.
>>>  Three executives sit at a conference table.  One says to the man next to him, <<<
Hey, Chuck's looking unhappy today.  What's the problem, big guy?
>>> Chuck says, <<<
All of my bad decisions are catching up to me.  Could we do another reorg to cover my tracks?
>>>  The third executive says, <<<
Yeah, I've got some bodies to bury, too.
>>> Back at the office, the Boss reads a document aloud to Dilbert and Wally, <<<
. . . These changes will allow us to focus on our core business.
>>>  Wally walks away saying, <<<
Whoa!  Let me get my reorg boots.
>>> 
1995-10-29 * 
Dilbert asks a secretary, <<<
Helen, do you have any staples in the supply cabinet?
>>> Helen replies, <<<
No, I only stock the basics: cheap pens with green ink, big jars of glue and ribbons for obsolete printers.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Could you order some staples?
>>>  Helen says, <<<
You need to give me the order number.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Okay.  Can I see your supply catalog?
>>>  Helen replies, <<<
Wally borrowed it.
>>> Dilbert covers his eyes and sobs.  The phone rings and Helen says, <<<
I'd better get that; it might be personal.
>>> Dilbert stands in the doorway and says, <<<
Wally, do you have the . . .
>>>  Wally interrupts, <<<
I need your help with this.  Pull up a chair.
>>> Alice appears and says, <<<
I need both of you to come talk to a vendor that we'll never use.
>>> Dilbert arrives at home and tells Dogbert, <<<
Thanks to teamwork, I almost stapled something today.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm so proud to know you.
>>> 
1995-10-28 * 
Dilbert hums as he stacks binders outside the door of his cubicle.  Wally says, <<<
It looks like somebody is using binders to illegally increase the size of his cubicle.
>>> Wally says angrily, <<<
You think your status will increase with your cubicle size, don't you!  Well, it won't work!
>>> The Boss walks over, hands Dilbert a check and says, <<<
Here's a raise.  I don't know why.
>>>  A woman whispers to Wally, <<<
Pssst.  Is he seeing anybody?
>>>  Wally growls, <<<
RRRR.
>>> 
1995-10-27 * 
A co-worker says to Dilbert, <<<
Three other people asked for that same information.  You must be on redundant projects.
>>> The man hands Dilbert a binder and says, <<<
Here's a big binder which at first glance seems useful, but you'll realize later it's not.
>>> The man says, <<<
I've got a few more useless binders.  Do you want 'em?
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Sure.  I'm using them to build an addition to my cubicle.
>>> 
1995-10-26 * 
Wally and Dilbert stand in front of the Boss's desk.  Dilbert says, <<<
Wally and I have a bet about why you assigned me to the same task as three other people.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I believe it's a clever ploy to create healthy internal competition.  Wally thinks you're just dumber than the average cauliflower.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
May I point out that cauliflower is the brain of the fruit kingdom.
>>>  Wally looks at Dilbert and says, <<<
Yes!
>>> 
1995-10-25 * 
Dilbert lies on the couch with his knees bent and Dogbert sits on the backrest.  Dilbert says, <<<
Terrible news: my boss assigned me to a fun and valuable project.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Uh-oh.  That means at least three morons will be assigned to similar projects.  You must find them and crush them . . .
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Exactly.
>>> Back at the office, Dilbert enters a co-worker's cubicle and says, <<<
Carl, old buddy, whatcha workin' on these days?
>>>  Carl waves his hands and says, <<<
Nothing fun and valuable.  Shoo shoo!!
>>> 
1995-10-24 * 
The Boss approaches Carol's desk and says, <<<
Carol, about this flight to New York that you booked for me . . .
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Is it really necessary to make all these stopovers in Third-World countries that are experiencing rebel insurrections?
>>> Carol holds up a bullseye and says, <<<
You'd better wear the international symbol of the 'Red Cross' on your back.
>>> 
1995-10-23 * 
Dogbert sits at a desk.  A voice from heaven says, <<<
We've decided to revoke your angel status.  You're giving us all a bad name.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Your problem is that you define 'healing' too narrowly.  I'm making ugly people look attractive, and that's important, too.
>>> Wally approaches Dogbert's desk.  Wally's head has been replaced with Dogbert's head.  He asks Dogbert, <<<
Is it too late to go back to my old look?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Why?  You're beautiful!
>>> 
1995-10-22 * 
The Boss puts a transparency on the overhead projector and says, <<<
This graphic shows our biggest obstacle to success.
>>> The diagram shows an arrow through a series of acronyms. Alice, Dilbert and Wally sit at the conference table looking confused. Wally asks, <<<
Are you saying our biggest obstacle to success is poor graphics?
>>> Alice replies, <<<
I think he's saying our biggest problem is his overall inability to communicate.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I think his point goes beyond communication.  He's showing us that he doesn't even THINK clearly!
>>>  Wally says, <<<
That's it!
>>> Alice says, <<<
High five!!
>>>  Wally shouts, <<<
You broke the code!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You know how I said you should participate more in meetings?  I didn't mean it.
>>> 
1995-10-21 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at a table in a restaurant.  Dilbert asks, <<<
Are you saying that you're an angel now?  And you have special powers to help people.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Exactly.  I instinctively know what people want and I can give it to them with a snap of the paw.
>>>  Dogbert snaps in the direction of the waitress. Dilbert asks, <<<
Are you having any trouble controlling it?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
My aim stinks.
>>>  Behind them, a waiter looks shocked to see that he suddenly has large breasts.  The waitress looks angry. 
1995-10-20 * 
Two angels approach Dogbert, who is wearing a halo, and say, <<<
Mister Dogbert, we've decided to send you back to earth as an angel.
>>> One angel says, <<<
Your mission is to help people in need.  We have given you special powers.
>>>  The other says, <<<
We'll be watching.
>>> Back on earth, Dogbert sits at a desk and Wally sits across from him.  Wally asks, <<<
Okay, so what's the price for new hair PLUS buns of steel?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
It's all on the price sheet.
>>>  From heaven a voice says, <<<
Ahem.
>>> 
1995-10-19 * 
Dogbert stands on a cloud across from an angel at a podium.  The angel says, <<<
Welcome to heaven, Mister Dogbert.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Wow, it looks like you guys relaxed your standards!
>>> The angel says, <<<
Dogs are automatic.  No matter what you do, there's always a place in heaven for every little dog.
>>> Dogbert takes the angel's halo off and stands on the podium.  The angel puts his hands on his hips and says angrily, <<<
I'd like that back now, if you don't mind!!
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
What kind of distance can you get with these little 'Frisbees?'
>>> 
1995-10-18 * 
Dogbert stands on a woman's desk wearing a gas mask.  He says, <<<
I have failed in my attempt to subtly tell you that your perfume is killing people.  I will try a direct approach.
>>> Dogbert removes the mask and screams, <<<
Hey!! You smell bad!!! B-a-a-a-d!!
>>> Dilbert collapses onto the desk and the woman asks, <<<
Should I give you CPR?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
No-o-o-o!!  Let me die!!
>>> 
1995-10-17 * 
Dilbert hands Dogbert a gas mask and says, <<<
Dogbert, your mission is to tell my co-worker that her perfume is killing us.  Wear this gas mask.
>>> As Dilbert puts the mask on Dogbert, he says, <<<
Use humor to ease the tension.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Good idea.
>>> Wearing the mask, Dogbert stands in the woman's cubicle and says, <<<
Did you hear the joke about the woman who stank like a hog rendering plant?
>>>  The woman says, <<<
Three times today . . .
>>> 
1995-10-16 * 
A woman walks by Wally's cubicle and thinks, <<<
I wonder if I'm wearing enough fragrance.
>>>  Clouds of odor surround her body.  Inside his cubicle, Wally whips his head around to look at her. Wally is overcome by the odor and falls over in his chair screaming, <<<
AIEEEEE!!
>>> As she leaves a trail of unconscious employees behind her, the woman thinks, <<<
I'd better increase the dosage until I hear some compliments.
>>> 
1995-10-15 * 
Dogbert sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss asks, <<<
Why do you want to be our new 'Long Range Planner,' Mister Dogbert?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Because 'long range' is very far away . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
. . . Therefore it will be impossible to evaluate my performance.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
If it's not too much to ask, I'd like to be on flex-time so you'll never know if I'm supposed to be at work.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I'll need an Internet connection at home so I can telecommute and not pollute.  Because I give a hoot.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Also, I'd like to be in a group with lots of losers.  That way I'll get the biggest riase when we're ranked.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You're hired.  All of the other applicants demanded relocation expenses and I have no budget for that.
>>> Dogbert stands at a desk.  Dilbert asks, <<<
Why do I have to work while you just look for poodle graphics on the Internet?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Don't work too hard; I'd like a big raise.
>>> 
1995-10-14 * 
An employee sits in Catbert's office.  The man says, <<<
My job is too stressful.  Can I see a company counselor?
>>> As he plays with the ball of string on his desk, Catbert replies, <<<
I re-engineered our counseling process.  Now we put you in a big hole and cover you with sand.
>>> The man stands in the hole while Catbert kicks sand onto him.  The employee says, <<<
If this is my only benefit I'd better get a LOT of sand!
>>>  Catbert says, <<<
Just keep your mouth open.
>>> 
1995-10-13 * 
Catbert and the Boss stand on either side of a hole in the floor.  Catbert says, <<<
As Director of Human Resources I have developed a policy for handling the employees who complain.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
It's a big hole.  I'll trick the whiners into getting in it.  And then I'll cover them with sand.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I don't see how this could possibly work.
>>>  Catbert says, <<<
There's a detailed explanation at the bottom of the hole.
>>> 
1995-10-12 * 
The Boss sits at a desk. Dilbert reads a printout and says, <<<
Our original project time line was twelve months . . . But since you pitched in to help . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I don't have an exact date, but it's roughly the same time that the sun becomes a cold dark chunk of coal the size of your forehead.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We'll need flashlights.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
And sweaters.  It could get nippy.
>>> 
1995-10-11 * 
The Boss sits at a computer and Wally and Dilbert stand behind him.  The Boss raises his hands over the keyboard and says, <<<
Okay, just show me how to program so I can help out on your project.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You're going to build a 'G.U.I.' using object-oriented development tools . . .
>>> Wally adds, <<<
G.U.I. is pronounced 'gooey.'
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I used my gun object to blast the bug object in the hall object!!
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Notice how gooey it is.
>>> 
1995-10-10 * 
Dilbert and Wally sit at a desk.  The Boss enters and says, <<<
I've decided to get more involved with your project.
>>>  Wally and Dilbert think, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I'm just going to roll up my sleeves and pitch in.
>>> Trying to unbutton his sleeve cuffs, the Boss says, <<<
Does anybody know how to work these buttons?
>>>  Wally covers his eyes with his hands and Dilbert leans back in disgust. 
1995-10-09 * 
The Boss, Wally, Dilbert and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
We'll succeed if we understand who our competitors really are!
>>> Wally says, <<<
My competition is Dilbert and Alice, with whom I compete for salary increases and rare promotion opportunities.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I meant our external competition.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Tell me again what we make.
>>>  Dilbert whispers to Wally, <<<
No raise for you, idiot boy.
>>> 
1995-10-08 * 
Wally, Dilbert and Alice walk out of a conference room.  Wally says, <<<
That's four hours that I'd like to have back.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Who called that meeting anyway?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I must have left my calendar in there.
>>> Dilbert walks into the room and sees a man grabbing doughnuts from a plate on the conference table. Dilbert says, <<<
I've discovered a primitive donut-scavenging man clad only in yellow sticky notes!!
>>> The man says, <<<
I was once like you, before the great rif.
>>> The man continues, <<<
But rather than leave in humiliation I decided to stay and live off the land like our proud ancestors.
>>> The man says as he dances, <<<
To ensure a bountiful harvest I do my donut dance to the gods.
>>> The man continues, <<<
When that doesn't work I distribute meeting notices.
>>>  Dilbert shouts, <<<
YOU're the one!!
>>> 
1995-10-07 * 
Dogbert stands in the cabin of the corporate jet wearing a parachute on his back.  He says to the CEO, <<<
It looks like the plane's going down and there's only one parachute.
>>>  The CEO looks shocked. The CEO grabs the parachute and screams, <<<
Give it to me!!!  I'm a CEO with a Harvard MBA.  You're a dog!!
>>> Dogbert and the CEO fall through the air wearing packs on their backs.  Dogbert says to the CEO, <<<
That's my knapsack.
>>>  As some fruit and loose paper falls out of the CEO's pack, he says, <<<
Old joke.
>>> 
1995-10-06 * 
The corporate jet flies over the mountains.  From the cockpit, Dogbert says, <<<
This is Captain Dogbert with some good news and some bad news.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
The good news is that we'll be hitting town ten minutes ahead of schedule . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
The bad news is we'll be hitting town.
>>> 
1995-10-05 * 
The corporate jet flies through the air.  From the cockpit, Dogbert announces, <<<
This is your captain speaking . . .
>>> Dogbert sits at the controls with the microphone in his hand.  He continues, <<<
If you'd like to land safely, there's something I've always wanted to see a CEO do.
>>> The CEO puts his head out of the airplane window and sticks out his tongue.  He thinks, <<<
This is so NOT funny.
>>> 
1995-10-04 * 
Dogbert sits in the cockpit of an airplane.  He says, <<<
Attention, passenger.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I'm Captain Dogbert.  This is my first flight.  I'll bet you wish you hadn't cut the corporate training budget.
>>>  The passenger, the CEO of the company, looks shocked. Dogbert continues, <<<
For safety, keep an eye out the window . . . If it looks like we're gonna hit the ground, try jumping up right before impact.
>>>  The passenger looks scared. 
1995-10-03 * 
A man reads Dogbert's resume and asks him, <<<
Your resume doesn't list any experience as a jet pilot, Mister Dogbert.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
How hard could it be?
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
You could spend a lot of money on some pretty boy pilot with experience, or you can save a few bucks and have ME drive the corporate jet.
>>> The man says, <<<
I AM under a lot of budget pressure . . . And I'm not allowed on the jet myself . . .
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
It has a pilot eject seat, right?
>>> 
1995-10-02 * 
The Boss, Carol, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
We're poised for success.  We expect huge earnings and increased market share!
>>> Looking at a document, the Boss says, <<<
Next on the agenda . . . There will be no raises because it will be a difficult year . . .
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Carol, I thought I told you to put the 'United Way' update between those two agenda items.
>>>  Carol says, <<<
Oopsie.
>>> 
1995-10-01 * 
Dilbert wears a suit and holds a briefcase.  He says, <<<
Wish me luck, Dogbert.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
If you get more luck, wouldn't there be less luck available for me?
>>> A woman at a desk looks at Dilbert's application and says, <<<
For 'desired salary' you wrote 'one million dollars.'
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Yes, thanks for asking.
>>> The woman says, <<<
Perhaps the question is misleading.  The application should have asked what salary you EXPECT.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Oh . . . Well, I expect you'll hire somebody more qualified and my salary will remain unchanged.
>>> The woman says, <<<
No, too honest.  I'm looking for something CLOSE to reality, with maybe twenty-percent fantasy layered on top.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Okay . . . I'd like a fifteen-percent raise and a little shoulder massage.
>>> Back at home, Dilbert asks Dogbert, <<<
Why does it seem that I'm the only honest guy on earth?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Your type tends not to reproduce.
>>> 
1995-09-30 * 
Dilbert holds a mouse by the tail.  The mouse says, <<<
You're making a big mistake.  I'm no ordinary mouse.  If you kiss me I'll turn into a prince!!!
>>> The mouse continues, <<<
Did I say 'Prince?'  I meant I'd become the symbol for the performer formerly known as Prince.  Ha ha ha!!  Get it?
>>> Dilbert the mouse in a trash container.  The mouse says, <<<
You're immune to both romance and mirth.  You must be a . . . a . . .
>>>  Dilbert answers, <<<
That's right.  I'm an engineer.
>>> 
1995-09-29 * 
Dilbert stands in front of Alice's desk.  Alice has a crown on her head and is holding a document in her hand.  She says, <<<
I will approve your expense voucher on one condition.
>>> Alice continues, <<<
You must slay the creature who stalks the office at night and eats our hidden snacks.
>>> Dilbert holds a baseball bat in one hand and opens a drawer with the other.  A mouse peers out of the drawer.  Dilbert says to him, <<<
It has to be either you or the security guard.
>>>  The mouse answers, <<<
Slay him first and see if the problem stops.
>>> 
1995-09-28 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Wally peers into Dilbert's cubicle and yells, <<<
Alice is sitting in for the boss!
>>> Dilbert stands up, raises both hands in the air and shouts, <<<
Productivity at last!!!
>>>  Wally yells, <<<
Efficiency!  Yes!!
>>> Inside the cubicle, Wally says, <<<
As long as she doesn't get an attitude . . .
>>>  Alice stands outside the cubicle with a crown on her head and a wand in her hand.  Someone is bowing in front of her. 
1995-09-27 * 
Dogbert hands a document to the Boss and says, <<<
Here are the results of my ISO 9000 audit of your company.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Your employees are largely untrained and - I couldn't help notice - fairly unattractive.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
However, they are also highly skilled liars, so you passed the audit easily.
>>>  The Boss raises his arm in the air and shouts, <<<
We succeed where it counts!!!
>>> 
1995-09-26 * 
Dogbert says to Alice, <<<
I've been hired by your company to perform an ISO 9000 audit.
>>> Looking at his laptop PC, Dogbert says, <<<
Basically, you give me money and I tell you that you're a bunch of dolts.  It's the perfect job for me.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Tell me what you do here, Alice, if that's your real name.
>>>  Alice replies, <<<
I'm an engineer.  I make slides that people can't read.  Sometimes I eat donuts.
>>> 
1995-09-25 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert and Wally, <<<
We're having an ISO 9000 audit this week.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Take a look at your documented job descriptions and make sure that it's what you're doing if the auditor asks.
>>> Looking at his job description, Dilbert says, <<<
According to this I'm some sort of engineer.
>>>  Wally, looking at his, says, <<<
As if we'd have time for that . . .
>>> 
1995-09-24 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
I have to take a contract to our company lawyer.  I need your help, Dogbert.
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert sit in front of a lawyer's desk.  Dilbert says, <<<
Please review this contract.  I need it today.
>>> The attorney replies, <<<
Give me all of your copies plus the original then go away.
>>> Dogbert screams, <<<
Don't do it!  He plans to lose them!!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Good dog!
>>>  The lawyer says, <<<
Dang!
>>> The lawyer looks at the contract and says, <<<
I can't approve this.  Somebody might sue us for no good reason.
>>> Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
That's true with any contract.  Isn't he using absurd logic?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Let's find out.
>>> Dogbert stands on his chair and shouts, <<<
Approve the contract now or I'll sue you for obstruction of dogs!!
>>>  The lawyer says, <<<
Okay okay.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Wow.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
The great thing about absurd logic is that it fits any situation.
>>> 
1995-09-23 * 
The Boss approaches Wally and Dilbert.  The Boss says, <<<
I found software that helps managers write performance evaluations!
>>>  Dilbert and Wally both say, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It's made by the same company that makes fortune cookies for Canada!
>>>  Wally says, <<<
That makes me feel better.
>>> The caption says, <<<
Next Day.
>>>  The Boss offers Wally and Dilbert small strips of paper.  Dilbert says, <<<
I didn't think you knew how to use a PC.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
My secretary wrote these.
>>>  Wally reads a strip aloud, <<<
Don't by a new car.
>>> 
1995-09-22 * 
The Boss approaches Alice who is seated at her desk.  He asks, <<<
Alice, I've decided to add a resource to your project.
>>> Alice screams, <<<
We're human beings, not 'resources!!'
>>> The Boss looks stunned as he replies, <<<
Would it help if I told you that resources are our most valuable asset?
>>> 
1995-09-21 * 
Dogbert sits on the armrest of a couch.  Dilbert, with a phone in his hand, says, <<<
I've been on hold for tech support since Tuesday.  Get Bob and meet me in the car.
>>> Dilbert is driving with Dogbert in the passenger seat.  Bob the Dinosaur says from the back seat, <<<
I can't wait to try my newest maneuver, the 'Turban Wedgie.'
>>> Bob is holding the tech support person in the air.  The tech support person has a turban on his head.  Bob says to Dilbert, <<<
It starts like a regular wedgie then I wrap it around his head.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Question . . .
>>> 
1995-09-20 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk with a telephone in his hand.  A voice on the phone says, <<<
Press 'One' for sales.  Press 'Two' in a hopeless effort to get technical support.
>>>  Dilbert presses <<<

Press 'Two' if you're willing to buy something just so you can talk to a human being . . .

Fortunately I anticipated your reaction.

Where are you taking all that office equipment?

I'm having a garage sale.

Our new company slogan is 'Act like you own the company.'  So I've been selling the stuff that I don't use and keeping the money.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Is that my new color monitor?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
Yeah, I never use that thing.
>>> 
1995-09-17 * 
Dilbert, Wally and a woman from marketing sit at a conference table.  The woman sits in front of a computer and says, <<<
It's time for marketing to put the glitter on this software you've created.
>>> She continues, <<<
With my guidance this will become the premier data backup software!
>>> Wally says, <<<
Bear in mind that we said it would take six months to write it.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
You only gave us a month.
>>> The woman says, <<<
We'll fix the bugs in the next release.  Tell me about the features.
>>> Wally says, <<<
At this point, all it does is erase your disk drive.
>>>  Dilbert adds, <<<
Unless you're on a network.
>>> The woman asks, <<<
What happens if you're on a network?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
It erases everybody's disk drives.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
And heaven help you if you have a modem . . .
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
It calls all your friends and erases their PCs.

We'll call it 'QuikProtect.'"  Dilbert adds, <<<

Dilbert hands his timesheet to a secretary and says, <<<
Here's my timesheet, filled out in increments of fifteen minutes.

As usual, I coded the useless hours spent in meetings as 'work,' whereas the time I spent in the shower designing circuits in my mind as 'non-work.'
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Interestingly, even the time I spend complaining about my lack of productivity is considered 'work.'"  The secretary thinks, <<<
I hate my life.
>>> 
1995-09-14 * 
Dilbert is standing in front of the copying machine.  Reaching inside the copier, a man says, <<<
Here's the problem. We've got a whole nest of paper trolls.

AAIIEE!

If I call 911 now I'll never know if the lower paper tray would have worked.
>>> 
1995-09-13 * 
Wally stands behind Dilbert's desk.  Dilbert says, <<<
I'm writing an e-mail to protest the new policy of making the employees empty their own trash at night.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
It's stupid to have highly paid engineers doing unproductive tasks when we could be inventing the future!
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Are you coming to the 'Quality Faire?'"  Dilbert answers, <<<
No, this will take another hour.
>>> 
1995-09-12 * 
The Boss sits in front of Catbert's desk.  The Boss asks, <<<

Jack will be in charge of project 'Goosefood.'
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I'd like you two to brief Jack on the project.
>>> Jack, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  Dilbert says, <<<
Project 'Goosefood' has no budget and no management support.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Your job is to build a global information network in two weeks.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Failure is certain.  Soon you will leave the industry in disgrace.
>>> Wally adds, <<<
. . . Just like the other 'best managers' we hired from our competitors.
>>> Jack says, <<<
Just our of curiosity, how did the project get its name?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
Let's just say that you're the goose food . . .
>>> 
1995-09-09 * 
Dilbert sits in his cubicle thinking, <<<
I need to think 'outside the box' to come up with a creative design . . .

I push my chair into the hallway to change my viewpoint and stimulate my creative juices.
>>> The Boss approaches and Dilbert thinks, <<<
Suddenly my juice dries up.
>>>  The Boss points at Dilbert and says, <<<
You're a fire hazard. Do your thinking inside your box.
>>> 
1995-09-08 * 
Alice sits at her desk with her back to Wally. Wally asks, <<<
Alice, I'm thinking about quitting and becoming a contract employee.  Do you have any advice?
>>> Alice replies, <<<
Sleep in doorways so it doesn't rain on you.  The best shopping carts are at 'Lucky.'  You can make an excellent sign with black marking pen and a hunk of cardboard.
>>> Wally walks away from Alice's cubicle and says, <<<
I hate all of my co-workers.
>>>  Alice says, <<<
Despite the name, food stamps are NOT edible.
>>> 
1995-09-07 * 
Wally and Dilbert are walking.  Wally says, <<<
I should quit and become a contract employee.  Then I'd have more income and I'd feel the wind in my hair.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's possible you'd have no income at all . . .
>>> Dilbert puts his arms up in the air and says, <<<
And if you want wind your hair you'll have to take off your shirt and run around with your arms up.
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
Thank you for your support.
>>> 
1995-09-06 *

My inspirational posters aren't working.  I need to do some animal research, Ratbert.
>>>  Ratbert answers, <<<
Ready!!
>>> The Boss holds up the poster and asks, <<<
In this beautiful scene we see a mighty eagle swooping down to capture its prey. What is your reaction?
>>>  Ratbert shakes in fear. The Boss thinks, <<<
I think it's working.
>>>  Ratbert screams, <<<
Run for it, mom!!!
>>> 
1995-09-05 * 
The boss holds a poster in front of his face.  He says to Alice, <<<
My new inspirational poster is so effective that I decided to carry it with me.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
What do you think, Alice?  Are you inspired?
>>>  Alice replies, <<<
I'd really have to see the front . . .
>>> The boss responds, <<<
Hmm . . . I don't think there's a win-win scenario here.
>>>  Alice rolls her eyes and walks away saying, <<<
Tell me about it . . .
>>> 
1995-09-04 * 
The Boss shouts at Wally and Dilbert, <<<
Profits are down, morale is sinking; it's time for bold leadership!!
>>> The Boss holds up some posters and continues, <<<
So I got some inspirational posters featuring a variety of relevant nature scenes.
>>> The Boss shows the poster to Wally and Dilbert and says, <<<
I think you can relate to this scene.
>>>  Wally asks, <<<
Am I the seagull or the clam?
>>>

Dilbert sits at his desk in his bathrobe.  Dogbert says, <<<
My laptop PC keeps freezing up.  Come take a look at it.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
I'm telecommuting, Dogbert.  I can't be distracted by home projects.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Don't come another step closer.  This is my virtual cubicle, within which I can not be disturbed.
>>> Dilbert spreads his arms and continues, <<<
These invisible walls form a cone of productivity around me.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Within this zone I am a dedicated employee, totally focused on the corporate vision.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Nothing can distract me from my firm commitment to the work-at-home principle.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Fine.  I think I'll set the couch on fire.
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the table working on a laptop.  Dogbert says, <<<
Another victory for the distractor!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I swear, someday principle will win!
>>> 
1995-09-02 * 
Dilbert approaches a door that is labeled, <<<
Records Retention.
>>> In the Records Retention Office, Dilbert hands a pile of documents to the librarian and says, <<<
These valuable documents should be stored for five years.
>>> As he throws the documents in the trash bin, the librarian thinks, <<<
This job got so much easier when I realized that nobody ever asks for anything back.
>>> 
1995-09-01 * 
Dogbert and Tina are sitting at a table.  Dogbert says to the reader, <<<
This week, we introduced Tina the Brittle Tech Writer to the strip.  Tina is dysfunctional like everybody here except me.

RRRR.

Send your opinions by e-mail to scottadams@aol.com.  It's the only way we can learn.
>>>  Tina growls, <<<
RRRR.

The doctor is in!

The caption reads, <<<
Dogbert tweaks Tina the brittle tech writer.
>>>  Dogbert asks Tina, <<<
What do you think of the movie 'Thelma and Louise?'
>>> Tina responds, <<<
I know what you're trying to say.  You think all women are bad drivers.  That's really the point of the movie, isn't it??
>>> The caption reads, <<<
If you're not offended yet, tune in tomorrow.
>>>  Dogbert asks Tina, <<<
The 'Three Stooges?'"  Tina cries, <<<
Why are ALL of the documentaries about MEN??!
>>> 
1995-08-29 * 
Dogbert stands behind Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
I feel like tweaking some brittle people.  Do you known any brittle people?
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
Try Tina the tech writer.  She believes that all forms of expression are an insult to her gender and her profession.
>>> Dogbert says to Tina, <<<
The statue of 'Venus de Milo' has no arms.
>>>  Tina replies angrily, <<<
Oh, I get it.  You're saying that women can't lift heavy objects.
>>> 
1995-08-28 * 
The Boss says to Tina who is seated at her computer, <<<
Tina, you'll have to have all the documentation written by next week so we can ship it when the software is done.
>>> Tina says angrily, <<<
How can I write instructions for something that doesn't exist yet?
>>>  The Boss answers, <<<
You'll have to make logical guesses.
>>> Tina types on her computer, <<<
If you press any key your computer will lock up.  If you call our tech support we'll blame 'Microsoft.'
>>> 
1995-08-27 * 
Wally sits at his desk and Dilbert stands behind him.  The Boss enters and says, <<<
I made a few changes to the design.
>>> Dilbert reads a document and looks shocked.  He says, <<<
We'll have to work around the clock for months to make these changes!!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Work smarter, not harder.
>>> Wally looks at the changes and says, <<<
You're trying to violate the laws of physics!
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Rules were made to be broken.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
This design would create enough radiation to instantly kill the user!!
>>> The Boss walks away and says, <<<
Be sure to mention that in the documentation.
>>> Dilbert says to Wally, <<<
Let's work smarter not harder.
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
I think we found the only 'beta' tester we'll need.
>>> 
1995-08-26 * 
Bob the Dinosaur says to Dogbert, <<<
Sometimes I feel self-conscious because my brain is so tiny.
>>> Bob continues, <<<
Here, let me reach in my ear and pull it out.
>>> Dogbert looks at what Bob is holding in his hand and says, <<<
I think that's ear wax, Bob.
>>>  Bob replies, <<<
Maybe. But I'm putting it back just in case.
>>>

The caption reads, <<<
Dilbert is trapped in the bowels of accounting.

I understand you have Dilbert in there.  Free him, or else . . .

Else what?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Or else I will put this cap on my head BACKWARDS!  Your little hardwired accounting brain will explode just looking at it.
>>> Wearing the cap backwards, Dogbert approaches Dilbert who is still hanging over the pit.  Dilbert asks, <<<
What was that popping sound?
>>>  Dogbert answers, <<<
A paradigm shifting without a clutch.
>>>

Dilbert is tied up and hanging upside down.  A demonlike clerk says to him, <<<
You spent nearly $10 per day on meals during your trip.

The travel guidelines require you to stun a pigeon with your briefcase on the way to the hotel then fry it up on your travel iron.
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
I tried . . . but it was taking so long.
>>>  The clerk suggests, <<<
Try the 'wool' setting.
>>> 
1995-08-23 * 
Dilbert is seated in front of a demonlike clerk.  The clerk yells, <<<
What are you trying to pull??  Do you think we're idiots in accounting?!!
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
No, I swear, I think you're smart but sadistic trolls with many humanoid characteristics.
>>> Dilbert's hands and feet are bound and he is hanging upside down above a pit.  He thinks to himself, <<<
Apparently there was no right answer.
>>> 
1995-08-22 * 
Dilbert approaches a window labeled <<<
Soul Check" where a clerk who looks like a demon is standing.  He says to the clerk behind the window, <<<
If it's okay, I'll hold onto my soul while I visit the accounting department.
>>> Dilbert is in the accounting department, talking to another demonlike clerk seated at a desk.  Dilbert says, <<<
I came to answer your questions about my expense report.
>>>  The clerk replies, <<<
Take a seat.
>>> Dilbert notices there are no seats, but only sharp, pointed stalagmites and stalactites in the cavelike room.  He thinks to himself, <<<
I don't like the way this is starting.
>>> 
1995-08-21 * 
A female employee hands a document to Dilbert and says, <<<
Your report was rejected by accounting.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Why?
>>> The woman responds, <<<
Because the emptiness of their shallow lives makes them want to hurt others in order to validate their pathetic existence.
>>> Dilbert asks the woman, <<<
Can you help me clear this up?
>>>  She responds, <<<
To be honest, I'm kinda buying in to their philosophy.
>>> 
1995-08-20 * 
The Boss walks by and Dilbert says to him, <<<
Please don't promise the product manager more than we can deliver.
>>> The product manager says to the Boss, <<<
We need a totally new software interface in one month.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
You got it!
>>> The woman continues, <<<
And rewrite the operating system so we dominate the industry.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Concurrent development.  Check.
>>> The woman thinks, <<<
Suddenly I feel omnipotent.
>>> She stands up and says, <<<
I want all new hardware, anti-gravity packaging, holographic agents . . .
>>>  The Boss yawns. The manager asks, <<<
Can your team really do that in a month?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Let me get their reaction.
>>> The Boss shows Wally a document.  Wally screams and his skull pops out of his mouth. Wally lies on the floor twitching.  The Boss says, <<<
Pessimism will not look good on your permformance review.
>>> 
1995-08-19 * 
Dilbert says to the Boss as he walks by, <<<
I know where you're going.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
You're going to a meeting where equally uninformed managers will make decisions that neuter the work I did all week.
>>> Alice says to Dilbert, <<<
You didn't do any work this week.
>>>  Dilbert answers, <<<
I think I've got this whole 'work' concept figured out.
>>> 
1995-08-18 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I significantly increased by visibility at work today, Dogbert.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Yesterday I was invisible to my management.  But today I am known by all.

You screwed up, huh?
>>>  Dilbert responds, <<<
Ooh yeah.  Big time.
>>> 
1995-08-17 * 
The Boss is surprised to see Ratbert hanging in midair.  Ratbert says, <<<
Don't be alarmed.  I'm not really a rat floating in midair.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
I'm clinging to the back of an employee who has been rendered invisible by a long succession of worthless assignments.
>>> The Boss comments, <<<
Looks like an isolated case of bad attitude.
>>>  Behind the Boss, a beaver is suspended in midair.  The beaver asks, <<<
Which room is the 'quality' meeting in?
>>> 
1995-08-16 * 
Dogbert says to Dilbert, <<<
You're invisible to your co-workers.  But you can compensate by forming a symbiotic relationship with a visible creature.
>>> Ratbert joins Dilbert and Dogbert.  Dogbert continues, <<<
Ratbert will cling to your back.  He'll be your visual and auditory link with your co-workers.
>>> Ratbert is suspended in midair between Wally and Alice.  Ratbert says to Wally, <<<
So . . . working hard?  Or hardly working?

I KNEW this Colombian coffee was trouble.

The dehumanization of my job has rendered me invisible to humans.  Only you can see me, Dogbert.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How can we fix this?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
You could wear a bag on your head when you're around me.
>>> Dilbert clenches his fists and answers, <<<
That's not the fix I had in mind.
>>>  Dogbert responds, <<<
It's not a perfect solution.  I'd still be able to hear you.
>>> 
1995-08-14 * 
Dilbert, Wally and the Boss sit at a conference table.  Dilbert says, <<<
My status for the week is that the ongoing dehumanization from my job has caused me to doubt my existence.

There is reason to believe I am becoming invisible.

Do I hear your pager buzzing, Wally?

We'll leverage our technology by building ant farms.

Spreadsheets make the idea look profitable.
>>>  The Boss and the man sit at a conference table.  The man says, <<<
The ant milk alone will be a positive NPV!
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Wow!
>>>  He thinks, <<<
What's an NPV?
>>> The caption says, <<<
Don't forget the 'worst case scenario.'"  The man says, <<<
Worst case, somebody builds a gigantic magnifying glass next door.
>>> The man contines, <<<
Solution: bite-sized ant jerky!
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
There's no risk!
>>> The caption says, <<<
An engineer will be assigned to the project.
>>>  The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
Ant farms!  Do it!
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> The caption says, <<<
The engineer will challenge the assumptions.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
You can't get a gallon of milk from an ant!
>>>  The Boss asks, <<<
What do YOU know about marketing?
>>> The caption says, <<<
Result: the engineer will never leave the company.

So . . . Your current job is 'Ant Farm Engineer'?

I'm doomed.
>>> 
1995-08-12 * 
Dilbert hands a document to the Boss, who is seated at his desk.  Dilbert says, <<<
As you requested, I dropped everything and wrote my career development plan.
>>> The Boss reads from the plan, <<<
I plan to bounce from one artificial emergency to another, like a ping-pong ball in a clothes dryer, until one day I resign.

Here I'm using humor to make a point . . .
>>>  The Boss yells, <<<
Fax this to HR now!!

1995-08-11 * 
The Boss, Wally, Alice and Dilbert sit around a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I'm reorganizing the department into fast-moving teams.

Good plan.  We'll never realize we're powerless, micro-managed serfs after we call ourselves a 'team.'
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
I need some less experienced people.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I feel faster already.

The G-forces are killing me".

The Boss stands in front of a conference table with an overhead projector on it.  He points to a diagram and says, <<<
My plan is to make you a self-directed team.
>>> Alice, Dilbert and Wally are at the table.  The Boss continues, <<<
After a few team meetings, the disrespect you have for each other will fester and grow into full-blown loathing.
>>> The Boss adds, <<<
You'll BEG me to micro-manage you!!  Ha ha ha!!
>>>  Wally comments, <<<
It actually feels good to have a plan.
>>> 
1995-08-09 * 
Alice walks past Wally's cubicle.  Wally says, <<<
Well, it wouldn't be Friday if I didn't see Alice wearing her one pair of tan pants.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
I love the 'business casual' look for the way it combines unattractive with unprofessional while diminishing neither.
>>> Alice responds, <<<
Do you think the fashion opinion of a male engineer matters to me??
>>>  Dilbert enters wearing the same print shirt and pants as Alice.  Dilbert yells, <<<
Twins!
>>> 
1995-08-08 * 
Alice stands in front of Catbert's desk.  Alice says, <<<
I don't understand your new dress code policy, Mr. Catbert.
>>>  Catbert replies, <<<
Maybe you're insane.
>>> Catbert continues, <<<
It's simple.  Fridays are 'casual.'  But you can't wear blue jeans because jeans look good and feel good and you already own several pairs.
>>> Alice replies angrily, <<<
It's another sadistic human resources plot to make people quit!!
>>>  Catbert answers, <<<
Say hello to unsightly panty lines.
>>> 
1995-08-07 * 
Catbert is at his desk.  He thinks, <<<
I think I'll invent some illogical policies to annoy employees.
>>> Catbert continues thinking, <<<
My diabolical new dress code will make them question their own sanity.
>>> Reading a document, Dilbert tells Wally, <<<
. . . So, casual clothes DON'T lower our stock value . . . but only if worn on Fridays . . . unless somebody sees us . . . Got it?
>>>  Wally puts his hands on his head and replies, <<<
I think I'm insane.
>>> 
1995-08-06 * 
Dilbert lies on a couch in a psychiatrist's office.  The therapist asks, <<<
When did you start believing that your boss was an evil entity from another dimension?
>>> Dilbert imagines the Boss telling him, <<<
I'd like to sit in on your customer meeting.
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> The Boss, Dilbert and a woman sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Let me share the high level strategic view.
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Here we go.
>>> The Boss spreads his arms and says, <<<
Life began in the primordial stew literally hundreds of years ago . . .
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
But we are the only company who ever found synergies in our win-win solutions!
>>> The caption says, <<<
Two hours later.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
And we won't sop until we delight every customer!

I'd be delighted if you just told me about your new Internet access product.

I cancelled the funding yesterday.

How's this?

That's peripheral vision!!!

1995-08-04 * 
Ratbert is in his box.  He thinks, <<<
This is really testing my sense of self-worth.
>>> Ratbert continues thinking, <<<
I will compensate by shouting a list of my talents to anybody who walks past.
>>> Dilbert is standing next to Wally.  Dilbert says, <<<
Ignore him.  He's trying to trick us into making eye contact.

I eat rubber! I carry disease! I enjoy opera!

1995-08-03 * 
Dilbert says to Ratbert, <<<
Congratulations on getting hired as a temp, Ratbert.
>>>  Ratbert answers, <<<
Where do I start?!
>>> Dilbert tells him, <<<
Your office is this cardboard box in the main hallway.  The regular employees will not make eye contact or ask your name.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Your status is roughly between the security guard and the crud behind the refrigerator.
>>>  Ratbert replies, <<<
Do I get a company car?
>>> 
1995-08-02 * 
Ratbert sits in a chair facing a desk.  Ratbert says, <<<
I submit myself as a candidate for the position of 'temporary employee.'
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
I'm VERY temporary.  First I'll be in one place and then you blink and I'm gone!  Blink, gone, blink, gone, blink, gone . . .
>>> The person behind the desk says, <<<
Stop saying 'Blink, gone.'  It's making me nuts.
>>>  Ratbert replies, <<<
It appears that the balance of power has shifted my way.

Dilbert sits at his desk.  Ratbert stands on the desk.  Dilbert says, <<<
We're planning to hire a temp at work.  You should apply for the job, Ratbert.
>>>  Ratbert replies, <<<
Wow! Me? A temp?!
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
As a temp I would finally get all of the respect and unconditional love that I deserve!!
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Danger: sharp learning curve ahead.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
I assume I'll get an office and a secretary.
>>> 
1995-07-31 * 
Dilbert sits in his cubicle and thinks to himself, <<<
I think, therefore I am.
>>> The Boss pokes his head into Dilbert's cubicle.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
But I'm micromanaged, therefore I am not.
>>> Back at home, Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I have a philosophical question for you.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
You're not me, therefore you're irrelevant.
>>> 
1995-07-30 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Wally stands behind him and says, <<<
Our new VP says he has an 'open door policy.'  Let's check it out.
>>> Wally and Dilbert peer into the VP's office.  Dilbert says, <<<
Knock knock.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Hi ho.  Nothing important.  We just wanted to drop in.
>>>  The VP sits at his desk reading a document. Wally says, <<<
This open door policy is great.  Our last VP was aloof.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Are those sourballs?
>>> Wally says, <<<
Look at the furniture in here!
>>>  Dilbert stuffs candy into his mouth and says, <<<
I call couch!
>>> The VP asks, <<<
Is there something I can do for you?
>>> Dilbert lies on a couch and says, <<<
Well . . . Sometimes our cubicles are too hot.
>>>  Wally sits in a chair and adds, <<<
Could you have somebody look into it?
>>> Dilbert and Wally leave the office looking frightened.  Dilbert says, <<<
Boy, those sourballs sure lull you into a false sense of security.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
The man is like a huge insincere spider.
>>> 
1995-07-29 * 
Wally is in Bob the Dinosaur's office.  Bob says, <<<
I'm afraid the equipment you want is not on the approved equipment list.
>>> Bob continues, <<<
Let me think . . . if I add this to the approved list, that's more work for ME . . . but if I say no, it's more work for YOU . . . hmm . . . think, think . . .
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'd like to see this alleged list.
>>>  Bob replies, <<<
Well, it's not so much a physical list as it is a philosophy.
>>> 
1995-07-28 * 
His boss in procurement explains to Bob the Dinosaur, <<<
Your duties are simple.  People will come to you and ask for things.
>>> Bob's boss continues, <<<
Assume all employees are lying, treasure-hunting thieves.  Give them low-cost substitutes and claim the savings on your accomplishments.
>>> An employee says to Bob, <<<
I asked for a multimedia laptop PC.  This is a 'Dymo' labeler.
>>>  Bob responds, <<<
Nice try, Paul, if that's your real name.
>>> 
1995-07-27 * 
Bob the Dinosaur sits on Dilbert's couch with his head down.  Dilbert tells him, <<<
Bob, your self-esteem might improve if you got a job.
>>>  Bob replies, <<<
As what?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
There's an opening in our procurement department.  You'd be perfect.
>>>  Bob asks, <<<
What does procurement do?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Their job is to prevent us from getting the computers we want.
>>>  Bob asks, <<<
Can I hit people with my tail?
>>> 
1995-07-26 * 
The Boss, Wally and Dilbert sit around a conference table.  Wally hands the Boss a piece of paper and says, <<<
My proposed work plan for the year is to stress-test our product under severe network conditions.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
I will accomplish this by downloading large image files from the busiest servers on the net.
>>> As Wally and Dilbert walk away from the meeting, Wally comments, <<<
I was THIS close to making it my job to download naughty pictures.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
It's just as well; I would have had to kill you.
>>> 
1995-07-25 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk and faces Wally who is holding a cup of coffee.  Dilbert says to Wally, <<<
It's amazing how much we've changed since prehistoric times.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Our ancestors just sat around in caves, grunting and drawing on the wall.
>>>  Wally comments, <<<
Not very productive.
>>> Dilbert draws crude pictures on the blackboard in his cubicle.  He tells Wally, <<<
It was just this, all day long.
>>>  Wally answers, <<<
Mmm.  Yup.
>>> 
1995-07-24 * 
Wally, Alice and Dilbert sit around a conference table.  Wally says, <<<
As usual, the boss is late.  What do you want to do?
>>> Dilbert suggests, <<<
Let's practice making small talk.  It'll come in handy when we meet with marketing.
>>> Wally begins,  <<<
So, Alice, haven't we seen that outfit a LOT?
>>>  Dilbert leans back in his chair and says, <<<
This chair is springy.  Do you think they're all springy?
>>> 
1995-07-23 * 
Alice sits at her desk.  Wally enters and says, <<<
I had a few suggestions on your document, Alice.
>>> Wally bangs his head on her monitor.  Alice says, <<<
Thanks.
>>> The Boss approaches Alice's desk and says, <<<
I've made some upgrades to your document, Alice.
>>> Alice looks at the paper and says, <<<
That's just what it needed: a bunch of obtuse acronyms and jargon.
>>> Alice continues, <<<
Oooh, looky!  You've also made elegant multi-topic sentences out of my stubby clear ones!
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Thank you.  And put me down as the author since I'm the boss.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Maybe I should distribute little plastic statues of you with every copy.  How about that?
>>> Alice hands Dilbert a statue and a document and says, <<<
Here's your copy, here's your statue, don't ask.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Our quality is low, but at least we don't get credit.
>>> 
1995-07-22 * 
Liz is having tea with Dilbert and his mother.  Liz says, <<<
I can't believe your father has been lost at the mall since 1992!
>>> Liz continues, <<<
If my father or my husband were lost at the mall I'd be searching for him twenty-four hours a day!!
>>> Dilbert comments, <<<
We're waiting for a sale.
>>>  His mother says, <<<
You're a bit of a whiner, aren't you, dear?
>>> 
1995-07-21 * 
Dilbert and Liz are having tea with Dilbert's mother, who says, <<<
It's really different around here since we lost Dilbert's dad.
>>>  Liz asks, <<<
When did he die?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
He's not dead.  We lost him at the mall, Christmas of '92.
>>> Liz looks shocked and asks, <<<
Shouldn't you be looking for him?
>>>  Dilbert's mom replies, <<<
I said it's different, not worse.
>>> 
1995-07-20 * 
Ted is at his baby shower with Dilbert, Alice and Wally.  He has just opened a present and says, <<<
Oh look, it's a stapler . . .
>>> Ted continues, <<<
I can use this to take up the hem on the lovely handcrafted paper bag dress that Dilbert made.
>>> Looking at the stapler, Ted comments, <<<
It looks just like the one that disappeared from my cubicle this morning.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Except yours had staples.
>>> 
1995-07-19 * 
At lunch, Dilbert says to Wally, <<<
I don't know what kind of gift to buy for Ted's baby shower.
>>> Wally responds, <<<
Hand-crafted items are good.  Cut three holes in a paper bag and you've got a lovely baby dress.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
He might think I'm cheap.
>>>  Wally holds up the table's salt shaker and asks, <<<
Do you think the kid has a salt shaker yet?
>>> 
1995-07-18 * 
The Boss, Wally and Dilbert sit around a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
That's an interesting suggestion, Wally.  But if it's a good idea, why aren't other companies doing it?
>>> Waving his hands wildly, Wally yells angrily, <<<
Can you imagine in your WILDEST dreams that maybe, just MAYBE I had a good idea that nobody else thought of?!!
>>> The Boss comments, <<<
You must have seen it in a book.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Thanks for the confidence in my abilities.
>>>  Dilbert interjects, <<<
You read a book?
>>> 
1995-07-17 * 
Liz and Dilbert are seated beneath a tree reading books.  She asks him, <<<
What did you bring to read?
>>>  Dilbert responds, <<<
It's a book of tips for my new computer golf game.
>>> Liz comments, <<<
So . . . you're reading a book . . . about a computer simulation . . . of an activity that's ALMOST a sport . . .
>>> Liz continues, <<<
That's about as close as you can get to being a non-organic life form.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
This chapter is about driving the little cart.
>>> 
1995-07-16 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I've decided to make some changes to our corporate culture.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Let me guess what that means.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
We'll work longer hours without extra pay . . .
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Your management style will remain exactly the same because Lord knows there's no need for YOU to change.
>>> Dilbert adds, <<<
We'll start calling ourselves a 'team' so it doesn't seem like work!
>>> Alice covers her eyes and says, <<<
I predict there will be vapid slogans printed on notepads, and maybe some useless meetings.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
She's psychic!
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Is is just me or is the culture already changing?
>>>  Wally shouts, <<<
I feel it!  We're changing!
>>> Wally looks at the agenda and asks, <<<
What's next on the fad menu?
>>>  The Boss thinks, <<<
I wonder if it's too late to rule by fear.
>>> 
1995-07-15 * 
The Boss tells Dilbert, <<<
I want you to study our options for Project 'Zebra' and make a recommendation.
>>> Both the Boss and Dilbert think, <<<
Translation:  'Read my mind then recommend the option I've already decided on.'
>>> Dilbert answers, <<<
I'll get right on it!
>>>  He thinks, <<<
Translation:  'I am doomed.  I will go look for naughty pictures on the Internet instead.'
>>> 
1995-07-14 * 
The Boss says to his secretary who sits at her desk, <<<
Carol, the next time you order my business cards, spell out my full title:  'Director of Product Enhancements.'
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Don't use the acronym 'DOPE.'
>>> The secretary replies, <<<
I didn't know you were the Director of Product Enhancements.
>>> 
1995-07-13 * 
Dilbert and Stan from marketing sit at a conference table.  As he types on a laptop, Dilbert tells Stan, <<<
Okay, let's start by documenting your market requirements.
>>> Stan responds, <<<
No, let's start by you telling me all the things you can design.  Then I'll tell you which one I like.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Work can be very rewarding.  You should try it.
>>>  Stan points to Dilbert's portable PC and asks, <<<
What's that doohickey you have there?
>>> 
1995-07-12 * 
Dilbert sits at his computer.  Liz says to Dilbert, <<<
I think you like that computer more than you like me.
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
That's not true, Liz.  I do NOT like that computer more than I like you.
>>> Dilbert thinks to himself, <<<
Please, please don't ask about the laptop.
>>>  Liz asks, <<<
'That' computer?
>>> 
1995-07-11 * 
Dogbert, Alice, Wally and a man sit at a conference table.  Dogbert is wearing a bishop's miter and holding a scepter.  Dogbert announces, <<<
I am Saint Dogbert.  I have come to drive out the stale and overused jokes about the information superhighway.
>>> The man comments, <<<
Sometimes I feel like roadkill on the information superhighway!
>>> Dogbert knocks the man out with a blow to the head.  Dogbert faces the reader and says, <<<
Don't make me come over there!
>>> 
1995-07-10 * 
Stan in marketing works at his computer while Dilbert looks over his shoulder.  Dilbert says, <<<
Everybody in engineering uses this program I wrote.  I think marketing should turn it into a product.
>>>  Stan replies, <<<
I wouldn't buy this.
>>> Dilbert tells Stan, <<<
That's irrelevant because the target market would be engineers.
>>>  Stan says, <<<
Engineers think the same as marketeers.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
If that were true we'd be sitting in a cave trying to decide if rocks are edible.
>>>  Stan points to the computer and says, <<<
You know, you could keep recipes on this.
>>> 
1995-07-09 * 
Dilbert approaches the Boss and says, <<<
We desperately need another person on my project!
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
We're already over headcount.  Get a contract employee.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Okay, but they cost twice as much.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Plus we need to buy a computer.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Rent one.  We're over our capital budget.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Renting is expensive.  We'll go over our expense budget.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
I'll fire Wally.  That will free up some cash.
>>> Dilbert throws his arms up in frustration and says, <<<
Wally's on my project!
>>> Dilbert shouts, <<<
Forget it!  I'll just work sixteen hours a day!!
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
That worked out perfectly.  I think I might be a genius or something.
>>> The Boss sits at his desk and thinks, <<<
I wonder if I should have told him the project was cancelled last week.
>>> 
1995-07-08 * 
The Boss, Dilbert and Alice sit around a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I want us to have the same kind of teamwork as the Egyptians who built the pyramids!
>>> Alice comments, <<<
Some scholars believe the pyramids were built by slaves.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
But there's some doubt; that's all I'm shooting for.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I think THEY were guided by UFOs too.
>>> 
1995-07-07 * 
Dilbert sits on his couch and Dogbert perches on the backrest.  Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
Our new dress policy at work allows casual clothes on Fridays.
>>> Dogbert responds, <<<
That's good, because studies have shown that Fridays are the ONLY safe day to dress casually; any other day would cause a stock plunge.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Is it just me or is that policy stupid?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
That's not an 'or' question.
>>> 
1995-07-06 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I jokingly told Stan in marketing that I reprogrammed his DNA.  He's so gullible that he's actually changing!
>>> Dogbert suggests, <<<
You must use his gullibility to reverse the process.  Remember, his entire reality is shaped by unverified customer anecdotes.
>>> Dilbert tells Stan, <<<
I heard a rumor of a story of an alleged focus group where a quote taken out of context indicates you're not becoming a weasel.
>>>  Stan says, <<<
I'm not?!  Yipeee!
>>> 
1995-07-05 * 
As they walk down a corridor, Alice says to Dilbert, <<<
Maybe you shouldn't have told Stan you programmed his DNA through the LAN.
>>> Alice continues, <<<
Those marketing guys believe anything.  They even believe market research, for heaven's sake.
>>> As Stan approaches, Alice says, <<<
There's no telling what the power of suggestion might do.
>>>  Stan, whose facial features now resemble those of a weasel, says to Dilbert, <<<
Well, thank you very much.
>>> 
1995-07-04 * 
Dilbert and Wally are eating lunch.  Dilbert says, <<<
I told a guy in marketing that I programmed his computer to alter his DNA structure.
>>>  Wally laughs, <<<
Hee Hee.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
He thinks he'll turn into some kind of animal.
>>>  Wally suggests, <<<
Tell him you set it to 'weasel.'  It'll take longer to notice any change.
>>> The guy in marketing says to Alice, <<<
Tell me the truth, Alice, can Dilbert reprogram my DNA?
>>>  Alice responds, <<<
Yeah.  You marketing guys only have one helix.
>>> 
1995-07-03 * 
Dilbert sits at his computer.  An employee peers around the door of Dilbert's cubicle and says, <<<
Ha ha!  Now that the engineers must charge their time to marketing, we OWN you!
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
I'll just reprogram your computer through the LAN so its radiation will alter your DNA.
>>> The employee asks, <<<
Is that possible??!
>>>  Dilbert responds <<<
As far as you know.
>>> 
1995-07-02 * 
The Boss, a man, Alice, Wally, and Dilbert sit around a conference table.  The Boss points to the man and says, <<<
I'd like you all to meet our new co-op employee.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We don't pay him.  He works for free to gain valuable job experience.
>>> The Boss says to the man, <<<
I'm putting you in charge of the PTG project!
>>> The man says, <<<
Wow!  What is it?!!
>>> Alice replies, <<<
PTG stands for 'Paper Towel Guy.'
>>> Alice explains, <<<
If somebody spills coffee it's your job to throw your body on it before it reaches one of us.
>>> Alice spills a cup on the table and says, <<<
Oops.
>>> The man flies through the air, yelling, <<<
Fire in the hole!!!
>>> The man lies on top of the spill.  He asks, <<<
How'd I do?
>>> Alice says, Not so good, kid.  That was tea.
>>> 
1995-07-01 * 
The Boss says to Dogbert, <<<
We took your advice and formed business units within the company . . .
>>> As Wally and another employee fight with each other in the background, the Boss continues, <<<
Now we spend all of our time fighting with each other about who does what.
>>> The Boss asks Dogbert, <<<
What exactly did you mean when you said it would 'guarantee future business?'"  Dogbert says, <<<
Oh look - my contract just expired.
>>> 
1995-06-30 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss points to a diagram on an overhead projector and says, <<<
We're going to follow the advice of the Dogbert Consulting Company and form 'Battlin' Business Units.'
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
We'll spend most of our time cross-charging and undermining the other BBU's.
>>> Wally comments, <<<
A little competition is healthy.
>>>  The Boss adds, <<<
Whatever you do, DON'T tick off the janitorial BBU.
>>> 
1995-06-29 * 
Dogbert tells the Boss, <<<
One way to look at your problem is that nobody likes your products.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
But I don't know how to fix that.  So I recommend forming internal business units to bicker with each other.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Why would you recommend that?
>>>  Dogbert responds, <<<
Well, I'd be lying if I said I liked you.
>>> 
1995-06-28 * 
Alice points to a display created by a laptop and overhead projector.  She says, <<<
As you requested, I benchmarked our company against five world-class companies.
>>> Alice continues, <<<
The comparisons are irrelevant because we're in different industries.  But that didn't stop me.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Why can they make a potato chip in one second but it takes up months to develop software?
>>>  Alice answers, <<<
I think they oil the chips.
>>> 
1995-06-27 * 
The Boss says to Alice, <<<
Alice, I want you to benchmark these world-class companies.  Find out how we compare.
>>> Alice responds, <<<
I'm betting they don't make verbs out of nouns.  And I'll bet they don't assign engineers to do field research.
>>> Alice talks on the phone in her office.  She asks, <<<
Do you guys have any pointy-haired idiots running your place? . . . Would you like one?
>>> 
1995-06-26 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I asked Saint Dogbert to mediate our dispute over what kind of computers are allowed here.
>>> Dogbert stands behind him wearing a miter and holding a scepter. Looking down from the top of a file cabinet, Dogbert raises his arms and says, <<<
I shall go to the desert and seek enlightenment.  When I return I will reveal the true path of computing.
>>> The caption says, <<<
Palm Springs.
>>>  Dogbert is at a table with a man holding a suitcase full of money.  Behind the man is a woman with a sack of money.  Dogbert says to the man, <<<
You call this an endorsement contract?!  Go to the end of the line!
>>> 
1995-06-25 * 
The Boss, Dilbert and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss hands Alice a paper and says, <<<
Take care of this, Alice.
>>> Alice says, <<<
'Take care of this'?  This would double my workload.
>>> Alice says, <<<
I've already got so many projects that I can't do anything useful with any of them.
>>> Alive continues, <<<
But if success is impossible then . . . I'm . . free  . .
>>> Alice laughs and shouts, <<<
Free!  Free!
>>> Alice sings, <<<
The result will be the same no matter what I do!  Yes yes yes.
>>> Alice grabs the Boss's hair and says, <<<
Honk honk!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Moving along . . . We need to inventory our office equipment.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Sounds like a job for Alice.
>>> 
1995-06-24 * 
Wally approaches another employee and says, <<<
Hold it right there, buddy.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
That scruffy beard . . . those suspenders . . . that smug expression . . .
>>> Wally concludes, <<<
You're one of those condescending Unix computer users!
>>>  The man responds, <<<
Here'a nickel, kid.  Get yourself a better computer.
>>> 
1995-06-23 * 
Wally is in Catbert's office.  Wally says, <<<
Mister Catbert, the company is trying to force me to use a different kind of computer.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
You're the Human Resources Director.  What are you doing to stop this religious persecution??!  What ever happened to 'diversity??'
>>> Catbert responds, <<<
The longer you verk here, diverse it gets . . . Next.
>>> 
1995-06-22 * 
Ratbert, the Boss and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  Ratbert says, <<<
I recommend standardizing on one type of computer for the office.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
We must identify and eliminate the deviant users of Macintosh, Unix and . . . God help us . . . OS/2 Warp.
>>>  Dilbert glares at him. The caption reads, <<<
The Holy Wars Begin.
>>>  Ratbert interrogates a man being held by police.  Ratbert says, <<<
Don't lie to me, Gustav!  You're a stinkin' Mac user!!
>>> 
1995-06-21 * 
Ratbert is seated at a table with Dilbert.  Ratbert says, <<<
The finance department has analyzed your computing needs and decided to give you a 286 PC.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
That should be sufficient for the 3D-rendering you need to do.
>>> Ratbert continues,  <<<
Besides, how many times are you going to do 3D-rendering in your career?
>>>  Dilbert responds, <<<
Once, if I hurry.
>>> 
1995-06-20 * 
Ratbert stands behind Wally's desk and says, <<<
I'm from the finance department.  I'm here to reduce costs.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
It might seem like all I do is come up with short-sighted ways to save money while making your job harder.  But there's another side to this story.
>>> Wally asks, <<<
And that would be . . . ?
>>>  Ratbert answers, <<<
I forget.
>>> 
1995-06-19 * 
Ratbert stands on Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
I've been hired by the finance department to help cut spending.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
I'll be studying your every move and looking for waste and inefficiency.
>>> Looking over Dilbert's shoulder at his monitor, Ratbert says, <<<
Those words in boldface look like they're sucking up the ol' electricity.
>>> 
1995-06-18 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk next to Dogbert.  Ratbert enters and says, <<<
I've been invited to be a guest on 'Crossfire' on CNN.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
I'm the only creature on earth who hasn't already been on television.
>>> Ratbert asks, <<<
Can you teach me how to debate on television, Dogbert?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Okay.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
First, Ratbert, assume everybody has the same desires and experiences as you.
>>>  Ratbert touches his head and says, <<<
Absorb absorb.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Therefore, if they disagree with you they must be stupid.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I think you're over-simplifying, Dogbert.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
What was that opinion, Ratbert?
>>>  Ratbert replies, <<<
Stupid!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You're ready for 'Crossfire,' Ratbert.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
I usually like the same movies as the fat one.
>>> 
1995-06-17 * 
The Boss looks into Dilbert's cubicle and says, <<<
I see signs of productivity here.  I'm moving you to another cubicle.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Your phone and computer will be disconnected for weeks.  Your files will be boxed and lost.
>>> Dilbert's hair stands on end as he says, <<<
Good Lord, you've abandoned all pretense of being on our side!!
>>>  The Boss responds, <<<
Loser.
>>> 
1995-06-16 * 
Ratbert says to Bob the Dinosaur, <<<
My new goal, Bob, is to be the next heavyweight boxing champion of the world!!
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
Don't let anybody ever tell you that you're too small or too slow or too uncoordinated.
>>> Bob interjects, <<<
Or too clueless.
>>>  Ratbert responds, <<<
Exactly!  Now you're catching on.
>>> 
1995-06-15 * 
Dilbert and Wally are in the copier room.  Dilbert stands behind Wally thinking, <<<
Lacking clerical support, the highly trained, highly paid professionals line up at the copier.
>>> Dilbert continues thinking, <<<
Their amazing analytical skills are squandered in this mindless task.
>>> Wally says, <<<
No . . . It looks like the 'toner' light doesn't turn off if you wait.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Let's give it another five minutes.
>>> 
1995-06-14 * 
Dilbert is in the Boss's office.  The Boss says, <<<
Great news!  I've reengineered your job to make you more fulfilled!
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
You'll no longer be limited to one little part of the value chain.  You'll be involved in all stages of production!
>>> Dilbert covers his eyes and says, <<<
Oh Lord, you fired all the secretaries!!
>>>  The Boss orders, <<<
Dust my credenza.
>>> 
1995-06-13 * 
Wally sits in his cubicle talking on the phone.  He says, <<<
Hello, is this the mountain resort where all our executives are having a retreat?
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Is is true that loud noises can cause avalanches?
>>>  Wally continues, <<<
If you see my boss, tell him I said . . .
>>> Wally screams into the phone, <<<
HI!!
>>> 
1995-06-12 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, Wally and Alice, <<<
Have fun working.  I'm off to the two-week management retreat in the mountains.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It's so sad you can't come.  I guess there isn't room at the four-star hotel.
>>> As he flees from books and folders being hurled at him, the Boss thinks, <<<
Now I know why it's called a retreat.
>>> 
1995-06-11 * 
An instructor stands at the front of a room and says, <<<
Let's go around the circle and share what we learned in the three-day workshop.
>>> Wally, Dilbert and Alice sit together.  Wally says, <<<
At first I thought it was a waste of our training budget . . .
>>> Wally says, <<<
Then you asked us to form teams and make paper airplanes while blindfolded . . .
>>> Wally turns to Dilbert and says, <<<
I don't know if it was because of the darkness or the way we shared our thoughts about flight . . .
>>> Wally says, <<<
But suddenly I found unconditional love for my co-workers.  Be they accountants, be they marketeers or be they secretaries.
>>> Wally stands on his chair and says, <<<
As a result, I've become a competitive lion, eager to pounce on my workload and increase stockholder values!!
>>> The instructor says, <<<
Thank you, Wally.  Dilbert, what did you learn?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I learned that you shouldn't put a little eraser-pilot in your paper airplane.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Somebody needs a group hug.
>>> 
1995-06-10 * 
Wally stands in front of the Boss's desk.  Wally demands, <<<
You've got to increase the budget for training!
>>> The Boss responds, <<<
If I train you, then wouldn't you just leave the company to make more money working for our competitor?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I guess there is a downside.
>>>  The Boss asks, <<<
And the downside would be . . . ?
>>> 
1995-06-09 * 
Dogbert, Dilbert, Alice and the Boss sit at a round table.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'd like each of you to tell the team what you learned in my workshop.
>>> Alice says, <<<
I learned to listen with my heart.  I gained respect for others.  I understand Sanskrit.  I got my ham radio license.  I can divide by zero . . .
>>> As the Boss looks shocked, Alice thinks to herself, <<<
I love going first.
>>> 
1995-06-08 * 
Dogbert, Dilbert, Alice, Wally and the Boss sit at a round table.  Dogbert says, <<<
In this team-building exercise you will make paper dolls while blindfolded.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
This may seem absurd.  But soon, cognitive dissonance will set in and you'll cry and hug and think you learned something.
>>> The members of the group, now blindfolded and working with scissors, begin their work.  As he is about to cut his hand with the scissors, Dilbert asks, <<<
Are you sure we'll cry and hug?
>>>  Dogbert answers, <<<
Actually, hugging is iffy.
>>> 
1995-06-07 * 
The Boss, Dogbert, Dilbert, Alice and Wally sit at a round table.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'd like everybody to turn to the right and say what you admire about that person.
>>> The Boss turns to Alice, who is on his left, and says, <<<
I admire your leathery skin, Alice.
>>>  Alice responds, <<<
I admire your ability to figure out which side is your RIGHT in only two tries.
>>> Dilbert faces Dogbert on his right and says, <<<
I admire your ability to get paid for this.
>>>  Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
Despite the fact your face scares children, I admire your co-workers.
>>> 
1995-06-06 * 
The Boss, Wally, Dilbert, Dogbert and Alice sit around a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I hired renowned psychologist Dogbert to help us achieve peak performance in teamwork.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Peak performance is somewhat relative.  You're a highly dysfunctional team, so we must set realistic goals.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
What would be a realistic goal for us?
>>>  Dogbert answers, <<<
I think I can postpone cannibalism.
>>> 
1995-06-05 * 
Wally sits in a chair across from a manager's desk.  The manager asks, <<<
Why do you want to transfer to my department, Wally?
>>> Wally responds, <<<
I'm in a dysfunctional organization.  I'm not getting the love and support I need.  That's why I've been making long-distance personal calls from the fax room.
>>> The manager says, <<<
Your resume says every boss you've had was a complete jerk.
>>>  Wally responds, <<<
So, when do I start?
>>> 
1995-06-04 * 
Wally and Dilbert at a conference table with a vendor.  Dilbert looks at a product and says, <<<
Your company makes an attractive little product, Jim.
>>> Dilbert hands the unit back to Jim.  Dilbert says, <<<
But we've decided to go with a vendor whose product actually works.
>>> Jim stands up suddenly, causing Dilbert's tie to fly straight up.  Jim screams, <<<
Fools!!!  I'll crush you!!!
>>> Jim continues, <<<
I'll tell your boss you made a stupid decision!!  Your careers will be ruined and I'll get the contract anyway!!
>>> Wally says, <<<
You can't scare us!  Do you think our boss will believe a vendor over his own loyal employees?
>>> Wally and Dilbert cross their arms and think, <<<
Must . . . keep . . . a . . . straight . . . face . . .
>>> Wally, Dilbert and Jim erupt in laughter. Dilbert says, <<<
We'll take a million units.
>>>  Jim says, <<<
Take two million and I'll see that you get nice raises.
>>> 
1995-06-03 * 
An employee from the finance department stands beside an overhead projector, giving a presentation to Dilbert and Alice.  The man says, <<<
Here's your latest budget cuts.  But please don't kill the messenger from finance, ha ha!!
>>> The man continues, <<<
I recommended a 20&#037; cut.  A quick glance around the room tells me you're not on the success vector anyhoo, so nothing lost.
>>> The finance employee hangs out the window, tied up in the overhead projector's power cord.  He says, <<<
Tough room.
>>> 
1995-06-02 * 
Dilbert sees Wally wearing a hat with a triangular flag or pennant attached.  Dilbert asks, <<<
What's the hat for, Wally?
>>>  Wally answers, <<<
It's a new safety rule.  I think it's stupid.
>>> Wally says, <<<
The e-mail from human resources said all short employees must wear these to improve visibility while in the cubicle aisles.
>>> Dilbert peers into Alice's cubicle.  He says to her, <<<
HR should change their password once in a while.
>>>  Alice says, <<<
I'll bet we can make him wear aluminum foil pants.
>>> 
1995-06-01 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at a table.  Dilbert says, <<<
My cellular phone and laptop computer allow me to work any time and anyplace . . .
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
While driving?
>>>  Dilbert answers, <<<
Too dangerous.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
In restaurants?
>>>  Dilbert answers, <<<
Too rude.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Outdoors?
>>>  Dilbert answers, <<<
Nope.
>>> Dogbert concludes, <<<
Basically, you lug them around and worry that they'll get stolen or broken.
>>>  Dilbert fondles his laptop and says, <<<
Stop it.  You're scaring them.
>>> 
1995-05-31 * 
The Boss stands in the door of Dilbert's cubicle.  The Boss notices a small doll on Dilbert's monitor and says, <<<
Hey!  That little stuffed doll looks just like me!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It gives me an emotional lift to have your likeness nearby.
>>> The Boss walks away smiling and thinking, <<<
I never realized what he thought of me.
>>>  Inside his cubicle Dilbert whacks the doll off the monitor and thinks, <<<
Stop dropping in like that!!
>>> 
1995-05-30 * 
The Boss asks Dilbert, <<<
Have you taken the mandatory training for business ethics?
>>> Dilbert answers, <<<
No.  But if you SAY I did then you'll save some money on training which you can spend to decorate your office.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Luckily, I haven't taken the training myself.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I hear it's mostly common sense anyway.
>>> 
1995-05-29 * 
Dilbert sits at his computer.  The Boss enters and says, <<<
I've decided to be more of a hands-on manager.
>>> The Boss stands behind Dilbert and yells, <<<
Move the mouse . . . Up . . . Up . . . Over . . . More . . . Now click it!!  Click it!!
>>> The Boss raises his arms over his head and screams, <<<
No!!!  You fool!!!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
This has 'long day' written all over it.
>>> 
1995-05-28 * 
The Boss enters Dilbert's cubicle and says, <<<
I'm putting you in charge of project 'BIFF.'
>>> The Boss says <<<
'BIFF' stands for 'Big Improvements For Free.'
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Your job is to recommend ways to increase profits without spending money or changing anything.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You have to spend money to make money.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
If we HAD money to spend we wouldn't need to MAKE money.  Duh.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The point is that you can make MORE money than you spend.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'm not following your so-called 'point.'
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Logically, anything I don't understand is unimportant.  Have your report tomorrow.
>>> The Boss sits at his desk, holding Dilbert's report.  The Boss says, <<<
So, you recommend . . . Replacing all managers with lava lamps.
>>>  Dilbert reaches into his pocket and says, <<<
Here's a few bucks for the lava lamps.
>>> 
1995-05-27 * 
In a dream, Dilbert flies through the sky.  He thinks, <<<
In my dream I float over fields of heather.
>>>  Below him a girl waves and says, <<<
Hi!  I'm Heather.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
The flying dream always predicts an important change.  I feel that my freedom will soon increase.
>>> Dilbert wakes up in a meeting as the Boss asks, <<<
Does somebody else have a question for our new CEO?
>>>  Dilbert's arms are out-streched and his finger is stuck in the CEO's ear.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
My finger is stuck.
>>> 
1995-05-26 * 
Dogbert says to Dilbert, <<<
You must learn to use your boss's ignorance to your advantage.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Find out what impresses him and list it on your accomplishments.
>>> Dilbert sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss reads a document and says, <<<
You're the actor in the 'Barney' suit?!!  I love that guy!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Don't tell anybody my secret identity.
>>> 
1995-05-25 * 
Dogbert sits in Dilbert's office with a laptop balanced on his lap.  He says to Dilbert, <<<
Tell me your greatest accomplishments at work.  I'll use that to hype you up with your boss so you get a big raise.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I wrote a draft of a white paper on a strawman process to reengineer our product process.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
And what was the impact of that work?
>>>  Dilbert answers, I think some owls lost their woodland habitats.
>>> 
1995-05-24 * 
Dogbert hands Dilbert the phone and says, <<<
You can create the illusion that you work long hours by leaving voice mails for your boss at 4 a.m.
>>> Dilbert says into the phone, <<<
Hi, this is Dilbert.  It's 4 a.m. and I'm in my underwear and I thought of you . . .Oops . . . Erase . . . Oops . . .
>>>  As he presses the buttons on the phone it makes beeping noises.  Dogbert's ears stand up in astonishment. Dogbert asks, <<<
Did you just send an obscene message to your boss?
>>>  Dilbert looks at the phone and says, <<<
No . . . I think I hit the group code.
>>> 
1995-05-23 * 
Dilbert says to the Boss, <<<
My salary depends on your opinion of my work.  But you have no interest in understanding what I do, so . . .
>>> Dogbert enters carrying a briefcase.  Dilbert gestures toward him and says, <<<
I hired the Dogbert Public Relations Firm to hype my performance and get me a big raise.
>>> Dogbert hands the Boss a document and says, <<<
Press release: engineer cures cancer while saving baby from burning building.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
That's not in his objectives.
>>> 
1995-05-22 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Our policy is to employ only the BEST technical professionals.
>>>  Dilbert raises his hand and says, <<<
Question.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Isn't it also our policy to base salaries on the 'industry AVERAGE?'
>>> The Boss answers, <<<
Right.  We like them bright but clueless.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I feel sorry for people like that.
>>> 
1995-05-21 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk. The Boss hands him a paper and says, <<<
Here's the company vision and business plan.
>>> Dilbert reads, <<<
'Vision: Empowered employees working toward a common plan.'  Sounds good.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But the business plan is blank.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
It's confidential.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How am I supposed to know what to do?
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
I'll yell at you if you do the wrong thing.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I thought I was empowered.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Don't be so literal.
>>> Dilbert turns around and says, <<<
I'll just keep doing what I was doing.
>>> The Boss screams, <<<
No!!!  You fool!!!
>>> Dilbert faces the reader. Dilbert asks, <<<
We're doomed, aren't we?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I don't know.  I haven't seen the plan.
>>> 
1995-05-20 * 
Dilbert peers out of his cubicle and says to the Boss as he walks by, <<<
You never answered my e-mail.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
My secretary is out, so there's nobody to print my e-mail for me.  Bring me your message on hardcopy.
>>> Dilbert enters the Boss's office holding a small pyramid and says, <<<
I was out of papyrus so I chiseled my message on a little pyramid.
>>>  The Boss thinks, <<<
Did he work alone or were UFOs involved?
>>> 
1995-05-19 * 
The Boss, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
We need to boost our return-on-assets ratio.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Let's eliminate the security department.  That would cut expenses while allowing for a brisk reduction in assets.
>>> As they walk away, Dilbert asks Wally, <<<
When are you planning to tell him you were joking?
>>>  Wally responds, <<<
After I furnish my den.
>>> 
1995-05-18 * 
Dilbert arrives at home and says to Dogbert, <<<
Today I distributed 36 copies of my business case to various managers for approval.
>>> Dilbert sits on the armrest of the couch and continues, <<<
By my count, 20 are being misplaced, 6 managers will try to kill it for personal gain and 10 will come back with irrelevant questions.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
When I die I want to be buried, not cremated, so I can at least make ONE lasting impression on the earth.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I was planning to mail your corpse to somebody I don't like.
>>> 
1995-05-17 * 
Dilbert approaches an office door with paper spilling out of it.  Dilbert says to Tom who is trapped in the stack of paper, <<<
I need your approval on my business case, Tom.
>>> As he inserts his document into the stack, Dilbert says, <<<
I'll wedge it in here so you can claim you never saw it when I ask about it next week.
>>>  From underneath the pile Tom says, <<<
Thanks.
>>> Dilbert walks away humming and thinking, <<<
The weird part is that I can feel productive even when I'm doomed.
>>> 
1995-05-16 * 
Dilbert stands in front of a the Vice President of Marketing's desk.  The VP reads a document and says, <<<
I could give you marketing's approval right now . . .
>>> The VP continues, <<<
Or I could flex my vice presidential power and send you to gather more useless data . . . My ego would expand and I'd be a major stallion with my wife tonight.
>>> The VP asks Dilbert, <<<
Do you think you can top that?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Ill try, sir.  What's your wife's address?
>>> 
1995-05-15 * 
Dilbert asks the Boss, <<<
Who needs to sign my business case to buy a web server?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Hmm . . . This crosses all departments.  I fear it.  Get the approval of every director, every VP, every EVP, plus Griffin.
>>> As Dilbert walks away he asks, <<<
Do you mean Ted Griffin in finance or the mythical griffin beast that's half eagle, half lion?
>>>  The Boss answers, <<<
Whichever is harder.
>>> 
1995-05-14 * 
The Boss tells Alice, Wally and Dilbert, <<<
Write up your accomplishments so I can decide who gets raises this year.
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Are you saying our raises will depend on our ability to lie about our achievements?
>>> The Boss replies as he walks away, <<<
No, there's also favoritism.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
And don't forget the importance of minimizing the accomplishments of others.
>>> Dilbert sits at his desk and types, <<<
This year I saved a billion dollars in ways which are impossible to verify.
>>> Wally types, <<<
While the others plotted against you, I was applying an invisible rust inhibitor to your car.
>>> Alice says to Wally and Dilbert, <<<
I can drop those off for you.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Thanks.
>>> Dilbert asks Wally, <<<
Have you noticed she's the only one who ever gets a raise?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
It's as if she has the accomplishments of three people.
>>> 
1995-05-13 * 
Dogbert sits on his pillow.  Ratbert approaches him with a notebook and pen and says, <<<
I'm going to interview successful people and write a book of their tips.  I'll start with you, Dogbert.
>>> Ratbert writes in his notebook as Dogbert says, <<<
Set your alarm clock to go off every hour.  Keep a big vat of 'Jell-O' by the bed.  When the alarm goes off, stick our head in the 'Jell-O' and yell, 'Boy, I'm tired!'
>>> Ratbert walks away saying, <<<
Thanks!
>>>  Dogbert thinks, <<<
Beware the advice of successful people; they do not seek company.
>>> 
1995-05-12 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, Alice and their co-workers, <<<
Today we have a motivational speaker from the 'Discount Speakers Bureau.'
>>> A slouching, unhappy man says, <<<
You should, like, work harder . . . Otherwise you might get fired.  Any questions?
>>> Dilbert raises his hand and asks, <<<
Would we get bonuses for working harder?
>>>  The speaker says, <<<
This must be the slow class.
>>> 
1995-05-11 * 
Dilbert, Wally and another man sit at a table in a restaurant.  Dilbert looks at the check and says, <<<
We could simply divide the check by three . . .
>>>  The waitress thinks, <<<
Uh-oh.  Engineers.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But that would result in an unpopular subsidy of Wally's salmon.  Does anybody have a calculator-watch?
>>> The caption says, <<<
Hours later.
>>>  The other engineer says to the waitress as she approaches the table with a pitcher, <<<
This is the tie-breaker round of water to decide if you get 13&#037; or 13.5&#037;.
>>>  The waitress growls, <<<
RRRR.
>>> 
1995-05-10 * 
Dilbert reads an e-mail message on his computer screen.  The message says, <<<
To: all users.  From: network admin.  Please refrain from frivolous e-mail.  It bogs down the network.
>>> Dilbert types a message that says, <<<
To: network admin.
>>> From: <<<
Dilbert.  CC: all users.  I agree!
>>> Dilbert arrives at home and asks Dogbert, <<<
Have you noticed there's too much communication in the world, Dogbert?

Yeah, every day at about this time.
>>> 
1995-05-09 *

I'm so lucky to be dating you, Liz.  You're at least an eight.
>>>  Liz responds, <<<
You're a ten.
>>> Dilbert and Liz sit looking at the mountains in silence. Dilbert asks, <<<
Are we using the same scale?
>>>  Liz responds, <<<
Ten is the number of seconds it would take to replace you.
>>> 
1995-05-08 * 
The Boss stands in the door of Dilbert's cubicle and asks, <<<
Why is everybody putting signs on their cubicles?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
We thought it would be classy to name our cubicles the same way we name conference rooms.
>>> The Boss reads signs that say <<<
O.J. Room" and <<<
Menendez Rooms" and thinks, <<<
I know there's a catch . . . But what?

>>> The caption says, <<<
2. Use humor to belittle people in public.
>>>  The Boss puts his arm around a man and tells Wally, <<<
Our newest team member has movie star looks.  Specifically, Lassie.
>>>  Wally laughs. The caption says, <<<
3. Treat all complaints as the complainer's fault.

You don't motivate me.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Maybe you should see a therapist.
>>> The caption says, <<<
4. Show up late and raise controversial issues.

Ooh, nice crisp photocopy, Alice.  I don't think a man could have done it better!

Hee hee!  Look at the hair on that guy!

My hobby is geography.  Would you sign my book to each of the continents by name?
>>> Dogbert says to the man, <<<
Are you aware that my book recommends a twirling wedgie for people who ask for too much?
>>>  A hand reaches toward the man. Bob the Dinosaur twirls the man over his head as he gives him a wedgie.  Bob says, <<<
We find the line moves faster if I do this to the first customer.
>>> 
1995-05-04 * 
Dogbert sits on his pillow thinking, <<<

Who irons corn anyway?
>>> 
1995-05-03 * 
Dogbert sits in a radio DJ booth wearing headphones and speaking into a microphone.  He says, <<<
Today we're talking about sex after marriage.  Many liberals support this depraved practice but I do not.

It can lead to headaches, fatigue and unwanted family members who become consultants.

Wouldn't your philosophy lead to the extinction of mankind?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Cry me a river, Liberal.

I'm the smartest creature in the universe and you are all dolts.

I think the best way to pursue my goal of world domination is to become a talk radio host.

Like that one?

Oh no.

Well . . . I was just sending an e-mail to somebody who sits by a window to ask if it's raining.

If it's raining I'll fashion a raincoat from a large trash bag.  Watch.

Three holes and you're ready to go!

Are you planning to go out at lunch?

Only if it rains.

I'm planning to turn the house into a gambling casino.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Isn't that illegal?

Not in the tiny republic of Dogbertland.  I seceded from the repressive homeland this morning.

Yes!!!  Our opinions mattered!

Actually it's because the prisoners complained.

I wonder what he plans to do with spare cubicles now.

A man with a shaved head peers over the wall into Dilbert's cubicle and asks, <<<
Hey, buddy, what are you in for?

Unlike yourself, I am not a prisoner here.  I CHOOSE to work here of my own free will!

>>>  The prisoner says, <<<
Great . . . I'm in the freak section.
>>> 
1995-04-25 * 
Dogbert stands in Dilbert's cubicle wearing a hard hat and reading some construction plans.  Dilbert says, <<<
I don't think it's fair to put convicts in our spare cubicles.

I think there are a few differences!
>>>  Dogbert responds, <<<
Yeah, their health plan is better.
>>> 
1995-04-24 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
We've got a lot of empty cubicles because of downsizing.

I hired the Dogbert Construction Company to convert part of the office into prison cells which we'll lease to the state.

Sounds like a big job.
>>>  Dogbert responds, <<<
Nah.  A little paint, new carpet and we're there.

1995-04-23 * 
A man tells Dilbert, <<<
You'll be performing a 'Turing test' on our new artificial intelligence software.
>>> Dilbert sits at a desk.  The researcher continues, <<<
Try to determine if the responses on your screen come from our computer or a human in the next room.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll ask it to write a strategy for our company.
>>> The computer responds, <<<
Our strategy is to visionize quality resources that enhance earnings.
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Hmm.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll ask it how to motivate employees.
>>> The computer response says, <<<
Reorganize often to improve focus.  Redefine work as 'opportunity' and increase it daily.  Take time to ask for opinions then explain why they're wrong.
>>> Dilbert tells the researcher, <<<
It must be a computer because there's no human intelligence.  Unless . . .
>>> Dilbert looks into the next room and sees the Boss sitting at a computer.  Dilbert says, <<<
Nice try, boss.
>>> 
1995-04-22 * 
Dilbert sits in his cubicle holding the phone.  The voice on the phone says, <<<
To hear your urgent voice mail message press one . . . 
>>> A voice on the phone says, <<<
This urgent message is to all employees.  Please disregard the rumors of a merger with a healthy company.
>>> Dilbert looks out of his cubicle and sees co-workers running in every direction.  One man yells, <<<
Resume!
>>>  Another cries, <<<
Where's my interview suit??!!
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Now spooked, the herd stampedes.
>>> 
1995-04-21 * 
Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
Allow me to introduce Loud Howard.
>>>  Howard, a man with a huge mouth, shouts, <<<
Hi!
>>> Wally says, <<<
I will make Loud Howard your cubicle neighbor in the new office unless you give me your immortal soul!!
>>>  Howard shouts, <<<
Nice day!
>>> Back at home, Dilbert and Dogbert lie on the couch.  Dilbert says, <<<
. . . Fortunately I convinced him to take my laser printer instead . . .
>>>  Trying to read a book, Dogbert says, <<<
What did I say that sounded like 'Tell me about your day?'
>>> 
1995-04-20 * 
Wally stands behind Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
We're moving to a new office across town.  I volunteered to coordinate the move.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
I control your cubicle assignment.  Nay, your very existence.  From now on you will refer to me as 'Lord Wally the Puppet Master.'
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I don't think it's legal to enjoy your work this much.
>>>  Wally waves his hands and says, <<<
I banish you to the cubicle closest to your boss!!
>>> 
1995-04-19 * 
Dogbert says to a prospective client, <<<
Here's a picture of you living in a dumpster in twenty years.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
But if you invest in the 'Dogbert Deferred Income Fund' take a look at what you could own someday!!
>>> The client says, <<<
I could own a mansion?!!
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
You could own a photograph.
>>> 
1995-04-18 * 
A prospective client sits across from Dogbert's desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
Stocks . . . annuities . . . derivatives . . . capital gains tax . . .
>>> Dogbert shouts, <<<
It's all too confusing for you!!  Give me all your money now or you'll die a pauper!!  Now!  Now!!  Before interest rates fall!! As he signs a document, the client says, <<<
Will this reduce my income taxes?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
More than you might guess.
>>> 
1995-04-17 * 
Dilbert sits on a pillow on the floor working on his laptop.  Dogbert tells him, <<<
I'm going into business as a financial advisor.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Sounds hard.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
It's easy.  I'll tell all my clients to invest in the 'Dogbert Deferred Earnings Fund.'
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Isn't that a conflict of interest?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Only if I show interest in the client.
>>> 
1995-04-16 * 
Dilbert walks down the hall wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase.  Wally says, <<<
Looks like somebody has a job interview.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Shh.
>>> Dilbert sits across from a desk.  The interviewer says, <<<
Your resume is impressive.  I only have one question.
>>> The interviewer asks, <<<
What do you consider your biggest fault?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Sometimes I work too hard.
>>>  He thinks to himself, <<<
Good one.
>>> The interviewer asks, <<<
Why is that a fault?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Well . . . Uh . . . I work so hard that I forget to eat and bathe for days.  Eventually I starve to death at my desk.
>>> Dilbert lies down on the chair and continues, <<<
I become a bloated, stinking corpse.  Insects breed in my body.  I spread disease to the entire company.
>>> Wally asks Dilbert, <<<
How did it go?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
They want somebody hungrier.
>>> 
1995-04-15 * 
The Boss stands in front of a camera and Dogbert sits in a director's chair.  Dogbert hands the Boss a script and says, <<<
Stick to the script.  Act sincere and beg your customers to forgive you.
>>> The Boss looks into the camera and reads, <<<
It was wrong for us to sell keyboards with no 'Q.'  We're sorry.  We're morons.
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert sit on the couch watching the Boss's television commercial.  In the advertisement, the Boss says, <<<
We're dumber than squirrels.  We hear voices and do what they command.  I have broccoli in my socks.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Good writing.
>>>  Dogbert responds, <<<
Thanks.
>>> 
1995-04-14 * 
Dogbert, the Boss and Dilbert sit around a conference table.  Dogbert says, <<<
You shipped keyboards with no letter 'Q.'  The public wants somebody to take responsibility.
>>> The Boss raises both arms and shouts, <<<
Ooh ooh, pick me, pick me!!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Responsibility means blame.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Great . . . It's like the time I got burned on that 'opportunity' assignment.
>>> 
1995-04-13 * 
Dogbert, Wally and Dilbert sit around a conference table.  Dogbert says, <<<
You could offer free replacements for all the keyboards you sold without a 'Q,' or you could blame the media for blowing it out of proportion.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Let's blame the media.  They'll admit they were wrong and the whole thing will disappear.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You have a brilliant grasp of human nature, Wally.
>>>  Wally responds, <<<
I know.  My third wife always said the same thing.
>>> 
1995-04-12 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk, reading a newspaper.  Dilbert says, <<<
The pundits in the press are nailing us for shipping a keyboard with no 'Q.'
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
It's a public-relations fiasco.  Obviously, we need an engineering solution.  I'm on the case.
>>> Dilbert and Wally sit at a table.  Dilbert says, <<<
Users could use a graphics program to draw a 'Q' in the unlikely event that they need one.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Or we could replace the semi-colon; nobody uses them.
>>> 
1995-04-11 * 
The Boss, Dilbert and a male employee sit around a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Okay, so we shipped a million keyboards that don't have the letter 'Q.'  What do we do?
>>> The man says, <<<
We could offer free upgrades to users who can prove they need a 'Q.'
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
How many users need a 'Q?'"  The man answers, <<<
Well . . . there's the royal family . . .
>>> 
1995-04-10 * 
A co-worker shows Dilbert and Wally a keyboard.  The co-worker says, <<<
This ergonomic keyboard is our fist product developed under the 'Big Q' program.
>>> The man continues, <<<
The 'Q' stands for quality.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Speaking of Q . . . it's missing the letter Q.
>>> The man says angrily, <<<
You sound just like our whiny customers.
>>>  Dilbert says, I guess the 'Q' stands for 'uality.'
>>> 
1995-04-09 * 
Wally sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
We ranked all the engineers from best to worst.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
We plan to get rid of the bottom ten percent.  That includes you, Wally.
>>> Wally replies, <<<
Your plan is logically flawed.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
If you fire the bottom ten percent, you'll STILL have a bottom 10&#037;.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
You'll fire and fire, but there will always be a bottom 10&#037;, until finally . . .
>>> Wally stands up and shouts, <<<
When less than ten people are left you'll have to fire body parts instead of whole people!!!
>>> Wally screams, <<<
We'll have torsos and glands wandering around unable to use keyboards . . . Blood and bile everywhere!!!
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How'd it go?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
He fired my hair.
>>> 
1995-04-08 * 
Dilbert looks a tape measure and tells the Boss, <<<
Just as I thought, my cubicle is two inches smaller today than yesterday!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
We installed real-time status adjusters in the cubicle walls.  Sensors monitor your work and adjust the cubicle size according to your value.
>>> Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit in cubicles that are so small they can barely fit inside them.  Wally says, <<<
It's amazing how fast you get used to it.
>>> 
1995-04-07 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert are sitting on the couch.  Dogbert says, <<<
Try this little trick to improve your career . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Anytime you want something your way, simply refer to your CEO by his first name and say he gave you directions during your very recent meeting.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
It's totally unverifiable.  People will fear you and do as you say.  You'll rule with an iron fist!
>>>  Dilbert responds, <<<
You're a funny little dog.
>>> 
1995-04-06 * 
The Boss, Dogbert and an Elbonian sit around a conference table.  The Elbonian says, <<<
We're offering attractive incentives to companies that move to Elbonia.
>>> The Elbonian continues, <<<
Zero taxes, cheerful slave labor, amnesty from any inconvenient laws, and absolutely no environmental regulations!
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Is that the best you can do?
>>>  The Elbonian hands a baby across the table and says, <<<
Here, use my first born son as a lawn ornament.
>>> 
1995-04-05 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert and Alice, <<<
I want to assure you that any rumors you've heard are false.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
We are NOT planning to relocate the company to the South Pole where easily trainable native Eskimos will replace you.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's good because there aren't any Eskimos at the South Pole.
>>>  The Boss looks shocked and says, <<<
Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.
>>> 
1995-04-04 * 
Pointing to a map, Dogbert tells the Boss, <<<
Your best bet is to relocate the company to Russia.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
You can hire engineers for two cents a year!
>>>  The Boss asks, <<<
Is it difficult to weed out the dumb ones?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
No.  And that leads me into the good news about their occupational safety laws.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
It's like heaven!
>>> 
1995-04-03 * 
As Dilbert and Wally walk by, the Boss asks, <<<
My laptop computer is locked up.  Can you help?
>>> Dilbert holds an Etch-a-Sketch over his head and shakes it.  He tells the Boss, <<<
Remember you have to hold it upside down and shake it to reboot.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Oh, that's right.
>>> Wally says to Dilbert as they walk away, <<<
I wonder if he'll ever realize we gave him an 'Etch-a-Sketch.'
>>> 
1995-04-02 * 
The Boss tells Wally and Dilbert, <<<
I'd like you guys to check Anne's advertising materials for technical accuracy.
>>> Wally, Dilbert and Anne sit at a conference table.  Wally reads the ad copy and asks, <<<
Is this supposed to be funny?
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I don't get it.
>>> Anne says, <<<
I'm only looking for technical help here.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Hey!  Maybe you could say something about those warning tags on mattresses!  Now THAT would be funny!
>>> Anne covers her eyes and leans on the table.  Dilbert says, <<<
Or how about the fact that you can't look up something in the dictionary if you can't spell it?  THAT's funny!
>>> Anne stands up and screams, <<<
You're engineers, not comedians!!  I want TECHNICAL help!!!
>>> Wally says, <<<
This guy has an XP-6.  It should be an XP-7.
>>>  Anne says, <<<
That's better.
>>> Wally adds, <<<
And he should be saying, 'I've fallen and I can't get up.'"  Dilbert asks, <<<
Who picked these colors?
>>> 
1995-04-01 * 
The Boss, Wally, Alice and Dilbert sit around a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Each of you will write your objectives and give them to me.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Then I will sculpt these disparate pieces of clay into an elegant tapestry which will be our business plan.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
Our business plan will be like a clay tapestry?
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Feel free to quote me.
>>> 
1995-03-31 * 
Dilbert, Alice and Wally sit at a conference table.  Alice says, <<<
I'd like to kick-off the project with the traditional bad-mouthing of the guy who worked on this before.
>>> Alice yells, <<<
He's so slimy that slugs pour salt on HIM.  His brain would rattle in a flea's skull!
>>> Alice turns to Wally and says, <<<
Oh, and I'll need your files.
>>>  Wally answers angrily, <<<
Fleas don't have 'skulls!!'
>>> 
1995-03-30 * 
Liz sits at her computer and Dilbert looks over her shoulder.  Liz says, <<<
I built a spreadsheet to compare our relative qualities.  I'm afraid I'm twenty percent too good for you.  We must stop dating.
>>> Dilbert points at the screen and says, <<<
NO!  Look, Liz, you have the wrong formula in this column!  That must mean I have higher math skills than you!  We're almost even!
>>> After Dilbert leaves, Liz sits at her computer and Dogbert sits on her printer.  Dogbert says to Liz, <<<
You left that error in there intentionally.
>>>  Liz answers, <<<
My last batch of flowers is wilting.
>>> 
1995-03-29 * 
The Boss stands outside a row of cubicles.  Wally peeks out of his cubicle and Dilbert stands in the door of his cubicle.  The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
Our Elbonian owners sold the company to our biggest competitor.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Our motto is 'If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.'"  Dilbert says, <<<
I wonder what THEIR motto is.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Their motto is 'After you beat 'em, humiliate 'em.'"  Dilbert says, <<<
It's not very catchy.
>>> 
1995-03-28 * 
Alice, Dilbert, Wally and an Elbonian sit around a conference table.  The Elbonian hands a coffee cup to Alice who says, <<<
In this country we have a custom when men ask women to fetch coffee.
>>> Alice continues, <<<
Stand up . . . That's it . . . Now this will really surprise you.
>>>  Dilbert and Wally cover their eyes and Wally says, <<<
Oh God.
>>> A hat with feet sticking out of it sits on the chair where the Elbonian was sitting.  Wally says, <<<
I've never seen anybody get kicked into his hat before.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
That's gotta hurt.
>>> 
1995-03-27 * 
Dilbert, Wally and Alice stand outside a conference room holding folders.  Alice says, <<<
In a way, I'm glad the Elbonians run this company now.
>>> As they take their seats at the conference table, Alice smiles and says, <<<
After years of being the only female engineer I'll enjoy watching the Elbonians discriminate against you guys.
>>> The Elbonian sitting next to Alice hands her a mug and says, <<<
I didn't realize you had coffee wenches in this country too.
>>>  Alice looks furious.  Wally says to the Elbonian, <<<
I hope you don't want children, Yorgi.
>>>  A caption reads, <<<
Continued . . .
>>> 
1995-03-26 * 
Dilbert stands at the copier reading a message that says, <<<
Please enter photocopier access code.
>>>  A woman stands behind him. Dilbert asks, <<<
What's the code for this machine?
>>>  The woman replies, <<<
That's proprietary information.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
We work for the same company.  My cubicle is down the hall.
>>> The woman says, <<<
I have no way of verifying your claim.  Anybody could come in here and say that.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Ask me a question that only an employee of this company could answer.
>>>  The woman replies, <<<
Okay.
>>> The woman asks, <<<
What is the access code for this copier?
>>> Dilbert looks at the woman. Dilbert covers his eyes and sobs.  The woman holds up a document and says, <<<
I just have one . . .
>>> 
1995-03-25 * 
Dilbert is in a computer retail store.  The salesman points to a computer and explains, <<<
. . . but by far, this computer is our most user-friendly.
>>> The salesman continues, <<<
The pre-installed software has only one button.  And we press it before it leaves the factory.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What does it do?
>>>  The salesman waves his hands and says, <<<
Whoa!  I'm in over my head.  Let me give you their tech support number.
>>> 
1995-03-24 * 
Dilbert sits in his cubicle.  He asks Dogbert, <<<
How could the Elbonians afford to buy this company?  Their whole country is just mud.
>>> Dogbert imagines a television screen showing an Elbonian holding a container with the figure <<<
$119.95" above him. Dogbert answers, <<<
They packaged the mud and sold it as a cosmetic on the 'Couch Shopping Network.'  They made trillions.
>>> Hugging his knees to his chest, Dilbert comments, <<<
At least they know how to manage resources.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
They sold their entire country in little jars.  Most Elbonians perished in molten lava at the Earth's core.
>>> 
1995-03-23 * 
Dogbert stands on a desk and addresses Wally, Dilbert and the Boss.  Dogbert says, <<<
I've decided to sell the company for a huge profit.  I found some very discriminating buyers.
>>> Wally asks Dogbert, <<<
When you say discriminating, you mean . . . ?
>>>  Dogbert answers, <<<
They hate people from this country.
>>> Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
It's okay.  We have laws to protect us.
>>>  One Elbonian says to the other, <<<
They're lazy, but at least they're funny!
>>>  The other laughs, <<<
Hee hee.
>>>  The Boss looks shocked. 
1995-03-22 * 
Catbert stands on a cubicle wall, dangling a chart by a string.  Catbert says, <<<
Come see the new org chart.
>>>  Wally and Alice run toward the chart with out-streched arms. Catbert yanks the chart out of reach and says, <<<
Oops, changed my mind!
>>>  Wally and Alice collide, producing the noise, <<<
Wham!
>>> Wally and Alice walk away from the collision looking dazed and wearing each other's clothes.  Alice says, <<<
Ouchie.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I'm sore, but I've never felt so free.
>>> 
1995-03-21 * 
Catbert stands on a cubicle wall waving a document.  Catbert says to Alice, <<<
Here's the new org chart.  Maybe you're on it and maybe not.
>>> Alice jumps up and tries to reach the sheet as Catbert holds it out of reach.  Catbert taunts, <<<
Ooh!  Nice try!  So close.  Too bad.
>>> Catbert ties the chart to a string and dangles it into the cubicles.  Wally and Alice lunge for it.  Catbert says, <<<
It's fun to play with them before downsizing them.
>>> 
1995-03-20 * 
Dogbert stands on a desk and tells the Boss, <<<
I hired a new director of Human Resources to handle the downsizing.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I needed somebody who acts like a friend but secretly delights in the misery of all people.
>>> Catbert stands on a monitor and says to an employee, <<<
We need to talk, Paul.  But first I'm going to bat your head around and scratch you.
>>>  Paul responds, <<<
Hee hee!!  That's so cute!
>>> 
1995-03-19 * 
Dilbert and a man sit at a conference table.  Dilbert says, <<<
So . . . Okay, great . . .
>>>  The man says, <<<
Alright then . . .
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I'm trapped in the meeting that would not conclude!!
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I'm too polite to say 'We're done.  Please leave.'"  The man says, <<<
Like I said before . . .
>>> Dilbert covers his eyes and thinks, <<<
Oh no!  I missed the window - he's reiterating!!!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So . . . Okay, great . . .
>>>  The man says, <<<
Alright then . . .
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Maybe if I shake his hand he'll leave.
>>>  The man says, <<<
But like I said before . . .
>>> Dilbert waves his arms and shouts, <<<
Nooooooo!!
>>> Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
. . . Then there was sort of a long awkward pause . . .
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
So . . . Okay, great . . .
>>> 
1995-03-18 * 
Dilbert and Wally stand in front of Dogbert who is sitting at a desk.  Dilbert asks Dogbert, <<<
Now that you own the company, what do you plan to do?
>>>  Dogbert answers, <<<
Trim middle management.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I'll fire anybody who gives me a document marked 'FYI.'  Those people have too much time on their hands.
>>> A manager carrying a wheelbarrow full of documents marked "FYI" asks Dilbert and Wally, <<<
Are you sure this will set me apart from the other managers?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
You'll be surprised how quickly.
>>> 
1995-03-17 * 
Dogbert sits at the Boss's desk.  Dilbert and Alice stand in front of him.  Dilbert says, <<<
The rumors are destroying our productivity.  We can't work with all this uncertainty.
>>> Dogbert answers, <<<
I plan to buy proven technology and hire contract employees.  You'll be gophers for the contractors until you resign in disgust and humiliation.
>>> Dilbert and Alice look scared.  Dilbert asks, <<<
Is there any way to get back to uncertainty?
>>>  Dogbert answers, <<<
I'll see what I can do.
>>> 
1995-03-16 * 
Dogbert stands on a podium addressing a crowd of office workers, including Dilbert, Wally and Alice.  Dogbert says, <<<
As new owner of this company I hereby ban all meetings over one hour.  The dress code is casual.  Status reports are optional!
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
No more mission statements or 'visions.'  Our motto is 'have fun, satisfy customers, make money.'
>>> Dilbert sleeps in his chair.  In Dilbert's dream, Dogbert concludes his speech to the employees, <<<
And stock options for all.
>>>  Outside Dilbert's cubicle, Dogbert says to the Boss, <<<
We can fit five more in this cubicle if we remove the chair.
>>> 
1995-03-15 * 
Dogbert sits at a conference table with the Boss and three other managers.  Dogbert says, <<<
Your stock was $30 per share when I offered to buy the company, but thanks to some timely leaks to the media your value has plunged.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
However, if you sell right now I'll pay the full $30 for your stock.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
I recommend we do it.
>>> A manager hands the signed contract back to Dogbert and says, <<<
Done.  $30 per share is more than fair.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Yeah, 'per share' would have been fair.  Anybody want a copy?
>>>  The Boss looks shocked. 
1995-03-14 * 
Dogbert introduces the Grim Reaper to the Boss.  Dogbert says, <<<
My consultant will audit your company to make sure there are no surprises before I buy it.
>>>  The Boss looks shocked. Dogbert sits on the edge of the desk while the Grim Reaper looks through a stack of documents.  Dogbert says to the Boss, <<<
I use him because he's seen such hideous things that nothing scares him.
>>>  The Grim Reaper looks at a document and says, <<<
Erk.
>>> The Grim Reaper throws documents into the air and shouts, <<<
AAAAAEEII!!  OOOUWAA WAA!!
>>>  Dogbert says to the Boss, <<<
That's not the sound you want from your auditor.
>>> 
1995-03-13 * 
Dilbert sits at a conference table with the Boss and Dogbert.  Dogbert says, <<<
I promise that if I decide to buy your company I'll gladly recommend a position for each of you.
>>> Wally, who is also sitting at the table, asks, <<<
Really?  You'd make sure we all got jobs?
>>> Dogbert answers, <<<
No, but I'll recommend a 'position.'"  Dilbert and the Boss look shocked. 
1995-03-12 * 
Tina asks Dilbert, <<<
Did you review my draft documentation yet?
>>>  Dilbert sits at his desk and replies, <<<
Uh . . . I'll get to it soon.
>>> Tina says, <<<
That's what you've been saying since July!!
>>> Tina continues, <<<
I know I'm only a lowly technical writer and you're a big important engineer . . .
>>> Tina screams, <<<
But is it too much to ask for you to glance at the fruits of my labor?!!!
>>> Tina grabs Dilbert's tie and yells, <<<
Five lousy mintues is all it would take to validate my value on this planet!  Read it, you fetid pile of compost!!
>>> Dilbert opens a binder and says, <<<
Okay, okay!  I'll read it right now!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
These pages are blank!  You've been bluffing for months!
>>>  Tina looks nervous. Tina says, <<<
I think I'll go have a yummy compost salad with delicious fetid cheese.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I'm going to look up those words.
>>> 
1995-03-11 * 
The Boss and a woman walk by Dilbert's cubicle holding folders.  Leaning back in his chair to look out of the cubicle, Dilbert thinks, <<<
Uh-Oh . . . the managers are going to another closed-door meeting.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
It must be about pay cuts or layoffs.  I'm doomed.  I'd better work on my resume NOW.
>>>  He pulls nervously at his tie, his hair stands on end and beads of sweat fly from his forehead. The Boss sits around a conference table with three other managers.  Reading from a document, he says, <<<
Okay, so far our 'leadership vision' says 'we inspire employees to action.'  Does anybody have upgrades?
>>>  Another man responds, <<<
Nah.
>>> 
1995-03-10 * 
The Boss sits at his desk and Dilbert sits across from him.  The Boss tells Dilbert, <<<
Your performance this year was good, but you worked on tasks that aren't important.  Therefore you get a tiny raise.
>>> Dilbert looks angry as he replies, <<<
I worked on the tasks YOU assigned.  What's that say about YOUR performance?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
It's excellent.  I get a bonus for keeping salaries low.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Have you seen any literature on workplace violence?
>>> 
1995-03-09 * 
Dilbert, Wally, Alice, the Boss and another worker sit around a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
From now on, the managers at my level will be called 'thought leaders.'
>>> Dilbert and Wally stare at him in amazement. Dilbert asks Wally, <<<
What's wrong with this picture?
>>>  The Boss's thoughts are shown to be empty. 
1995-03-08 * 
The Boss peers into Dilbert's cubicle and asks, <<<
Are you working twice as fast since I doubled your staff?
>>> Dilbert sits at his desk with Barry.  He answers, <<<
I've coded twelve modules . . . Barry is on a journey of discovery where he will find out my mouse is not a microphone.
>>>  Speaking into the mouse, Barry says, <<<
Hello!  Anybody!
>>> Back in his office, the Boss sits in front of the computer contemplating his mouse.  He says, <<<
That would explain why nobody ever comments on my announcements over the P.A. system.
>>> 
1995-03-07 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk and turns around as the Boss enters.  The Boss says, <<<
We need to finish your program twice as fast, so I'm adding a person to help you.
>>> The Boss says as he leaves Dilbert's cubicle, <<<
You might need to train him a little before he's productive.
>>>  Dilbert waves his arms as he thinks, <<<
Warning!  Warning!  Dr. Smith.
>>> Dilbert sits at his desk with the new co-worker, a small man with big ears and a disheveled shirt collar.  Pointing at the monitor, he asks Dilbert, <<<
Tell me again what the big glowing thing is.
>>> 
1995-03-06 * 
The Boss enters Dilbert's cubicle and asks, <<<
Can you explain why you're a week behind schedule?
>>> Dilbert turns to face the Boss and says, <<<
Your poor leadership has drained me of the enthusiasm that is necessary to succeed.  But it's not completely YOUR fault.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Frankly, your parents have to accept some responsibility for creating you.
>>>  The Boss asks, <<<
Even if they were drunk?
>>> 
1995-03-05 * 
Dilbert sits on the couch reading a magazine with his feet on the coffee table.  Dogbert and Ratbert stand on the table.  Dogbert says, <<<
We're going downtown to play 'security guards in space.'"  Dilbert says, <<<
I don't want to know.
>>> Dogbert and Ratbert walk down the sidewalk pulling a lunch box shaped like a space rocket.  Ratbert says, <<<
Let's try that building.
>>> The security guard says to Dogbert, <<<
I'll need to see your I.D. badge, sir.
>>> Dogbert shows him something and says, <<<
Look fast!!  There it is!!  Not a pack of matches!!
>>>  The security guard says, <<<
Okay.
>>> The guard says, <<<
I'll have to search your lunch box.
>>> The guard looks inside the rocket and says, <<<
It's just a bunch of wires and gizmos.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
You're making me SO hungry.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Could you watch my lunch while I take the cart back to my car?
>>> The guard sits on the rocket.  Dogbert tells Ratbert, <<<
I feel bad, but it's the only way to test if space travel is safe for us animals.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
I feel safer already 
>>> 
1995-03-04 * 
The Boss hands Dilbert a sheet of paper and says, <<<
From now on, salaries will be based on your predicted success, not your past performance.
>>> While Dilbert reads the report, the Boss says, <<<
We ran a computer model against your education and DNA information.  We predict you'll die in a stapler mishap within a week.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What if I disagree with this prediction?
>>>  The Boss points at Dilbert and says, <<<
Write up your opinion and staple it to the analysis.
>>> 
1995-03-03 * 
The Boss holds a syringe.  He says to Dilbert, <<<
Drop your trousers and turn around.  I need a DNA sample.
>>> Dilbert bends over looking angry.  As draws Dilbert's blood, the Boss says, <<<
We're scanning for any fatal genetic problems that could hurt productivity.
>>> Dilbert sits at his desk.  The Boss enters holding the test results and says, <<<
Uh . . . we decided to move your project deadline up a week.
>>>  Dilbert's hair stands up straight. 
1995-03-02 * 
Alice, Wally, Dilbert and the Boss sit around a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
We're announcing two new programs for employees.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
The first is a new dignity enhancement program and the second is our new random drug testing initiative.
>>> Alice says to Wally, <<<
The clue meter is reading zero.
>>>  The Boss reaches toward them holding a coffee mug and says, <<<
You each get a handsome coffee mug as part of the kick-off.
>>> 
1995-03-01 * 
Dilbert and Wally sit at a table eating lunch. Alice walks over and says, <<<
Why is it that I never have time to eat but you MEN are in here every day at 11:35?
>>> Wally replies, <<<
Because the hours we spent upgrading our PCs have finally paid off by greatly improving our efficiency.
>>> After Alice has left the table, Dilbert says to Wally, <<<
I thought it was because we get hungry at 11:30?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
We can't reveal all our secrets.
>>> 
1995-02-28 * 
The Boss hands a check to Ted while Wally, Dilbert and Alice watch.  The Boss says, <<<
And Ted gets this 'Singular Achievement' award for creating the 'We Are Teams' campaign.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It's a check for a thousand dollars!  Let's all give Ted a hand.
>>>  Ted walks by holding the check and Wally, Alice and Dilbert look angry. As Wally, Alice and Dilbert hit and slap Ted the Boss thinks, <<<
These things never work the way you want them to.
>>> 
1995-02-27 * 
The Boss, Dilbert and another worker sit at a conference table.  The worker says, <<<
I'm happy to report that the 'Excellence in Teaming' read-out is nearly ready.
>>> The worker continues, <<<
It's taken forty people from a dozen departments to complete the study.  We finally got complete buy-in.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Is that the study of why we can't make decisions?
>>>  The worker responds, <<<
Originally.  But it evolved into more of a discussion of squirrel migration patterns.
>>> 
1995-02-26 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit on a couch.  Dilbert's mom hands him a plate and says, <<<
Here's some nice chocolate cake for you and Dogbert.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Thank, Mom.
>>>  Dogbert also says, <<<
Thanks, Mom.
>>> Dilbert's mother says, <<<
Tell me all about your job at the railroad.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
It's not a railroad.  I'm an engineer at a big corporation.
>>> Dilbert's mom asks, <<<
Do you fix the typewriters when they break?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
No . . . Today I debugged a TCP/IP driver for an application that runs over ISDN with bonding.
>>> Dilbert's mom asks, <<<
You mean, all you do is slap a BRI analyzer on a circuit and look for bad packets?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Well . . . Yeah.  But it's really hard.
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert walk outdoors.  Dilbert says, <<<
I was doing okay until she offered to pay my tuition to typewriter repair school.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
You shouldn't have compared her cake to packing foam.
>>> 
1995-02-25 * 
The Boss sits at his desk and Alice sits across from him.  The Boss says, <<<
I've replaced the old rating system with a friendlier method.  Now I compare each of you to an animal with similar traits.
>>> The Boss pushes a document toward Alice and says, <<<
I rated you 'Tyrannosaurus Rex.'
>>> Alice looks excited and says, <<<
T. Rex - the mightiest dinosaur!!
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Think in terms of brain size.
>>> 
1995-02-24 * 
Alice tells Wally and Dilbert, <<<
I'm terrified about my performance review tomorrow.
>>> Alice continues, <<<
Men have it easier.  You've been conditioned by years of rejection and general disdain.
>>>  Wally responds, <<<
We're lucky that way.
>>> The Boss sits at his desk and reads a document to a male worker sitting across from him.  The Boss says, <<<
Overall, I rated your performance as 'simian.'"  The worker responds, <<<
Thanks!
>>> 
1995-02-23 * 
The Boss stands behind Alice's desk and says, <<<
Alice, I'm almost done with your performance appraisal.
>>>  Alice looks horrified and gasps. Alice turns her chair to face the Boss and says, <<<
I haven't had an appraisal in four years.  You must be starting a documentation trail so you can fire me later.
>>> Alice types wildly and yells, <<<
I'LL WORK 24 HOURS A DAY!!
>>>  The Boss thinks, <<<
That was way more motivational than I'd hoped.
>>> 
1995-02-22 * 
The Boss, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
We've been having a problem with black-outs.  The office lights are controlled by motion detectors.
>>> A man stands next to the Boss flapping his arms.  The Boss continues, <<<
I hired a temp to walk around and flap his arms so the lights won't go off.
>>> Dilbert and Wally watch the temp flap his arms.  Dilbert says, <<<
Another Journalism major enters the workforce.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
It seems like a waste.  Maybe he could fan us.
>>> 
1995-02-21 * 
Dilbert asks Dogbert who sits on the armrest of the couch, <<<
Dogbert, I need your help dealing with a pathological liar at work.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You're in luck.  I happen to have a Ph.D. in Liatology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
>>> Dilbert crosses his arms and says defiantly, <<<
I'd love to see your diploma.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I'll mail it to you.
>>> 
1995-02-20 * 
A co-worker says to Dilbert, <<<
Reliable sources say your project will be canceled, Dilbert.
>>> The co-worker continues, <<<
You should abandon it now and come work on MY project.  When my big promotion goes through next month, I'll transfer you to my group and give you a raise.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's very tempting except for the fact you're a pathological liar.
>>>  The co-worker waves his hands and says, <<<
Be careful what you say - I have super powers.
>>> 
1995-02-19 * 
The panel is titled, <<<

Find your boss on this handy reference.

Blah blah.

Ow!!

Then we'll subnet our IP addresses.

Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.

Let's qualitize our paradigm so we don't over inundate with datums.
>>> The caption says, <<<
Weasel: Takes credit for your hard work.
>>>  A man holding a bag of money tells a woman, <<<
This bonus is for brilliantly forcing your staff to work 80 hour weeks.
>>>  The woman replies, <<<
It wasn't easy!
>>> The caption says, <<<
Moses: Perpetually waits for clear signals from above.
>>>  The Boss, Wally and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Don't do anything important yet.

Never have.
>>> The caption says, <<<
Perfect Boss:  Dies of natural causes on a Thursday afternoon.
>>>  Alice looks at a dead body and asks, <<<
Should we do something?
>>>  Wally yells, <<<
Three day weekend!
>>> 
1995-02-18 * 
The caption reads, <<<
Bad news.
>>>  The Boss sits at his desk saying, <<<
We're not giving any raises.
>>> The captions reads, <<<
Making it worse.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
But we think work is its own reward.
>>> The caption reads, <<<
Making it MUCH worse.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Expect to get rewarded about twice as much next year.
>>> 
1995-02-17 * 
The caption reads, <<<
The problem . . .
>>>  Dilbert enters looking frazzled and says to the Boss, <<<
We're so under-staffed that the project is six weeks behind schedule.
>>> The caption reads, <<<
The analysis . . .
>>>  The Boss looks pensive and thinks, <<<
I can't add people . . . I can't change the due date . . . I can't ignore it.
>>> The caption reads, <<<
The result . . .
>>>  Dilbert says to Wally and Alice, <<<
He wants daily status reports until the situation improves.
>>>  All three look overworked and disheveled. 
1995-02-16 * 
Alice walks in carrying a briefcase and sees Wally and Dilbert drinking coffee.  Alice says, <<<
I was so late I had to put on my makeup in the car.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Yeah, I had to shave in the car.
>>> Wally says, <<<
That's nothing.  I was so late that I had to give myself a sponge bath in the car.
>>> Alice looks shocked and asks, <<<
Aren't you the driver for your carpool?
>>>  Wally responds, <<<
You've never heard such whining.
>>> 
1995-02-15 * 
Dilbert peers over the cubicle wall and says, <<<
Wally, you just sent me the same e-mail you sent last week.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm rerunning the 'Best of Wally' while I'm on in-cube sabbatical.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How long is your sabbatical?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
Six months so far, and you're the first to notice.
>>> 
1995-02-14 * 
The Boss, Wally, Dilbert, Alice and another worker sit at a conference table.  The Boss holds a document and says, <<<
You should all follow Wally's example of how he quantifies his contribution to revenue.
>>> Wally explains, <<<
Basically, I assumed my project would fail without me.  Therefore all the revenue it generates can be attributed to me.
>>> The other worker asks, <<<
Aren't we all on the same project?
>>>  Wally answers, <<<
Yes, but evidently we're not all equally valuable.
>>> 
1995-02-13 * 
The Boss hands Dilbert a document and says, <<<
I'm asking everybody to quantify their contributions to revenue.  Your pay will depend on it.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I realize this is hard to quantify because you're designing future products but . . . <<<
  Dilbert writes a figure on the paper and says, <<<
Here you go.
>>> The Boss reads what Dilbert wrote and says, <<<
A billion dollars?  It's as if you cynically believe we can't track these numbers.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
That crossed my mind.
>>> 
1995-02-12 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  The Boss says, <<<
I'm putting you on the strategic planning team.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It's like work but without the satisfaction of accomplishing anything.
>>> Dilbert and three co-workers sit at a conference table.  A man says, <<<
You're new, so let me explain how this works.
>>> The man continues, <<<
We have meetings and talk about the company's strategy in vague emotional terms.
>>> The man continues, <<<
In time, we convince ourselves that we're more than mediocre thinkers who sit around complaining.
>>> The man continues, <<<
We start believing our opinions will steer the company.  We feel important.  We feel ALIVE!!
>>> A woman tells Dilbert, <<<
Then we snap out of it and make viewgraphs that say we should keep doing what we're doing.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I like making viewgraphs.
>>>  The woman replies, <<<
Actually, we use last year's viewgraph.
>>> 
1995-02-11 * 
The Boss, Wally, Dilbert and Alice sit around a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I'd like each of you to give me a current resume.
>>> Waving his hands, the Boss continues, <<<
Now, don't be alarmed.  It's just so the new VP can get to know you.  It's not an obvious prelude to massive staff cuts.
>>> Wally, Dilbert and Alice immediately hand resumes to the Boss who asks, <<<
Should I be worried that you all have a current resume on you?
>>>  Wally answers, <<<
Don't worry.  It's not an obvious prelude to massive disloyalty!
>>> 
1995-02-10 * 
Alice shows the Boss a document and says angrily, <<<
When you consider the hours I work, I make less per hour than the janitor!
>>> The janitor enters carrying a plunger with a small animal sticking out of it.  He says to the Boss, <<<
Look what was blocking the pipes!  It took me all morning to plunge the rascal out.
>>>  Alice and the Boss look surprised. Still looking shocked, Alice says, <<<
I love my job.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
I'm giving him a raise.
>>> 
1995-02-09 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk at home.  He is naked.  He types in his daily log, <<<
On my forth day of telecommuting I realize that clothes are totally unnecessary.
>>> Dilbert strokes his unshaven face and thinks, <<<
Hey!
>>>  The log reads, <<<
Suddenly I am struck by a question: why don't monkeys grow beards?
>>> The log reads, <<<
I call a meeting to discuss the issue but attendance is low.
>>>  Dilbert sits at a conference table with Ratbert.  Dilbert reads from a document, <<<
Issue one: monkey beards.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
Let's go around the table and introduce ourselves.
>>> 
1995-02-08 * 
The caption, an entry from Dilbert's daily log, reads, <<<
Day three of telecommuting: I spend the morning throwing my pen in the air.
>>>  Dilbert sits at his desk at home dressed in a bathrobe and looking unshaven.  He tosses a pen into the air. The pen falls and hits Dilbert in the head, causing him to lose his balance and fall off the chair. The caption reads, <<<
The afternoon is spent in silent appreciation of how much better this is than being in the office.
>>>  Dilbert lies on the floor with his feet on the desk chair and thinks, <<<
Ahh.
>>> 
1995-02-07 * 
Dilbert sits at his computer at home, dressed in a bathrobe and looking unshaven.  He types, <<<
Day two of telecommuting is going smoothly.  I have eliminated all optional habits of hygiene.
>>> Dilbert continues typing, <<<
My co-workers are a fading memory.  I am losing language skills.  I talk to my computer and expect answers.
>>> Dilbert types, <<<
For reasons that are unclear, my dog wears a gas mask and shouts tarzan-like phrases.
>>>  Dogbert stands behind Dilbert wearing a gas mask and yelling, <<<
Kreegah!  Bundalo!
>>> 
1995-02-06 * 
Dogbert sits at Dilbert's desk at home.  Dilbert stands in front of the desk holding a cup of coffee and dressed in a bathrobe.  Dilbert says, <<<
I have an ethical question about telecommuting, Dogbert.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Do I owe my employer eight productive hours, or do I only need to match the two productive hours I would have in the office?
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert sit on the desk chair together.  Dogbert answers, <<<
Well, when you factor in how you're saving the planet by not driving, you only owe one hour.
>>>  Dilbert adds, <<<
And this meeting counts.
>>> 
1995-02-05 * 
Dogbert points to a sign that says, <<<
Dogbert explains leadership.
>>> Dogbert points to a man who is wearing an untucked shirt and staring blankly ahead.  Dogbert says, <<<
Leaders start their careers as morons.
>>> The caption says, <<<
They are drawn to meetings like moths to a porch light.  The moron walks toward a conference room. Dogbert points to a diagram of a human body.  He says, <<<
The successful moron will have a very high bladder-to-brain ratio.
>>> The caption says, <<<
They prevail in all decisions because they are impervious to logic or coffee.
>>>  Dilbert sits at a conference table with the moron and another man.  The moron says, <<<
Let's do it my way!
>>>  The other man says, <<<
Okay!
>>> The caption says, <<<
These qualities are perceived as leadership.
>>>  The moron pours coffee on himself.  The Boss tells the moron, <<<
You're promoted!
>>> The caption says, <<<
After several promotions their job tends to match their talents.
>>>  The moron tells Dilbert, <<<
I award you this award.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Conclusion: leadership is nature's way of removing morons from the productive flow.
>>> 
1995-02-04 * 
The Boss stands in front of Dilbert who is seated at his desk.  The Boss hands Dilbert a document and says, <<<
I ranked all of your assignments by priority so you won't waste time on unimportant stuff.
>>> Dilbert reads the document and says, <<<
Everything is an 'A' priority except for 'Personal life.'
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
this helps a lot.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
I'm still working on the list of 'Must do' 'B' priorities.
>>> 
1995-02-03 * 
Alice stands in front of the Boss's desk dressed in a shirt, tie and pants.  She says to the Boss, <<<
I'm dressing like a man to protest the company's dress code.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
So, what you're saying is that you're actually a woman.  Is that your claim?
>>> Alice says, <<<
That's not exactly the point.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
I saw 'The Crying Game.'  Don't do anything that would make me heave.
>>> 
1995-02-02 * 
Alice is dressed in a shirt, tie and pants.  Alice says to Dilbert and Wally, <<<
I'm protesting the company's dress code.  I refuse to dress like a woman.
>>> Alice clenches her fist and continues forcefully, <<<
High heels and pantyhose are designed to make women look like helpless little ornaments for the pleasure of male viewers!
>>> Wally says, <<<
I've never had pleasure viewing you.  I swear.
>>>  Alice says, <<<
Thank you for your support.
>>> 
1995-02-01 * 
Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  Both of them look like they have been burned in a fire.  Dilbert says, <<<
My status report is a bit light this week because I'm having an e-mail flame war with Wally.
>>> Dilbert continues angrily, <<<
Wally refuses to admit my technical superiority or his simian ancestry.  It is my obligation to set him straight.
>>>  Wally shakes his fist at Dilbert and shouts, <<<
NEVER!!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm thinking this somehow elevates my rank in the herd and improves my mating possibilities.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
We're victims of hormones.
>>> 
1995-01-31 * 
Dilbert types, <<<
Your ignorance seems to have no limit.  Your opinions are idiotic.
>>> Dilbert continues typing, <<<
Your personal hygiene leaves much to be desired.  Your family is ugly.
>>>  He enters, <<<
Send e-mail.
>>> Peering over the cubicle wall, Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
You're mighty brave in cyberspace, Flame-boy.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Step inside.
>>> 
1995-01-30 * 
The Boss carries a laptop in a case.  He says to Wally, <<<
This laptop computer weighs too much.  Do we have anything lighter?
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Why don't you just delete files to lower the weight on that one?
>>> As he works on the laptop the Boss says, <<<
That's a thought.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Technically, I only asked why not.
>>> 
1995-01-29 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'll be down at the lake, pushing people in.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You need a new hobby, Dogbert.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
It's a SPORT!
>>> Dilbert stands on the lakeshore behind a man holding a fishing pole.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Having any luck today?
>>> The man replies, <<<
Yeah, I got me a pretty one.  You should have seen it flopping around.  Beautiful!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Beautiful??  Are you saying there's beauty in causing a lower form of life to suffer?
>>> The man holds a fish and says, <<<
Only if it's a big one.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
How much do you weigh?
>>>  The man replies, <<<
Oh, about 210 pounds, I reckon.
>>> Dogbert has pushed the man into the water.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Would you mind flopping around some more?
>>>  A fish swims near the fisherman and says, <<<
It's beautiful.
>>> 
1995-01-28 * 
A new worker says to Dilbert and Wally, <<<
I've only worked here one day but I thought of a great idea.
>>> The Boss runs in with a fire hose and soaks the new employee with a stream of water. Dilbert says to the drenched worker, <<<
The first idea is always the toughest.
>>>  Wally adds, <<<
The urge eventually goes away.
>>> 
1995-01-27 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
We've been asked to reduce our budget.  I'm going to offer to cut your project because it's the most critical.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
The finance guys won't dare cut that project.  My ploy will spare us from any cuts at all.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Excuse me while I panic.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Tell me again what your project is about.  They might ask.
>>> 
1995-01-26 * 
The Boss sits at a conference table with Wally and Dilbert.  The Boss says, <<<
Maybe we could form a vision statement of our concepts for requirements.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Or maybe we can bound our strawman by the mission-critical functions of our quality vector!
>>> As they walk away, Dilbert says to Wally, <<<
You're shameless.
>>>  Wally responds, <<<
There's a fine line between participation and mockery.
>>> 
1995-01-25 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk clenching his fist.  He thinks, <<<
I hate being team leader.  It's so stressful.
>>> Dilbert continues thinking, <<<
I have reponsibility but no authority.  I feel like I'm an animal in some warped behavioral study.
>>>  He hears a "Ding" coming from behind him. Dilbert turns his chair around and reaches for a dispenser on the wall with a sign above it that says, <<<
Take pellet.
>>>  He thinks, <<<
On the plus side, the pellets are excellent.
>>> 
1995-01-24 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss who is seated at his desk.  Dilbert asks, <<<
As team leader, I think I should get some perks so people know my status.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
I'll have your cubicle walls sprayed with a special thickening agent.  It might look the same, but trust me, people will know how thick you are.
>>> Dilbert peers over his cubicle wall into Wally's cubicle and says, <<<
I'm just like you, Wally, but thicker.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I've noticed.
>>> 
1995-01-23 * 
Dilbert, Alice and Wally sit around a conference table.  Dilbert says, <<<
As you know, I've been promoted to team leader.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
Will you decide raises?  Do you approve expenses?  Do you fire people?
>>>  Dilbert answers "No" to all three questions. Dilbert says, <<<
I'm a leader.  Not a manager.
>>> 
1995-01-22 * 
Dogbert holds a pointer and stands next to the caption, <<<
How Nature Protects Weak Products.
>>> The caption says, <<<
First, the engineer pads his schedule.
>>>  Dilbert and the Boss sit at a conference table.  The Boss asks, <<<
Six months?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
At least.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
One month to build the product and five months to play 'Doom' on my computer.
>>> The caption says, <<<
Then the manager pads the schedule as a clever negotiating ploy.
>>>  The Boss tells an executive, <<<
One year . . . Unless you add people to my tiny empire.
>>> The caption says, <<<
Then the vice president pads the schedule to avoid looking bad to the president.
>>>  The VP kisses the president's toes and says, <<<
Eighteen months.
>>> The caption says, <<<
Meanwhile, the sales people are making up numbers because nobody tells them anything.
>>>  A man tells a woman, <<<
Two months . . . And it solves every problem you have!
>>> The caption says, <<<
This causes the customers to develop irrational desire for the product.
>>>  A woman says into the phone, <<<
Give me the 'beta' test version in one month.
>>> The caption says, <<<
Thus nature disguises weak products as 'beta.'"  The woman looks at a device and says, <<<
Cardboard?  That's stupid.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Oh . . . Then it's beta.
>>> 
1995-01-21 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
I'm promoting you to team leader.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Do I get a raise?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
There's no extra money, just extra responsibility.  It's how we recognize our best people.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I thought all the good people leave for better companies.
>>>  The Boss walks away saying, <<<
That's another way to recognize them.
>>> 
1995-01-20 * 
Phil stands behind Dilbert's desk and waves his hand and his spoon.  Phil says, <<<
Come to the dark side, Dilbert.  Renounce engineering and become a manager.
>>>  Dilbert says angrily, <<<
NEVER!
>>> Looking over Dilbert's shoulder, Phil says, <<<
Your technical knowledge is getting stale.  You're becoming a generalist . . . take the easy path.
>>> Phil is holding a set of software boxes.  He says to Dilbert, <<<
I brought you a suite of applications that ll work together.
>>>  Dilbert yells, <<<
THAT'S UNNATURAL!!! BE GONE!!!

Dilbert walks outside with Liz.  Dilbert asks her, <<<
If I left engineering and became a manager would I be as sexy as I am now, Liz?
>>> Liz responds, <<<
I think it would decrease your sex appeal by 17&#037;.  But that's just a planning number.
>>> Dilbert and Liz sit on the couch.  Dilbert asks, <<<
What if I got my ham radio license to compensate for the loss?
>>>  Liz replies, <<<
Look at my arm: goose bumps.
>>> 
1995-01-18 * 
Dilbert sits on his couch and Dogbert sits on the armrest.  Dilbert says, <<<
I can't decide if I should stay with engineering or pursue a career in management.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
In my heart I'm an engineer but I hear a voice calling me to the dark side.
>>> Dogbert looks behind the couch and sees a man dressed as a devil.  Dogbert says, <<<
I found your problem.
>>>  The devil says, <<<
Boy is my face red.
>>> 
1995-01-17 * 
The Boss sees Dilbert carrying a stack of paper and says, <<<
We've all noticed the volume of work you carry around.  Your quiet leadership inspires us.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I'd like to promote you to manager so you can imbue others with your work ethic.
>>> At home, Dilbert loads the paper into the furnace while Dogbert watches.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Does he know you use the documents to heat our house?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
No.  And I asked him to put the job offer in writing.
>>> 
1995-01-16 * 
Dilbert installs a stove while Dogbert watches.  Dilbert says, <<<
I'm installing a paper-burning stove to lower our heating bills.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'll fuel it with all the useless documents I get at work.
>>> At the office, the Boss sees Dilbert carrying a stack of papers and asks, <<<
I've been noticing how much stuff you take home.  You must love your work.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
It gives me a warm feeling.
>>> 
1995-01-15 * 
Wally, Dilbert, Alice and the Boss sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Our new philosophy is 'We do it right the first time.'
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
This will inspire you to higher quality because you'll realize mistakes are not tolerated.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Question.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Since mistakes are inevitable, wouldn't your philosophy 
1995-01-14 * 
Dogbert sits at his desk and a businessman sits across from him.  Reading from a document, Dogbert says, <<<
I'll invest up to five million dollars if you'll agree to some standard conditions.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I will be chairman of the board and own 99&#037; of the company.  You will work for free and wash my car twice a week.
>>> The businessman asks, <<<
Can I mow your lawn instead of washing your car?
>>>  Dogbert answers, <<<
You're a tough bargainer, but I prefer multimedia developers for my gardening needs.
>>> 
1995-01-13 * 
Dogbert sits in a restaurant with a businessman.  The businessman says, <<<
My idea is to develop a word processing program for Windows.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
That's an interesting concept.  I wonder if twenty dollars would be enough.
>>> The businessman asks, <<<
To start a software company?
>>>  Dogbert answers, <<<
No, to pay our waitress to beat you with a loaf of French bread.
>>>  The waitress enters carrying a loaf of bread. 
1995-01-12 * 
Dogbert sits at a conference table with a businessman.  Dogbert says, <<<
You'll use your technical expertise and I'll do the business stuff.  Sign here.
>>> As the businessman signs the contract Dogbert says, <<<
Since you're the inventor of the technology, you'll get 100&#037; of the special decorative non-equity stock.  I'll settle for all the common stock.
>>> The businessman says, <<<
I hope we can avoid the tension that some partners experience.
>>>  Dogbert says angrily, <<<
Give me my pen, you miscreant.
>>> 
1995-01-11 * 
Dilbert lies on his couch and Dogbert sits on the backrest.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm starting my own venture capital firm.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I'm attracted to the concept of watching people with moronic ideas beg for money.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Will you actually finance anybody?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
That would sort of crimp the mirth.
>>> 
1995-01-10 * 
Dilbert enters carrying a briefcase and meets Wally who is pushing a shopping cart.  Wally says, <<<
Now that we don't have our own cubicles I have to keep my binders in this shopping cart.
>>> Wally draws on a cubicle wall with a can of spray paint and says, <<<
And I've developed a strong interest in graffiti as a way to express my individuality.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Well . . . It could be worse.
>>>  Wally continues, <<<
I'm thinking of joining a gang.
>>> 
1995-01-09 * 
The Boss stands next to an overhead projector.  He points to the diagram on the screen and says, <<<
We're taking away your individual cubicles.  In the new system, you'll sign up for whatever cube is open that day.
>>> Sally and Wally are seated at a conference table.  The Boss continues, <<<
It's based on the model of public restrooms.  But I call it 'Hoteling' because it increases my chances of getting tips.
>>> The Boss approaches Dilbert with a roll of note paper that looks like toilet paper and says, <<<
Each cubicle will have a computer, a chair, and a roll of note paper . . . Take one and pass it around.
>>> 
1995-01-08 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  The Boss peers around the corner and says, <<<
Congratulations!
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
You've been named 'floor warden.'
>>> The Boss explains, <<<
In the event of a fire we'll rely on your leadership to get us out safely.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Let me see if I understand this . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
YOU're the leader when it involves uninformed decisions in return for huge stock options.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But I'M the leader when it comes to rishing death in a highrise inferno while you scramble over the ashen backs of fallen co-workers.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What makes you think your life is worth more than mine?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
I've got stock options and you're a floor warden.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Don't expect any CPR.
>>> 
1995-01-07 * 
Dilbert is seated at his desk and Ratbert stands on the desk beside him.  Dilbert shows Ratbert something in his palm and says, <<<
Look Ratbert.  An entire computer has been baked into one silicon chip.
>>> Ratbert grabs the chip and eats it, saying, <<<
Thanks!  I don't mind if I do!
>>> Dilbert says angrily, <<<
You ate my computer!
>>>  Ratbert holds his arms out straight, stares ahead and replies, <<<
I'm a cyborg.
>>> 
1995-01-06 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk.  Reading a report, the Boss says, <<<
Change these dates . . . and add six more meetings and use the phrase 'customer focus.'
>>> Dilbert looks down at the desk where a tiny figure has appeared.  Dilbert says, <<<
Uh-Oh . . . your micro-management has caused my ego to manifest itself and beg for survival.
>>>  The tiny figure says, <<<
I'm shrinking!
>>> The Boss splats the tiny figure with a fly swatter and says to Dilbert, <<<
Run and get me some paper towels . . . five of them . . . from the men's room.
>>> 
1995-01-05 * 
Wally hands a piece of paper to Dilbert and says, <<<
Be at the 'United Charity' kickoff tomorrow.
>>> While Dilbert reads the paper Wally says, <<<
I hired a headless man to be our inspirational speaker.
>>> Wally, Sally and the Boss are seated and a headless man stands in front of them with a microphone, making a speech.  The headless man says, <<<
. . . and that's how 'United Charity' game me back my dignity.  Any questions?
>>>  The Boss raises his hand and asks, <<<
How do you show up on a headcount report?
>>> 
1995-01-04 * 
Wally stands in front of Dilbert who is seated at his desk.  Wally is reading a piece of paper and says to Dilbert, <<<
Your contributions to 'United Charity' are below average for your pay level.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Actually, I donate ten percent of my income and thousands of hours to local groups not on your approved list.
>>> Wally writes on the sheet, <<<
. . . Not a team player.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I fund an agency that keeps people like you away from society.
>>> 
1995-01-03 * 
The Boss stands with his arm on Wally's shoulder.  The Boss says, <<<
Congratulations, Wally.  I've selected you to head up our campaign for 'United Charity.'
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I chose you not only because you're the least valuable member of our group, but also because you're so darn pitiful.
>>>  Wally looks distraught and clutches his tie. The Boss walks away thinking, <<<
Honesty is the best policy unless it's being done to you.
>>> 
1995-01-02 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss who is seated at his desk. Dilbert says, <<<
I accomplished twice as much as Wally this year, but we got exactly the same tiny raises.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm wondering if this is a clever shift in management philosophy or a simple application of your ignorance?
>>> The boss says, <<<
You're starting to annoy me.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
And that would affect my pay how?
>>> 
1995-01-01 * 
Dilbert stands next to Wally's desk and says, <<<
Wally, you never really answered the question I left on your voicemail.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Is this a case of simple incompetence or a preview of something far more sinster?
>>> Wally replies, <<<
It's the sinister one.
>>> Wally explains, <<<
I've adopted a defensive strategy.  I'm withholding information to make myself appear more valuable.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Now I only return phone calls late at night and leave incomplete answers.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
In person, I act overworked and irrational so people stop asking questions.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
If cornered, I sigh deeply and recount old war stories that don't relate to the question.
>>> Wally concludes, <<<
No co-worker can thwart me!
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
What if they team up?
>>>  Behind Wally's back, Alice reaches over the wall and grabs Wally's CPU.  She thinks, <<<
Got it!
>>> 
1994-12-31 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, Wally and Alice, <<<
I'm going to make your group a 'self-managed team.'
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
All of the vital management tasks that I've been doing will now be shared among you.
>>> Dilbert says to Wally and Alice, <<<
Stop your work and give me a status report.
>>>  Alice says, <<<
Track your time.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I think I'll kiss some butts.
>>> 
1994-12-30 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, Wally and Alice, <<<
I've decided that our next team-building exercise will be a paintball tournament.
>>> Alice, Wally and Dilbert think, <<<
This is not a good thing.
>>> The Boss stands outside Dilbert's cubicle holding a paintball gun and wearing goggles.  He peers around the doorway and thinks, <<<
It's a deceptively easy sport.
>>> 
1994-12-29 * 
Dogbert and Ratbert sit on the couch armrest.  Dogbert says, <<<
Remember the old saying, Ratbert: you can lead a horse to water . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
. . . But by the time you got there you'd smell like a horse and your butt would hurt.
>>> Ratbert asks, <<<
If you stuck a hose in a horse's mouth and taped it there, could you make the horse drink?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Yeah, I've tried it.
>>> 
1994-12-28 * 
The Boss, Dilbert and a man with an eye patch sit at a conference table.  The man says, <<<
Sure, we could bring some strangers in to test out product for ease of use . . .
>>> The man continues, <<<
But that could take all afternoon and cost at least a hundred dollars.
>>> The man continues, <<<
And all it proves is strangers are stupid.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Sometimes they have good candy.
>>> 
1994-12-27 * 
Dilbert stands behind a man with an eye patch who is working on his computer.  The man says, <<<
My theory is that a computer interface should hurt the user.
>>> The man continues, <<<
So I designed some new sounds into our product.  We've got 'sound of puking,' 'fingernails on blackboard' and 'bird hitting window.'"  Dilbert looks ill. The man continues, <<<
But suppose the user does something WRONG.  Then we have the sound of a puking bird hitting a blackboard.
>>>  Dilbert falls down. 
1994-12-26 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
I hired a professional to help us design our product interface.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
His last job was as an international terrorist.  It's not a perfect fit but he went to Yale.
>>> Dilbert sits at a table and says to the man sitting with him, <<<
So, I hear you went to Yale, Sven.
>>>  Sven answers, <<<
I yust got out last week.
>>> 
1994-12-25 * 
Dilbert says to a co-worker, <<<
It's seven o'clock, Ed.  Time to call it a night.
>>> Ed replies, <<<
I'm planning to work all night.
>>> Ed explains, <<<
I'm not very bright so I work long hours to compensate.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Ed, we're not better off when you do extra work.
>>> Ed says, <<<
I'm not quite following your logic.
>>> Alice and Wally stand behind Dilbert.  Dilbert says, <<<
We all worked late undoing what you did yesterday.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
We voted to duct-tape you to your chair.
>>> As they tape Ed to his chair, Alice says, <<<
It's uncanny how many problems you can solve with duct tape.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Sometimes I use it instead of underwear.
>>> 
1994-12-24 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk and says, <<<
There's a strange smell in the cubes.
>>>  The Boss responds, <<<
We're using aroma technology!
>>> The Boss explains, <<<
For example, research shows that the scent of lemon makes employees more alert.
>>> Dilbert sniffs the air and says, <<<
That's not lemon.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
My job's easier when you guys aren't too alert.
>>> 
1994-12-23 * 
Dogbert sits across from the Boss's desk.  He hands the Boss a document and says, <<<
Here's my bid to run your telemarketing company.  Basically, it's no cost to you.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
My telemarketers pay themselves.  If they get a feeble-minded person on the phone they charge them triple and pocket the difference.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
There's no way I can lose.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Don't answer your home phone for a few weeks.
>>> 
1994-12-22 * 
Dilbert hands the Boss a report and says, <<<
I finished our write-up for the national Millard Bullrush 'Quality' Contest.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It took two weeks of otherwise productive time, and everything but our address is a lie.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Do you know what irony is?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
I send my shirts to a service.
>>> 
1994-12-21 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the table.  Dilbert works on a laptop and says to Dogbert, <<<
I have to submit my project for a 'quality' award.  I'll need your help on the dishonest parts.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
The real story is that the project lost its budget because its acronym was similar to a project that was canceled.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Assume your project would have failed and claim the savings from avoiding it.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
You're spooky.
>>> 
1994-12-20 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  The Boss enters and says, <<<
Describe how you used 'total quality' methods on your last project.  We're applying for the Millard Bullrush Quality Award.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You know I didn't use 'total quality.'  I'd have to lie.
>>> The Boss responds, <<<
Sadly, Millard passed away before he could invent the Millard Bullrush 'Honesty' Award.
>>> 
1994-12-19 * 
The Boss, Wally and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
The company has decided to compete for the 'Millard Bullrush Quality Award.'
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Bullrush?  Isn't he the politician who went snorkeling and got killed by a sea turtle?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
They're faster than they look.
>>>  Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
I think we can win this.
>>> 
1994-12-18 * 
The caption says, <<<
Dogbert teaches business math.
>>>  Dogbert points to a diagram of an equation.  A picture of Wally, Dilbert and Alice illustrates the equation, <<<
Grunts equals zero.
>>> The caption says, <<<
#1. Any job that can be done by two people . . .
>>>  The Boss stands behind two people. The caption continues, <<<
. . . Can be done by one person for half the cost.
>>>  The Boss yanks one of the workers out of his chair. The caption says, <<<
#2. A bonus today is worth more than . . .
>>>  The Boss holds a large bag of money. The caption continues, <<<
. . . The whole company tomorrow.
>>>  An office building has a closed sign on it. The caption says, <<<
#3. Your expense requirements for December can be calculated . . .
>>>  The Boss sits at his desk writing on a piece of paper. The caption continues, <<<
. . . By taking what's left in the budget and multiplying by one.
>>>  A delivery person asks the Boss, <<<
Giraffe goes where?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Next week, a doctor with a flashlight shows us where sales projections come from.
>>> 
1994-12-17 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Alice, Ratbert and Ted sit at a conference table.  Ratbert asks, <<<
Excuse me . . . I'm only an intern, but may I make a suggestion?
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
Let's form multidisciplinary task forces to reengineer our core processes until we're a world class organization!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Sounds good.  Go do it.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
I'm more of an idea rat.
>>> 
1994-12-16 * 
Dilbert sits in his desk chair and says to Ratbert, <<<
Since you won't go away, I'll make you an intern.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
Great!  What's an intern?
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
You'll spend your day in a high-traffic cube trying to look busy.  Your main function is to make the rest of us glad we're not you.
>>> As he sits in a cubicle moving a mouse Ratbert thinks, <<<
How did people ever look busy before computers?
>>> 
1994-12-15 * 
Ratbert arrives at home carrying a briefcase and says to Dogbert, <<<
I didn't get the job in marketing.  They say I have no experience.
>>> Dogbert responds, <<<
Try inviting yourself to meetings.  Nobody ever says no, and they're too timid to kick you out once you sit down.
>>> Wally, Dilbert and Alice sit at a conference table.  Ratbert stands on the table next to a box of donuts and says, <<<
Does anybody want to split a donut?  I'll just take half and leave the rest.
>>> 
1994-12-14 * 
Ratbert sits across from a desk and says, <<<
Outwardly, yes, I'm a rat.  But my bubbly personality and my utter lack of skill make me well-suited for a career in marketing.
>>> Ratbert asks, <<<
Would you mind terribly if I gnawed on your phone cord?
>>> The person at the desk says, <<<
We have an opening in lobby security.
>>>  Ratbert holds the phone cord in his mouth and says, <<<
I'm insulted!
>>> 
1994-12-13 * 
Ratbert walks behind Dilbert who is carrying a briefcase.  Ratbert says, <<<
I'm following you to work.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
I'll start out as an annoying rodent but with hard work and training I'll work my way up to engineer.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
May I suggest a career in marketing?
>>>  Ratbert holds up his tiny briefcase and says, <<<
Is this the cutest little briefcase or what?!
>>> 
1994-12-12 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  A man wearing a mask and goggles and holding some equipment says, <<<
I'm checking the building for environmental hazards.
>>> The man holds up an instrument and asks, <<<
Have you been feeling tired, nervous and disoriented?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You just described my entire career.
>>>  The man says, <<<
If you start feeling good, run for the exit.
>>> 
1994-12-11 * 
Dilbert, Wally, Alice, the Boss and another man sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
We've implemented an 'employee of the month award.'
>>> The Boss explains, <<<
The winner gets to park in a special space right behind the area reserved for managers!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's like saying the very best employee isn't as good as the worst manager.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
No, you're just as good but . . . Uh . . . Less important.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Personally, I'm feeling all charged up about this program!
>>> Wally continues, <<<
I'm going to work day and night to increase my chances for better parking!!
>>> Everyone except the Boss laughs. Wally says, <<<
But wait!  I ride the train to work!
>>>  The Boss thinks, <<<
We're off to a rocky start.
>>> 
1994-12-10 * 
The Boss says to an employee, <<<
The employee surveys indicate some dissatisfaction in my group.  That affects my pay.
>>> The Boss continues as the man frowns, <<<
You're my grumpiest employee, so I'm going to fire you to bring up my average score for morale.
>>> The Boss walks away thinking, <<<
I think I'm getting better at all the touchy-feely stuff.
>>> 
1994-12-09 * 
Dilbert and Alice watch as Dogbert points to a diagram and says, <<<
Your target market is the high income group.  They're the only ones who can afford your product.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
More specifically, they must be rich, tasteless and easily amused.  I've located a cluster of them to study.
>>> Dogbert stands behind a bush on a golf course and watches two golfers.  One golfer says, <<<
That dog's watching us golf again.
>>> 
1994-12-08 * 
Dilbert puts a transparency on an overhead projector and says, <<<
Here's the basic plan for getting our 'ISO 9000' certification.
>>> Dilbert points at the diagram and continues, <<<
Each of you will create an insanely boring, poorly written document.  I'll combine them into one big honkin' binder.
>>> Dilbert points to a picture of a man passing a binder to another man and continues, <<<
I'll send copies to all department heads for comment.  They will treat it like a dead raccoon and route it to the first passerby.
>>> 
1994-12-07 * 
Dilbert sits at a desk and says, <<<
Thank you for coming to the 'ISO 9000' project kick-off meeting.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Each of you was hand-picked by your manager for this project because . . .
>>> Dilbert faces a table of strange people and says, <<<
Well . . . never mind why.
>>> 
1994-12-06 * 
The Boss says, <<<
I'm putting you in charge of getting our 'ISO 9000' certification.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
We don't know what it is but it looks great on brochures.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I think it certifies that we follow a consistent process.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
That's us, we always lie on our brochures.
>>> 
1994-12-05 * 
The Boss and Dilbert sit at a table.  The Boss says, <<<
We've studied the Japanese model and decided to copy their best practices.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Long term investing?
>>>  The Boss holds up a microphone and yells, <<<
Karaoke!
>>> The Boss stands on the table and sings, <<<
Shaft!  Can you dig it?
>>>  Dilbert looks at the reader and says, <<<
Thank God we don't have lifetime employment.
>>> 
1994-12-04 * 
Dilbert tells Alice and Wally, <<<
We're waiting for Ted, then we can head for the restaurant.
>>> Wally says, <<<
While we're waiting, I'll return a few phone calls.
>>> Ted walks up and says, <<<
Let's go!  Hey, where's Wally?
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
The chain reaction has begun.
>>> Dilbert covers his eyes and thinks, <<<
Why can't we do this simple thing?
>>>  Alice says, <<<
I'll be in the ladies' room.
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Where's Alice?
>>>  Ted says, <<<
I've got to mail a letter.  I'll take my car and meet you there.
>>> Wally thinks, <<<
I can make some calls.
>>>  Dilbert yells at Ted, <<<
You're the only one who knows which restaurant we're going to!
>>> Ted replies, <<<
Alice knows where it is.  Tell her it's the one with the food.
>>> The Boss asks Dilbert, <<<
Has your team finished engineering the new missile guidance chip?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I think it's time to give peace a chance.
>>> 
1994-12-03 * 
Dogbert sits at a desk and says into the phone, <<<
So . . . There are three menu choices and the first two didn't work . . .
>>> Dogbert's continues, <<<
Some people would have recklessly tried the third choice before calling for help.  But I can tell you're different.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Let's be honest with ourselves, Dave.  Do you think anybody is going to read a memo from you?
>>> 
1994-12-02 * 
Dogbert sits at a desk and says into the phone, <<<
Please wait while I consult with somebody who has your exact same problem.
>>> Ratbert sits in the chair next to Dogbert.  Dogbert asks him, <<<
How do you compensate for a tiny brain, Ratbert?
>>>  Ratbert answers, <<<
I just say I'm way too busy to learn.  Then I get somebody else to do my work.
>>> Dilbert says into the phone, <<<
I'm going to transfer you to an expert.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
Sometimes I pretend to be dead.
>>> 
1994-12-01 * 
Dogbert sits at a desk using a computer.  He says into the phone, <<<
According to my online database, our product isn't compatible with your computer.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
It's also incompatible with all other computers and all other software including our own.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
And those red blotches on your hands - that's because our box is made of poison ivy.
>>> 
1994-11-30 * 
Dogbert sits at a desk and says into the phone, <<<
I think I know what your problem is . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Take all the parts and arrange them in neat piles.  Now stand on your chair so you can see above your cubicle wall.
>>> A man stands on his chair holding the phone and looking over the cubicle walls.  On the other end of the phone Dogbert continues, <<<
Now shout 'Does anybody know how to read a manual?'
>>> 
1994-11-29 * 
Dogbert sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
You submitted the lowest bid to run our new technical support hotline, Mister Dogbert.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
The other bidders would love to know how you plan to handle twelve thousand calls a day by yourself.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Tell them to call me.
>>> 
1994-11-28 * 
The Boss, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
We're changing the salary plan to make a bigger portion depend on the success of the team.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
We reason that if your pay depends on the success of co-workers, then your priorities will change.
>>>  Wally and Dilbert look at each other. Wally and Dilbert stand by the printer.  Wally looks at a document and says, <<<
Now THAT'S a pretty resume!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Stop hogging the good printer.
>>> 
1994-11-27 * 
The Boss tells Dilbert, <<<
I'm moving you to a cubicle in the south wing.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Why?
>>> The Boss answers, <<<
Umm . . . It's more efficient if my group is all in one place.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Not for me.  The people on my project team are all in this wing.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It will improve communication in our group.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
I don't need to communicate with my group.  I only need to work with my project team.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I'll bet another manager wants that same cubicle in the south wing.  I think I'm just a pawn in your little game.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You move tomorrow.  By the way, there's a new dress code.
>>> Dilbert and Wally wear chess pawn costumes.  Dilbert says, <<<
You're in my cubicle.
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
You can only move to a diagonal cubicle.
>>> 
1994-11-26 * 
The Boss, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I came up with a new name for our group.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
From now on we're the 'Engineering Science Research Technology Systems Information Quality and Excellence Center.'
>>> Wally says, <<<
You should throw 'efficiency' in there too.
>>>  The Boss holds up a long piece of paper and says, <<<
I designed the business cards myself.
>>> 
1994-11-25 * 
Liz sits on the couch and Dogbert sits on the armrest.  Dogbert says, <<<
Liz, if you're going to continue seeing Dilbert, you'll have to pass my test.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Question one: give seven hundred reasons why dogs are superior to cats.
>>> Liz pats Dogbert on the head and says, <<<
Well, the first six hundred reasons have to do with the fact that you're cuter.
>>>  Dogbert wags his tail and says, <<<
Fingernails!  She-devil!
>>> 
1994-11-24 * 
Dilbert, Alice and Wally stand in Ted's cubicle flicking their fingers.  Dilbert says, <<<
Look, Ted!  We get paid the same as you but all we're doing is standing around and flicking our fingers.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Come join us and flick your fingers in joyous celebration that our performance is not linked to our pay.
>>> The Boss sits at his desk listening to the flicking and thinks, <<<
I don't know what success sounds like, but I'll bet this isn't it.
>>> 
1994-11-23 * 
Dilbert walks down the hall thinking, <<<
I just lost the subtle mental connection between my performance and my salary.
>>> Dilbert continues thinking, <<<
I get paid the same no matter what I do.  I can stand here and flick my fingers and still get paid.
>>> As he flicks his fingers, Dilbert says to Alice and Wally, <<<
Do you realize what this means??!
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Hey!  You're getting paid for that!
>>> 
1994-11-22 * 
Dogbert and the Boss sit at a conference table.  Dogbert says, <<<
You can gauge your success by the number of repeat customers you have.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'm proud to say that virtually every customer gets another unit within three months of buying the first one!
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
What if you don't count warranty replacements?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Ooh . . . Then we don't look so good.
>>> 
1994-11-21 * 
Dogbert and the Boss sit at a conference table.  Dogbert says, <<<
A good way to judge corporate health is to look at your employee turnover rate.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Our turnover rate is very low.  We only hire people who aren't skilled enough to work anyplace else.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Maybe metrics aren't the way to go here.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
No metric has beaten me yet!!
>>> 
1994-11-20 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Let's go around the table and share our accomplishments.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I created a document this week.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But THIS is no ordinary document!
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
I bought a $500 desktop publishing program and took a two-day class to learn it.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I incorporated digitized photos and color highlights in a multi-column page layout!
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Clip-art icons are sprinkled liberally around the page to form a visual mosaic!
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Next week - God willing - I'll add a topic and some content.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Do you remember when I said you should enjoy your work?  I didn't mean it.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Ooh.
>>> 
1994-11-19 * 
Wally stands in front of the Boss's desk and says, <<<
I suddenly realized that MY job performance reflects on YOUR career.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
The balance of power has shifted.  Unless I get what I want, I'll lower my performance until you get fired.
>>> The Boss responds, <<<
Ha!  There's no way you could lower your job performance.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Curse your eyes!
>>> 
1994-11-18 * 
Wally stands in front of the Boss's desk and says, <<<
This is just great . . . We engineers have old IBM 286 PCs and you have a Sparc workstation.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the only thing you know how to do is stare at the screen saver.
>>> The Boss stares at the monitor and thinks, <<<
How does that ball keep bouncing?
>>>  Wally says as he walks away, <<<
If anybody needs me I'll be scrolling some text.
>>> 
1994-11-17 * 
The Boss, Wally and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Since implementing our 'paperless office' concept, we've saved . . .
>>> The Boss looks at a figure written on the back of his hand and says, <<<
Uh . . . ten percent!
>>> Wally looks at his arm and says, <<<
Next on the agenda: the restroom situation . . .
>>> 
1994-11-16 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk and says, <<<
Did you see my project report yet?  It's in a big thick binder.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
I'm using it as a footrest.
>>> Dilbert arrives at home carrying a briefcase and says to Dogbert, <<<
You never want to hear the words 'footrest' the day before your annual performance appraisal.
>>> 
1994-11-15 * 
Wally hands Dilbert a binder and says, <<<
I made a few thousand suggestions on your first draft.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Of all the pleasures of life, I think I like nit-picking the best!
>>> Dilbert takes the report and says, <<<
That could explain the break-up of your marriage.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
You wouldn't believe what SHE thought was fun.
>>> 
1994-11-14 * 
The Boss stands behind Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
I'm assigning you to 'The Project That Wouldn't Die.'
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Everybody likes this project too much to cancel it, but not enough to fund it properly.
>>>  Dilbert puts his hands over his eyes and says, <<<
Aaarg!!
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Now go out there and maintain the status quo!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
You really shouldn't mix honesty with your motivational speeches.
>>> 
1994-11-13 * 
The Boss stands in front of Alice, Dilbert and Al.  He says, <<<
I need to promote one of you to the district manager position.
>>> Dilbert, Al and Alice look at the Boss. The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, your technical knowledge is too valuable to lose.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Ditto for Alice.  Neither of you can be promoted.
>>> Dilbert and Alice look angry. The Boss says, <<<
The only logical choice is to promote Al because he has no valuable knowledge.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Al??!  A director??!  He doesn't know what day of the week it is!! The Boss tells Al, <<<
They're just grumpy because it's Monday.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
It's Thursday.
>>> 
1994-11-12 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally, Alice and Ted sit at a conference table.  The Boss hands around a box of donuts and says, <<<
One of these donuts contains a memo which fires the recipient.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
This seemed like the most humane way to reduce headcount.
>>> As they walk out of the conference room, Dilbert says, <<<
How was your donut?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
The first two were great.  The third was papery.
>>> 
1994-11-11 * 
The Boss, Dogbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  Dogbert says, <<<
I recommend letting the engineers order their own supplies without management approval.
>>> Wally yells, <<<
Yes!!!  I'm rich!!  Ha ha ha ha ha!!!
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
And I recommend buying 'Put' options in your stock.
>>>  Wally stands and says, <<<
Whoo!  Whoo!  Whoo!
>>> 
1994-11-10 * 
The Boss, Wally, Dilbert and Dogbert sit at a conference table.  Dogbert says, <<<
As your consultant, I'll tell you how to improve your business processes.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I'll show you how a well-designed process can compensate for your sloth, apathy and all-around incompetence.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
But most important: let's have fun.
>>> 
1994-11-09 * 
Wally stacks binders on his desk chair and tells Dilbert, <<<
. . . And if I pile enough binders on my chair I'll have a window view!
>>> Wally stands on his chair and looks over the cubicle wall.  Dilbert thinks as he walks away, <<<
I've got to try that.
>>> The Boss hands Ted a binder and says, <<<
Wow!  I've never seen so much interest in our business plan!
>>>  Ted asks, <<<
Can I have two?
>>>  Behind them, Dilbert, Wally and their co-workers stand on their chairs looking out of their cubicles. 
1994-11-08 * 
Wally and a man stand in line at the blood drive.  The man says, <<<
I don't mind donating blood . . . It's good for society . . .
>>> The man continues, <<<
But I'm worried that our company is getting too competitive about how much we give compared to other companies.
>>> Dilbert leaves the blood drive saying, <<<
Man, I'm thirsty!!
>>>  His head and body have shrunk to half their normal size. 
1994-11-07 * 
The Boss, Wally, Dilbert, Alice and a man sit at a conference table.  The man says, <<<
This job has taken my dignity, my self-esteem, my creativity and my precious time on this earth.
>>> The man continues, <<<
You've taken all I have!  There's nothing left to give!!!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The blood drive is next week.  This year it's mandatory . . . And a three-pint minimum.
>>> 
1994-11-06 * 
The Boss stands at Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
I got your project approved by our president!
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
But he gave your budget to another project.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It's pretty much doomed from the get-go.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
But I hyped it up at the executive meeting so somebody else will try to take it over.
>>> A woman pushes them aside and says, <<<
Step aside, fools!  This project belongs to marketing now!
>>> As the woman walks away, the Boss says, <<<
Oh, please don't take our project.
>>> Dilbert and the Boss slap hands.  Dilbert says, <<<
Yes!
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Do you ever worry that you're finding joy in the wrong places?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Nope.
>>> 
1994-11-05 * 
Dilbert, Wally and a man sit at a table eating lunch.  The man says, <<<
Instead of 'right-sizing' our company is 'bright-sizing.'  That's when all the bright people leave!
>>> They all laugh. They stop laughing and Dilbert says, <<<
Hey!  We all brought bananas.
>>> 
1994-11-04 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
I've decided to manage by physical intimidation.  If somebody says something stupid I'll just smack them.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
>>> The Boss hits himself in the head.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
On the other hand, maybe I should give it a chance.
>>> 
1994-11-03 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
I'm starting an interdisciplinary task force to study our decision-making process.
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
So, you're using a bad decision-making process to decide how to fix our bad decision-making process?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I don't know how else we could find the source of our problem.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
X-ray your skull?
>>> 
1994-11-02 * 
The Boss, Wally and Dilbert sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
The employee survey showed that 95&#037; of the company believes we have no consistent strategy.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
So the executives formed a 'quality team' to determine the root cause of the problem.
>>> A man points to a chart and says to three people seated at a table, <<<
We've narrowed it down to either 'employees are ninnies' or 'we deserve more stock options.'
>>> 
1994-11-01 * 
The Boss points to a diagram and says, <<<
Problem: our product development process requires buy-in from managers who'd be happier if we all died.
>>> As he puts a new transparency on the overhead projector, the Boss says, <<<
My solution is to create executive oversight groups who don't understand the issues and don't have time to meet.
>>> Wally and Dilbert watch as the Boss looks into the light and yells, <<<
I'm . . . I'm blind!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
You looked directly at the bulb again.
>>> 
1994-10-31 * 
What's in the jar?
>>>
1994-10-30 * 
<<<
Exhibit 'A' is my empty lunch bag, last seen full.
>>>
 <<<
Only the people in this room had the motive and the opportunity.
>>>
 <<<
Inspector Dogbert will investigate.
>>>
 <<<
Sniff.  You were in the mail room with Willy the mail boy all morning.  You are innocent.
>>>
 <<<
Sort of.
>>>
 <<<
Sniff.  I give you a 'C+' for hygiene but you did not take the lunch.
>>>
 <<<
Sniff.  Bologna...potato chips...carrot sticks...ha!!!
>>>
 <<<
This is the thief who took the decoy lunch...which we laced with synthetic female hormones!
>>>
 <<<
You can't prove anything!
>>>
 <<<
Is there something you'd like to get off your chest?
>>>
1994-10-29 * 
Have you started to hate the new finance guy yet?
>>>
1994-10-28 * 
Ray's our new finance guy.  He's got a face that makes you hate him automatically.
>>>
1994-10-27 * 
<<<
Dogbert: Ethics Advisor
>>>
 <<<
We mail our product to people and tell them it's free for one year.
>>>
 <<<
Then we start nailing them with high fees because they'll forget the procedure for returning the product.  They're trapped.
>>>
 <<<
So, did you have some ethics advice?
>>>
 <<<
No.  I asked you here so I can return your stupid product.
>>>
1994-10-26 * 
<<<
Dogbert: Ethics Advisor
>>>
 <<<
We know our products are killing people, but we're claiming the studies are flawed.
>>>
 <<<
We're planning to focus our advertising on the youth markets in poor urban areas.
>>>
 <<<
So, given all that, is it okay for me to steal office supplies?
>>>
 <<<
I'd have to say yes.
>>>
1994-10-25 * 
<<<
I have a question for the Ethics office.
>>>
 <<<
If my co-worker has a 'pentium' pc and I have a 386, is it okay to run over his foot in the parking lot?
>>>
 <<<
It seemed like a long-shot when I asked.
>>>
1994-10-24 * 
<<<
The company hired an ethics expert to help us through the gray areas.
>>>
 <<<
Your calls to the ethics office are completely confidential.
>>>
 <<<
Thanks for sharing that.  I own you now, Weasel-boy.
>>>
1994-10-23 * 
<<<
Our project is six months behind schedule.
>>>
 <<<
Meanwhile, our technology has become obsolete and the users' requirements have changed.
>>>
 <<<
Any suggestions?
>>>
 <<<
Let's stubbornly plod along and deliver the useless product that was originally requested.
>>>
 <<<
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard!
>>>
 <<<
We should restart every time something changes.  That way we'll never be held accountable for results!
>>>
 <<<
You losers can work it out alone.  I heard there's a job opening on project Caribou.
>>>
 <<<
Next on the agenda: our weekly team-building excercise.
>>>
 
>>>
1994-10-22 * 
<<<
To configure the software, enter the name of next year's academy award winner for best actor.
>>>
 <<<
Please wait.
>>>
1994-10-21 * 
It looks like you're off to a three-hour staff meeting that doesn't apply to me.
>>>
1994-10-20 * 
<<<
Great news -- You're fired!
>>>
 <<<
You get a generous severance package, two weeks' vacation, AND we hire you back as a contractor for more money!!
>>>
 <<<
And I can telecommute if I want, but since dress codes don't apply to me...
>>>
 <<<
Aargh!
>>>
 <<<
Bonk, Bonk
>>>
1994-10-19 * 
<<<
I've been asked to reduce headcount.
>>>
 <<<
To be fair about it I created a scientific algorithm to decide who goes.
>>>
 <<<
I thought you were firing the people with the highest salaries.
>>>
 <<<
Okay, maybe 'algorithm' is an overstatement.
>>>
1994-10-18 * 
Executive Board Room 
1994-10-17 * 
I put together a time line for your project.
>>>
1994-10-16 * 
<<<
I just had my annual meeting with our Vice President.
>>>
 <<<
We decided to combine your project with Project 'Bigfoot' because they're basically the same.
>>>
 <<<
They're not the same!  It only seems like it to you because you don't understand either project!
>>>
 <<<
Oh, well.  It's too late to do anything.  I told him they were the same.
>>>
 <<<
Just call him and say you were wrong.
>>>
 <<<
I can see why you're not in management.
>>>
 <<<
The logical solution is to wait for the next budget cut and eliminate your project, thus solving two problems.
>>>
 <<<
There's nothing more dangerous than a resourceful idiot.
>>>
1994-10-15 * 
I've given up on the whole dating scene.  I've decided to reproduce by asexual cell division.
>>>
1994-10-14 * 
<<<
I can predict the future by assuming that money and male hormones are the driving forces for new technology.
>>>
 <<<
Therefore, when virtual reality gets cheaper than dating, society is doomed.
>>>
 <<<
Year 2004
>>>
 <<<
Is Dilbert available?
>>>
 <<<
He's been in the holodeck since March.
>>>
1994-10-13 * 
<<<
Dogbert the Futurist
>>>
 <<<
Society will become divided into technology 'haves' and 'have nots'.
>>>
 <<<
Eventually the two groups will take different evolutionary paths.
>>>
 <<<
Then, as now, the 'have nots' will be the policy makers.
>>>
 <<<
Oog make mission statement.
>>>
1994-10-12 * 
<<<
Dogbert the Futurist
>>>
 <<<
Someday, keyboards will be replaced by motion-sensing rings on your fingers...
>>>
 <<<
The computer screen will be projected into your glasses as a 3-D image.
>>>
 <<<
These developments will not enhance the image of technical professionals.
>>>
 <<<
Are you an engineer?
>>>
 <<<
I'm a moron.  Common mistake.
>>>
1994-10-11 * 
I'm writing a book of my guesses about future trends.
>>>
1994-10-10 * 
I predict sales to be nothing for two years and then take a sudden surge.
>>>
1994-10-09 * 
<<<
I brought Dilbert, in case you have any technical questions about our product.
>>>
 <<<
Heh-heh...engineers don't know how to lie.  The truth will be mine.
>>>
 <<<
Uh-oh.
>>>
 <<<
Ted said your product is bug-free.  Is that true Dilbert?
>>>
 <<<
Well, yes, that's true.
>>>
 <<<
I mean, basically true.  Technicaly true.  Sort of.
>>>
 <<<
No-o-o!!  It's a lie!  All the bugs were reclassified as security features just to make the ship date!!
>>>
 <<<
And we both think you could be attractive if you'd just do SOMETHING with your hair.
>>>
 <<<
Why did I bring you along?
>>>
 <<<
The evidence suggests that you're stupid.
>>>
1994-10-08 * 
Two people in a focus group loved our product.  So we're doubling our production.
>>>
1994-10-07 * 
<<<
I've never managed marketing people before.  But a good manager can manage anything.
>>>
 <<<
So...I order you to go do marketing things...like segmenting and focus groups...
>>>
 <<<
And keep focusing and segmenting until we dominate the industry!!!
>>>
 <<<
Well, I'm motivated.
>>>
1994-10-06 * 
<<<
In addition to my current duties, I'll be managing the marketing group.
>>>
 <<<
The marketing job opened because the previous manager got run down in the parking lot.
>>>
 <<<
When they needed a good manager, they knew where to look.
>>>
 <<<
Under your bumper?
>>>
1994-10-05 * 
I decided to cut your project funding in half but keep the objectives the same.
>>>
1994-10-04 * 
<<<
How's the job going, Anne?
>>>
 <<<
Much better now that I've given up sleep, excercise and nutrition in favor of coffee.
>>>
 <<<
Any adverse effects?
>>>
 <<<
This is the aorta of the last person who asked me that.
>>>
1994-10-03 * 
<<<
The Dogbert Consulting Company has reviewed the Executive Compensation Plan as you requested.
>>>
 <<<
My conclusion is that you're already hideously overpaid.  I'm recommending ninety percent pay cuts and a whack in the head for each of you.
>>>
 <<<
I'll bet you don't get much repeat business.
>>>
 <<<
Oh yeah, as if I'd want to spend mroe time with you.
>>>
1994-10-02 * 
<<<
Dogbert!  Come here!  I've done it!
>>>
 <<<
I created a mathematical proof of the existence of God!
>>>
 <<<
Give it to me.
>>>
 <<<
This is a job for the world's smartest garbage man.
>>>
 <<<
What can I do for you, Dogbert?
>>>
 <<<
Check this math.
>>>
 <<<
Clever...but he transposed some variables.  This proves the existence of his dog.
>>>
 <<<
Now we know YOU exist and I must exist because 'I think, therefore I am'.
>>>
 <<<
But since Dilbert wasn't thinking when he made his error, there's no proof that HE exists.
>>>
 <<<
Hey!
>>>
 <<<
Did you just hear something, Dogbert?
>>>
 <<<
There's no way to be sure.
>>>
1994-10-01 * 
Wally?  I thought you got fired.
>>>
1994-09-30 * 
<<<
We could design the product with a simple point - and - click interface...
>>>
 <<<
Or we could require the user to choose among thousands of poorly documented commands, each of which must be typed exactly right on the first try.
>>>
 <<<
Bear in mind, we'll never meet a customer ourselves.
>>>
 <<<
Make it so they have to reboot after every typo.
>>>
1994-09-29 * 
Our new strategy is to make defective products and charge for technical support.
>>>
1994-09-28 * 
This cartoon seems to be saying that management decisions are a joke.
>>>
1994-09-27 * 
I'm running late.  But since I'm a vice president you'll have to wait in the hallway.
>>>
1994-09-26 * 
<<<
I invited Saint Dogbert to bludgeon anybody who strays from the agenda into something stupid.
>>>
 <<<
That reminds me of the productization of our Tiger Team's priority matrix.
>>>
 <<<
Actually, that was on the agenda.
>>>
 <<<
Oops.  Carry on.
>>>
1994-09-25 * 
<<<
It has come to my attention that you used the fax for personal business.
>>>
 <<<
I sent the fax during lunch.  It was a local call.
>>>
 <<<
You're using up all of our fax paper.
>>>
 <<<
No, I sent a fax.  The paper doesn't travel through the phone lines.
>>>
 <<<
It doesn't?
>>>
 <<<
You used the company's electricity.
>>>
 <<<
I had a friend fax us a wad of extra electricity.
>>>
 <<<
I'm using it right now to power my pc.
>>>
 <<<
Did you get any extra electricity?  My pc is out.
>>>
 <<<
Press the button on the back and I'll fax you some.
>>>
1994-09-24 * 
<<<
I filled out the confidential questionnaire about your style of management.
>>>
 <<<
I hope it's useful for that management class you're taking.  Only your instructor sees those, right?
>>>
 <<<
Right.
>>>
 <<<
I think I played that about right.
>>>
 <<<
Ooh, good marks!  And it says he trusts me too!
>>>
1994-09-23 * 
I hired Bob the Dinosaur to beat you with his tail until you give me the project requirements.
>>>
1994-09-22 * 
<<<
The project requirements are forming in my mind.
>>>
 <<<
Now they're changing...changing...changing...changing...okay.  No, wait...changing...changing...done.
>>>
 <<<
Naturally, I won't be sharing any of these thoughts with engineering.
>>>
 <<<
I budgeted some goons to beat it out of you.
>>>
1994-09-21 * 
At the Trade Show...
>>>
1994-09-20 * 
Trade Show Registration 
1994-09-19 * 
I'm going to the big technology show.
>>>
1994-09-18 * 
<<<
Remember, it's not a pyramid scam, it's a marketing breakthrough!
>>>
 <<<
The beauty of it is a new recruit is born every minute.
>>>
 <<<
Are we guaranteed to become amazingly wealthy?
>>>
 <<<
While being our own boss?
>>>
 <<<
Yes, unless you're lazy or ethical.
>>>
 <<<
Each person you recruit pays you one thousand dollars.  The recruits get their own recruits and charge them TWO thousand, and so on.
>>>
 <<<
Eventually, every person on Earth will be giving you money.  And that adds up.
>>>
 <<<
You can't argue with the math.
>>>
 <<<
I feel like we're a big family.
>>>
 <<<
The best part is that every person on Earth will get rich!
>>>
 <<<
Actually, the last recruit kinda gets it in the shorts.
>>>
1994-09-17 * 
<<<
This item will require your usual executive-style decision.
>>>
 <<<
You know:  keep it on your desk for three weeks, then sneak it back to my cubicle with an illegible question scrawled in the margin.
>>>
 <<<
Or, for your convenience, I have made no copies; so you can lose the original and claim you gave it back to me.
>>>
 <<<
Hmm
>>>
1994-09-16 * 
<<<
You have to go, Cat.  You have no value to us.
>>>
 <<<
Actually, my mere existence will widen your demographic appeal and makeyou immortal.
>>>
 <<<
Oh...a Cat.  That's original.
>>>
 <<<
Give it a rest, 'Mickey'.
>>>
1994-09-15 * 
<<<
Get off of my keyboard, Cat, or else!

Watch me act like I don't even hear you.

You're not welcome here, Cat.  It's against house rules to eat Ratbert.

My work here is not done until I have pounced on my natural enemy.

Who are you, and what are you doing on my keyboard?

1994-09-13 *

Bob, I'll yank the cat off of Ratbert's head and you stomp on it!

It's Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light.
>>>
 <<<
What's in your hands?
>>>
 <<<
I'm just borrowing some paper for the laser printer.  There's no law against that!
>>>
 <<<
I think we both know that the copier paper and the printer paper are purchased and tracked separately.
>>>
 <<<
You've made a mockery of the system!  I darn you to heck!
>>>
 <<<
Your punishment is to sit at the secretary's cubicle and endure the stale wit of your co-workers.

Hey, Wendy, there's something different about you today!

1994-09-10 * 
Work harder or I'll have you put in the 'box'.

This chart shows the decision process we're using for my project.
>>>
 <<<
Here we're wasting money.  Then someone said, 'hey, let's create a complicated chart.'  Now we're at this meeting, talking about the chart.
>>>
 <<<
I have a question.
>>>
 <<<
Great...there goes the plan.
>>>
1994-09-08 * 
<<<
I'd like a job where I can telecommute every day.
>>>
 <<<
It should be high-paying yet have goals which can't be measured.
>>>
 <<<
So, you'd stay home and we'd mail you checks?
>>>
 <<<
I was hoping for direct deposit.

We'll be getting a new 'Bungee Boss' sometime today.

People are so stupid they should pay me to listen to their opinions.
>>>
 <<<
If you disagree, you can call my phone poll at 555-Dog-BERT.  Each call costs two dollars.
>>>
 <<<
I'm voting twice.
>>>
1994-09-05 * 
<<<
From now on, I'm going to charge anybody who gives me their opinion.
>>>
 <<<
People are idiots.  If I have to listen to their opinions, I deserve compensation.

You're forgetting that 'from the mouths of babes...comes...something good.

You're probably noticing how soft and cute I am.

 <<<
Awww!  You're adorable!  Let me give you a little pat on the head.
>>>
 <<<
I couldn't.  I'm too shy.
>>>
 <<<
Shy?  That is just so cute.  I have to pet you now.
>>>
 <<<
Come here, you little tease!  You know you like it!

Don't you understand the word 'no'?!

I don't know how you do it.  You work all day and now you take classes at night.

It's hard, but you're gaining knowledge that couldn't be obtained any other way.

Hey!  I can hold eleven 'cheerios' in my nose!

And it's knowledge you can apply.

Let's start with a brief refresher in macro economics.
>>>
1994-08-31 * 
<<<
I'd stay and work some unpaid overtime with you but I'm taking MBA classes.
>>>
 <<<
If YOU took MBA classes you'd understand that working for free is a low NPV.
>>>
 <<<
If you don't mind, before big tests I'd like to rub your head for luck.
>>>
 <<<
It'll cost you a nickel.
>>>
1994-08-30 * 
<<<
I'm going to take classes at night and get an MBA.
>>>
 <<<
I don't need a big-name school.  I'm in this for knowledge, not prestige.
>>>
 <<<
How about 'Tony's House of MBA's'?
>>>
 <<<
The babe ratio is better at 'MBA-O-RAMA'.
>>>
1994-08-29 * 
<<<
I want all of you to prepare reports explaining why your jobs shouldn't be outsourced to consultants.
>>>
 <<<
It is my job to write this report.  But if I were a consultant it would make no sense to compare me to myself.  Outsourcing is illogical.
>>>
 <<<
For some reason, I'm not taking as much pride in my work lately.

The image is fuzzy because the monitor has an acute design flaw.
>>>
 <<<
Acute?  That's an unusual choice of words.
>>>
 <<<
Would you have said 'acute' to a male co-worker?  I think not!
>>>
 <<<
It means crucial, that's all!
>>>
 <<<
I know what the word means! Do you think I don't see right through your sexist puns?
>>>
 <<<
No!  I swear, it was just a poor choice of words!!
>>>
 <<<
Well...okay, I accept your apology.  This time.
>>>
 <<<
So, what's wrong with the other monitor?
>>>
 <<<
Which?
>>>
1994-08-27 *

I am the king of my cubicle, the absolute ruler of this tiny realm.

I'm growing an army of genetic mutants to do my bidding.

Welcome to the Dogbert Outplacement Agency, or 'DOA' as I call it.
>>>
 <<<
Here, nobody is 'unemployed.'  You're freelance consultants who sit in cubicles and earn no money.
>>>
 <<<
Every cubicle is equipped with a phone and a refurbished ego.
>>>
 <<<
I will NOT work with that thing.
>>>
1994-08-18 * 
<<<
You're fired, Wally.  But since we care, we've contracted an outplacement agency to help you.
>>>
 <<<
You'll get your own cubicle.  And you can make all the photocopies you want!
>>>
 <<<
What would I want to photocopy?
>>>
 <<<
Food stamps, dollar bills, that sort of thing.

Great!  I've got two minutes to deliver my big report to our CEO.  Can you tell me where the fax is?

It will take a special kind of team to get by.

Go team!

Team!  Team!

Yes!

That's bad.

I don't understand something, Liz.  You told Dilbert you don't want to be physical until after marriage...
>>>
 <<<
I would expect him to be cranky around the house, yet he's quite relaxed...serene.  I don't see how...unless...
>>>
 <<<
Did you discover religion?

I think I'm Unitarian.

1994-08-08 * 
We've been dating for a while and I find you oddly appealing...

Laurie's our new engineer. Show her the ropes, Dilbert.

I meant figuratively.

This is your anti-productivity pod.

It's equipped with a little device that rings anytime you try to concentrate.
>>>
 <<<
The top is open so none of the background noise is inadvertently muffled.

And you're on the main aisle, so you'll be haunted every minute by footsteps behind you.  Step...step...step.

We need to talk.

Thanks for inviting me over, Dogbert.  We little hairless cats are usually shunned.

Our CEO cancelled his visit.  He's sending his top aid, Zimbue the Monkey, in his place.

Isn't that typical?  I spent a week exaggerating my accomplishments for this.  Now he sends a stupid monkey!

What could be more humiliating than trying to suck-up to a monkey?

1994-07-29 *

Have you summarized your accomplishments for our CEO?

Almost done.

Okay - My body converts toxic waste into penicillin, I'm clairvoyant, and I invented wool.

I thought sheep invented wool.

Our CEO will visit here next week.  You all know what to do.

1994-07-27 * 
<<<
From now on, twenty percent of your pay will depend on the company meeting its sales targets.
>>>
 <<<
In effect, we'll cut your pay and tell you it's your own darn fault.
>>>
 <<<
Will the sales target be based on a complex formula and involve numbers that can't be accurately measured?

You broke the code!

I have come to form a union to improve your working conditions!

 <<<
We can't join a union.  We're salaried.

I think it's against the law, or something.
>>>
 <<<
You've got long hours, no overtime, shrinking benefits and no job security.  You must act now!

You're confusing us with people who have spines.

Don't worry, I brought strap-on porta-spines for everybody.

Question one:  would you enjoy having your head rubbed vigorously on a piece of paper?

Who wouldn't?
>>>
1994-07-21 *

In market research terms, you belong to the 'techno geek' segment.

Made you look.

Suddenly, he leaps into action!  Years of training and experience come into focus!

The screen saver has been deactivated. But doubt sets in...was there a better way?

I should have moved the mouse.

1994-07-08 *

My philosophy is 'if life gives you lemons, make lemonade'.

Of course, the whole thing depends heavily on life also providing a big pitcher with ice and a few glasses.
>>>
 <<<
What?  No napkins?!
>>>
1994-07-07 * 
<<<
Dogbert told me about the birds and the bees.
>>>
 <<<
The bee part confuses me.  It seems like I'd get stung.

 <<<
And as for birds, I just wouldn't know the words to say.

 <<<
Try a humming bird.

1994-07-06 * 
Uh-oh...it's never good when we get mail from the benefits department.

Here's my daily project status report.

What are you drawing, Dogbert?

I'm creating a comic book called, 'The Adventures of Boron'.

'The most boring man in the entire Universe'.
>>>
 <<<
Boron looks like me.
>>>
 <<<
Geez, what an ego you have.
>>>
 <<<
In chapter one, Boron slays the entire marketing department by explaining asynchronous protocols.

I think it's high time we engineers got a little respect in this society!

 <<<
Furthermore, there are many advantages to asynchronous transfer mode switch technology!
>>>
 <<<
First, there's bandwidth...

This was our third date, Liz.  Tradition demands that you kiss me or give me the 'let's be friends' talk.

No, our first date only counted as 85 % because we were wearing our sweat pants.

I'm 15 % short?!!

It's too bad, because I really felt like kissing.

Dogbert the Publisher

Dear Tim, your book does not meet our current publishing needs.
>>>
 <<<
Your plot was lame and I hated your characters.  And by association I have come to hate you too.

For safety reasons, I hired an illiterate person to rip up your manuscript.  I would use the return envelope you provided but I'm afraid you might have licked the stamps.

I'd like to publish your book.  All it needs are a few minor changes.

Make the main character a purple dinosaur instead of a detective.  Add some upbeat songs and eliminate the murder.

It's a murder mystery!!
>>>
 <<<
Oh, that's original.
>>>
1994-06-28 * 
<<<
How's the book publishing business coming along?
>>>
 <<<
Great!
>>>
 <<<
I get to reject dozens of authors every day!  I call them untalented dolts and they THANK me for it.
>>>
 <<<
Eventually, you have to actually publish something.
>>>
 <<<
Yeah, well, that's the conventional wisdom.
>>>
1994-06-27 * 
<<<
I'm going to start my own book publishing company so I can reject people all day long.
>>>
 <<<
I'll dismiss their life's work with a gesture and a witty comment.

Bottom line, I'm just not a people person.

I've noticed.

We got the batteries, and the electric motor!

No; the human resources department, in case we have to do some emergency hiring.
>>>
 <<<
Is it upgradeable?
>>>
 <<<
Yeah, the Cuborg 3000 is expected to have air holes.
>>>
1994-06-18 * 
<<<
Liz, I noticed you're not wearing a ring.  Would you like to go for a pizza after the game?
>>>
 <<<
Oh, I do have a ring.  It's so big I can't wear it.  A team of eunuchs follows me around with it in a special van.
>>>
 <<<
Flop-sweat time.
>>>
 <<<
You're gullible.  I like that.
>>>
1994-06-17 * 
<<<
Bonk
>>>
 <<<
Gee, I've scored five goals that way.
>>>
 <<<
You've got a good head for this game.
>>>
1994-06-16 * 
<<<
Dilbert, you'll be playing the left striker position.
>>>
 <<<
One of our good players will try to strike you in the head with the ball and bank it in the goal.
>>>
 <<<
'It' being the ball, not your head.
>>>
 <<<
I'd better take off my glasses.
>>>
 <<<
No, don't.  I included their dampening effect in my calculations.
>>>
1994-06-15 * 
<<<
I joined the city soccer league.
>>>
 <<<
I've never played, but as an engineer I have a natural instinct for ball trajectory and passing angles.
>>>
 <<<
Where does the team play?
>>>
 <<<
Coach doesn't want to ruin my concentration by telling me.
>>>
1994-06-14 * 
<<<
The company cares deeply about the effects of long hours and stress on workers.
>>>
 <<<
So they're paying nearly $200 to have an expert on stress-reduction give a talk during lunch.
>>>
 <<<
Just when you think they don't care, something like this comes along.
>>>
 <<<
It's scheduled for lst Tuesday.
>>>
1994-06-13 * 
<<<
EMERGENCY ASSIGNMENT!!  URGENT! URGENT!
>>>
 <<<
It's only critical because everything sits on your desk until it either becomes moot or a crisis.
>>>
 <<<
From now on, I'm giving him the moots.
>>>
 <<<
Aging

1994-06-12 * 
<<<
My name is Ratbert. I fear the information superhighway.
>>>
 <<<
Like most of you, my problem started because I never learned to type.
>>>
 <<<
I thought only secretaries needed to type.
>>>
 <<<
Then the computers came.  At first I dismissed them as mere toys for men with no social skills.
>>>
 <<<
Soon they were everywhere.
>>>
 <<<
I would invent elaborate excuses to avoid computers.  I was caught in my own web of deception!
>>>
 <<<
This is 'Alcoholics Anonymous'.
>>>
 <<<
I didn't interrupt you.
>>>
 <<<
Can we talk about me now?
>>>
1994-06-11 * 
<<<
I wish I were smart like you.  Then I'd get some respect.
>>>
 <<<
We're all smart in different ways.  Your special gift may be creativity, a talent, or even the ability to love.
>>>
 <<<
I can burp wth my cheeks full...urp!
>>>
 <<<
I'd go with that if I were you.
>>>
1994-06-10 * 
<<<
I've never seen you do any real work around here, Irv.  How do you get away with it?
>>>
 <<<
I wrote the code for our accounting system back in the mid-eighties.  It's a million lines of undocumented spaghetti logic.
>>>
 <<<
It's the Holy Grail of technology!!
>>>
 <<<
You boys may find a little extra in your envelopes this month.
>>>
1994-06-09 * 
<<<
If I start the project today and work nights and weekends it will take...oh, six months.
>>>
 <<<
It has to be done in ONE month so we can show it to our VP on her annual visit.
>>>
 <<<
I have to know; does it even cross your mind to handle this differently?
>>>
 <<<
I'll need daily status reports on why you're so behind.
>>>
1994-06-08 * 
<<<
I saw the code for your computer program yesterday.
>>>
 <<<
It looked easy.  It's just a bunch of typing.  And half the words were spelled wrong.
>>>
 <<<
And don't get me started about your over-use of colons.
>>>
 <<<
They remind me of you, sir.
>>>
1994-06-07 * 
<<<
This desktop video conference thing is great!
>>>
 <<<
Even though you're telecommuting, you still maintain a level of professionalism.
>>>
 <<<
Let's share a document next time.
>>>
1994-06-06 * 
<<<
Is Bob in his office?
>>>
 <<<
Since Bob's office is all of twenty feet away, I'll have to use my psychic powers to determine the answer.
>>>
 <<<
I could go look.
>>>
 <<<
Bob hates you.  He secretly wishes you'd choke on a donut.
>>>
1994-06-05 * 
<<<
From now on, any engineer can shut down our factory for any reason.
>>>
 <<<
Later we'll film a commercial about how ethical and empowered you are.
>>>
 <<<
Ha!  Give me a raise, Tubby, or the factory's going down!
>>>
 <<<
You can't shut it down, I'm shutting it down until more women are in top management.
>>>
 <<<
I'd like to shut it down for a day, just as an ego booster.  Is Tuesday good?
>>>
 <<<
Didn't any of you hear that there's an endangered bird living in the parking lot??
>>>
 <<<
I think I parked on it this morning.
>>>
 <<<
Can we get back to the point?
>>>
1994-06-04 * 
<<<
You've got inflation eating you from the bottom...and no real opportunity for a promotion.
>>>
 <<<
And as long as all the other companies are downsizing too, you have no leverage.  I can get away with anything!
>>>
 <<<
I miss the eighties.
>>>
 <<<
Does this hurt?
>>>
1994-06-03 * 
<<<
In this sensitivity excercise, close your eyes and imagine how it feels to be a woman.
>>>
 <<<
People acknowledge my existence.  They smile for no reason and hold hte door open.  I'm ...I'm popular.
>>>
 <<<
I can't find my keys.
>>>
 <<<
I'm never going back.  I can't.  I won't.
>>>
 <<<
My blouse falls to the floor...
>>>
 <<<
Break!  Break!
>>>
1994-06-02 * 
In 'diversity sensitivity' training you will learn to respect those who are different.
>>>
1994-06-01 * 
<<<
I can't believe we have to go to 'diversity sensitivity' training.
>>>
 <<<
Wally, I don't see how it could be bad to seek a better understanding of others.
>>>
 <<<
Uh-oh.
>>>
 <<<
Take a seat in the 'dumpy white guy section'.  I'm ready to start.
>>>
1994-05-31 * 
<<<
Dilbert, I'm sending you to 'diversity sensitivity' training.
>>>
 <<<
Alice doesn't have to go because chicks are born already knowing this stuff.  It's as natural as shopping and crying.
>>>
 <<<
Can I get a 'Midol' for either one of you?
>>>
 <<<
Whump whump whump
>>>
1994-05-30 * 
I recently received this angry letter from a mister 'Dork'.
>>>
1994-05-29 * 
<<<
Wally, I'm promoting you to Director of the Engineering Quality Group!
>>>
 <<<
Yes!
>>>
 <<<
Wait a minute.  I thought you were going to eliminate that group.
>>>
 <<<
Your assignment is to fire them all.
>>>
 <<<
Aaagh!  That will be hideous!
>>>
 <<<
And when I'm done you won't need a director.  Then you'll fire me!
>>>
 <<<
You have my word that I will not fire you.
>>>
 <<<
Hi, guys.
>>>
 <<<
That would be a job for Executive Director Dilbert.
>>>
1994-05-28 * 
<<<
From now on, I prefer that you not refer to my genus by the derogatory word 'rat'.
>>>
 <<<
The correct word is 'rattus'.  It is the right of any group to define its own name.  You must respect that.
>>>
 <<<
Don't call me a dog anymore.  From now on my correct name is 'smarter-than-a-stupid-rattus'.
>>>
1994-05-27 * 
<<<
From now on, Bob please refer to me as a 'rattus', not by the diminutive term 'rat'.
>>>
 <<<
Frankly, I've never thought of folks like you in terms of your genus.  I see you as part of a larger community.
>>>
 <<<
Really?
>>>
 <<<
Yeah - the community of things that go 'sqeak' when I step on them.
>>>
 <<<
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.
>>>
1994-05-26 * 
<<<
Why is that thing called a mouse and not a rat?
>>>
 <<<
At the risk of being labelled, quote, politically correct, unquote, I must object.
>>>
 <<<
I demand to have something named in my honor!
>>>
 <<<
What about the 'scuzzy' interface?  Hee hee.
>>>
1994-05-25 * 
<<<
I'm cancelling your project so I can give your funding to a project that has a much cooler acronym.
>>>
 <<<
Ha!  The joke's on you!  I anticipated this move from the beginning and have done nothing but carry empty binders for weeks!
>>>
 <<<
Being good at your job is less fulfilling than you might think, Dogbert.
>>>
1994-05-24 * 
<<<
I was just reading your project status report.
>>>
 <<<
You say the project is delayed 'due to the ongoing bungling of a clueless, pointy-haired individual.'
>>>
 <<<
Instead of saying 'due to', it would read better as 'facilitated by'.
>>>
1994-05-23 * 
Did you remember what the steering committee decided about my project?
>>>
1994-05-22 * 
<<<
Let's spend the next four hours reviewing the project plan.
>>>
 <<<
I've detailed every resource, task and dependency into an exquisitely accurate road map.
>>>
 <<<
It took me two weeks, but it's the only way to make sure we're not wasting time.
>>>
 <<<
My tasks are two weeks late because I was waiting for your input.
>>>
 <<<
And you left off one task, so all the dependencies are wrong.
>>>
 <<<
I'm changing all of my estimate to 'to be determined'.
>>>
 <<<
Can we do that?  I've just been using random numbers.
>>>
 <<<
I'll have to redo the whole plan.
>>>
 <<<
Don't worry.  We won't do anything until we hear from you.
>>>
1994-05-21 * 
<<<
We just had a meeting and decided to change your project substantially.
>>>
 <<<
We didn't invite you to the meeting because things go smoother when nobody has any actual knowledge.
>>>
 <<<
So, what are the changes?
>>>
 <<<
If I remember, I'll leave you a voice mail.
>>>
1994-05-20 * 
How's your project coming along?
>>>
1994-05-19 * 
Your department has a reputation for being difficult to work with.  But I know we can cooperate to make my project a success.
>>>
1994-05-18 * 
Wally would you like to be on my 'TTP' project?
>>>
1994-05-17 * 
<<<
Thank you all for coming to the project kick-off meeting.
>>>
 <<<
As project manager I've decided not to tell you the purpose of the project.  That way it will be harder for you to sabotage it.
>>>
 <<<
Does it require ny super-fast microchips?
>>>
 <<<
Good lord, no.  Don't build any of those...by Tuesday.
>>>
1994-05-16 * 
I'm putting you in charge of an important project which is fully funded.
>>>
1994-05-15 * 
<<<
Hi guys, how are your families?
>>>
 <<<
?
>>> <<<
?
>>>
 <<<
Why are you pretending to be interested in our personal lives?
>>>
 <<<
It's a management technique to increase your job satisfaction without giving you more money.
>>>
 <<<
My plan is to boost your intangible benefits while continuing to chisel away at your salaries.
>>>
 <<<
But enough about me...how are those families of yours?
>>>
 <<<
My wife divorced me because you make me work so many hours.
>>>
 <<<
This job lowers my self-esteem too much to attract a mate.
>>>
 <<<
Tell them I said 'hi'.
>>>
1994-05-14 * 
Here's my final consulting report on your company.
>>>
1994-05-13 * 
<<<
When I hired the 'Dogbert Consulting Company' he said his consultants were so smart they had to wrap their brains around their torsos.
>>>
 <<<
But that looks like a slab of liver.
>>>
 <<<
This slab of liver has an MBA from Harvard, you pointy-haired fool!!
>>>
 <<<
Wow, you guys are good debaters.
>>>
1994-05-12 * 
<<<
Ratbert the consultant
>>>
 <<<
It looks like you've all done your assignments for me.
>>>
 <<<
Your input is so important that I'll have it put in a big binder in stored in the same building that your president works!
>>>
 <<<
And I'll put in a good word for you when I meet with your boss later today.
>>>
 <<<
Wink, thumbs up
>>>
 <<<
How about two good words?
>>>
1994-05-11 * 
<<<
I'm the project leader for the Dogbert Consulting Company.  You simple employees shall do my bidding.
>>>
 <<<
I'll be sending you on an endless variety of data-gathering expeditions.  That will keep you busy while I do the thinking.
>>>
 <<<
By the way, this may look like a slab of liver but it's an external brain pack.
>>>
 <<<
My career just reached an all time low.
>>>
1994-05-10 * 
Ratbert the Consultant 
1994-05-09 * 
The Dogbert Consulting Company will plot a new course for your business.

I don't understand any of our projects, so I cut the ones with 'e' in their names.

What was that letter?
>>>
 <<<
Eeee!
>>>
 <<<
Engineers
>>>
 <<<
We doubled our cost, to add backup systems.
>>>
 <<<
You can't be too careful.

Two at once, in case one enjoys it!

Mmm.

Market segmentation is the key.

Don't improve the product, just find dumber customers!

These guys sure know how to delegate!

You're the new VP of wedgies.

1994-05-07 * 
I'm going to seek relief from my many woes by sharing them with you.
>>>
1994-05-06 * 
<<<
My user representative is the stupidest...
>>>
 <<<
No way!  My user is the stupidest.
>>>
 <<<
Oh yeah?!  Let's have a little wager.  Go get your user and I'll get mine!
>>>
 <<<
You're on!
>>>
 <<<
Have another scone, Tom.
>>>
 <<<
You're right.  They do look just like styrofoam cups.
>>>
 <<<
It's a new paradigm...
>>>
1994-05-05 * 
<<<
We don't know what the project should do or who would use it.
>>>
 <<<
But if you could tell us what it costs to build it, we'll figure out the rest later.
>>>
 <<<
What year do you plan to sell it?
>>>
 <<<
What am I - psychic or something??
>>>
1994-05-04 * 
The staff meeting at Dilbert's house ends 
1994-05-03 * 
<<<
How foolish of you to host the all-day staff meeting at your house.
>>>
 <<<
Let's form sub-teams to be more efficient.  Ted will do accidental spills. Alice, you critique the decor.  I'll be a floater.
>>>
 <<<
Kichen, shoddily done...
>>>
 <<<
I spilled mayonaise on the wall.
>>>
 <<<
Where's the bathroom?
>>>
1994-05-02 * 
We could have our next all-day staff meeting at my house.
>>>
1994-05-01 * 
Thank you all for coming to our engineering quality team meeting.
>>>
1994-04-30 * 
<<<
If we know our senior executive is making a bad decision, shouldn't we tell her?
>>>
 <<<
Hmm, yes.  Let's end our careers by challenging a decision that won't change.  That's a great idea.
>>>
 <<<
I'm getting mixed signals here.
>>>
 <<<
And let's pull our neckties until it hurts!
>>> 1994-04-29 * 
Thp-p-p-p-p.
>>>
1994-04-28 * 
Take care of this immediately.  It's your top priority.
>>>
1994-04-27 * 
<<<
I want you to help me upgrade the computer in my office.
>>>
 <<<
The computer in your office is a cardboard prop that came with your desk.
>>>
 <<<
So, I need a new motherboard, right?
>>>
 <<<
No, you need a new desk.
>>>
1994-04-26 * 
<<<
This year, instead of raises we're giving appliances.
>>>
 <<<
What?!
>>>
 <<<
High performers could get a color television or a new 'fridge.
>>>
 <<<
He called it a 'lava lamp'.
>>>
 <<<
I call it a jar of old mayonnaise.

I don't mind using my prehistoric mouse-driven computer.

From now on you'll be working full time on our takeover of DSN.
>>>
 <<<
You must also identify any unnecessary jobs that can be cut after the takeover.
>>>
 <<<
That would be the people who worked on the take-over.
>>>
 <<<
Ooh, I broadcasted that move.
>>>
1994-04-21 * 
We'll give you sixty billion for the 'Dogbert Static Network'.  Half of that will be stock in our company.
>>>
1994-04-20 * 
<<<
Bad news sir - our arch rivals are out-bidding us for control of DSN.
>>>
 <<<
Apparently they have even less creative investment ideas than we do.
>>>
 <<<
Quick!  Give more money to our consultants!
>>>
 <<<
They're spending as fast as they can, Sir!!
>>>
1994-04-19 * 
You can't copyright the static on blank TV channels! <<<
I already did.
>>> <<<
You can't let my company pay fifty billion dollars to buy your so-called film library.
>>> <<<
I already am.
>>> <<<
I may have to blow the whistle on this deal.
>>> <<<
It'll have to be a nose whistle - I copyrighted everything else.

Here's the press release about our bid to buy 'DSN' for fifty billion dollars.

DSN is the hollywood studio that provides static to all the channels that woudl otherwise be blank.

The 'Dogbert Static Network'?!!

Talk to me, babe.

1994-04-17 *

As your leader it's my job to provide a vision.
>>>
 <<<
But frankly, I'm not seeing anything.
>>>
 <<<
Have another donut.  Sometimes the sugar helps.
>>>
 <<<
It's working.  I'm getting something, but it's fuzzy.
>>>
 <<<
Quick!  Try my coffee!
>>>

Mmph!
>>>
 <<<
Oh yeah, there it is. Oh-oh-oh.
>>>
 <<<
It looks like I'll be living in a big house with servants.  And you'll all get laid off.
>>>
 <<<
This vision thing is overrated.
>>>
 <<<
So; do you have a gardener lined up yet?
>>>
1994-04-16 * 
<<<
I've never minded putting makeup on, but it's a real bother to take it off.
>>>
 <<<
That seems like a lot of work, I must admit.
>>>  <<<
But I still think it's better to remove the old stuff.
>>>
 <<<
It's only a problem at the bowling alley.
>>>
1994-04-15 * 
<<<
You've got to delay the beta trial with customers until we figure out why it keeps exploding!
>>>
 <<<
You engineers are such pessimists.  Just once, try to focus on the positive aspects of the trial!
>>>
 <<<
We won't need to hassle with 'non-disclosure agreements'.
>>>
1994-04-14 * 
I agreed to ship Project 'Dewdrop' to some customers for beta testing.
>>>
1994-04-13 * 
Tell me about your project and I'll translate it into weasel words for the business case.
>>>
1994-04-12 * 
I hired a weasel to help us write our business case.
>>>
1994-04-11 * 
<<<
Our device conforms to all international standards for communications.
>>>
 <<<
In other words, it doesn't do anything useful and it's not your fault.
>>>
 <<<
Is there somebody less experienced I could talk to?
>>>
 <<<
Do you have my boss's number?
>>>
1994-04-10 * 
<<<
What's your position on gun ownership, Dogbert?
>>>
 <<<
I believe everybody should have the right to own guns.
>>>
 <<<
What about automatic weapons?
>>>
 <<<
I'm all for them.
>>>
 <<<
Citizens should have bazookas and rocket launchers, too.
>>>
 <<<
I believe that all citizens should have the weapons of their choice.
>>>
 <<<
However, I also believe that only I should have ammunition.
>>>
 <<<
Because frankly, I wouldn't trust the rest of you Goobers with anything more dangerous than string.
>>>
 <<<
What about Charleton Heston?
>>>
 <<<
I'd keep the string away from him.

Value priced lottery tickets

This is dated yesterday.
>>>

Ooh, bad luck.  Try again?
>>>
1994-04-08 * 
<<<
What makes these a 'value'?
>>>

Value priced lottery tickets
>>>
 <<<
They're half the normal price, and yet the chance of winning is only one in ten million less.
>>>
 <<<
Hey!  This is for yesterday's lottery!
>>>
 <<<
And your point is...?

1994-04-07 *

Dilbert gets political

I'd love to have you and...what's-her-face come to my little dinner party.

I like to do a little gourmet cooking...when I'm not raising money to battle unpopular diseases.
>>>
 <<<
Is it just me, or are the other guests crash dummies.
>>>
 <<<
It's just you.
>>>
1994-04-06 * 
<<<
If you want to get promoted, say bad things about your co-workers so you look better by comparison.
>>>
 <<<
Geez, Lisa, it looks like you been hitting the donuts pretty hard lately.
>>>
 <<<
Heh-heh...big things are coming my way soon.
>>>
1994-04-05 * 
I want you to teach me everything you know about corporate politics so I can get promoted to your level.
>>>
1994-04-04 * 
<<<
The only way to get ahead in this company is by getting promoted to management.
>>>
 <<<
I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get promoted.  I want to follow in your footsteps.
>>>
 <<<
But I'm wondering if a lobotomy is actually necessary.
>>>
 <<<
No, we'll just run you through 'quality training'.
>>>
1994-04-03 * 
Your performance this year was 'fair'.
>>>
1994-04-02 * 
<<<
Would you like some chicken, Bob?
>>>
 <<<
I told you I'm a vegetarian.  I eat vegetables.
>>>
 <<<
How about fish?  Do you eat fish?
>>>
 <<<
Fish are not vegetables.
>>>
 <<<
How about clams?  Do you eat clams?
>>>
 <<<
No, but you're starting to look good.

Evolution favors monkeys.  Eventually, humans will be kept in cages as pets.

Bah!
>>>
 <<<
Impossible!  We humans will never allow ourselves to be treated like that!
>>>
 <<<
Now get out of my cubicle!
>>>
1994-03-31 * 
<<<
Your big mistake, evolution-wise, was inventing computers that are easier to use if you have a tail.
>>>
 <<<
It's an ironic twist in the Darwinian saga.  You've guaranteed the extinction of your own species.
>>>
 <<<
Stop working while I'm talking to you, Zimbu!!
>>>
 <<<
I can hear the evolutionary clock...tick-tick-tick-tick.
>>>
1994-03-30 * 
<<<
Zimbue, you're not supposed to use your tail to operate the mouse.
>>>
 <<<
If tails were a natural advantage for engineers then evolution would provide us ALL with tails!
>>>
 <<<
Dilbert, I don't believe you've met Rocky, our new C programmer.
>>>
1994-03-29 * 
<<<
Well, well, it looks like Zimbu has designed another commercially viable product using only his tail.
>>>
 <<<
I could have done that...if I hadn't erased my hard drive when I installed my security software.
>>>
 <<<
I don't produce much, but it's VERY secure.
>>>
 <<<
Here's another one.

1994-03-28 * 
Zimbu the monkey designed three commercial products this week!  We'd better find out his secret.

>>>
 <<<
I try to prove I'm competent by speeding through the menus.
>>>
 <<<
Good lord, I hit the Mandarin Chinese language option.
>>>
 <<<
Oh, no!  I think I transferred my life's savings to the 'United Way'.
>>>
 <<<
Great...now his eyeballs are stuck to the back of my neck.
>>>
 <<<
This is exactly why I hate going to the automated teller.
>>>
 <<<
I think a little 'visine' would make him slide right off.
>>>
 <<<
There was a time I could afford that...
>>>
1994-03-26 * 
<<<
The end of the world is coming in year 2000.  Therefore, you should give me your money before it's too late.
>>>
 <<<
It is written that money is evil.  I'll keep your money in Dogbert's special 'evil-be-gone' device.
>>>
 <<<
And it's completely deductible...from your savings.
>>>
 <<<
So I'm actually making money!
>>>
1994-03-25 * 
<<<
I'm predicting the world will end in the year 2000.
>>>
 <<<
The creator of the universe works in mysterious ways.  But he uses a base ten counting system and likes round numbers.
>>>
 <<<
So you really want to avoid being, let's say, in mobile home number 1,000,000 in the year 2000.
>>>
 <<<
I'm feeling anxiety.
>>>
1994-03-24 * 
I've become a doomsday prophet so I can scare gullible people.
>>>
1994-03-23 * 
<<<
Lisa, I was wondering if you'd like to go out to dinner Saturday night.
>>>
 <<<
Uh...I have to wash my hair Saturday.  How about having coffee here at work instead?
>>>
 <<<
I'll pass.  I was hoping for someone with clean hair.
>>>
1994-03-22 * 
Lunch?  With you?  I'd love to but...uh...
>>>
1994-03-21 * 
<<<
Hi, Cheryl.  Would you like to have lunch with me next week?
>>>
 <<<
I...uh...already ate lunch.  I'm not hungry.
>>>
 <<<
I'm talking about NEXT WEEK!!
>>>
 <<<
I don't think I could have another bite.  All full.
>>>
1994-03-20 * 

1994-03-19 * 
<<<
Susan, I'm reorganizing the department again.  The budget you worked on for months is now worthless.
>>>
 <<<
I think when you have bad news you should make an effort to break it gradually, maybe build up to it.
>>>
 <<<
Oh, that reminds me: you're fired.
>>>
1994-03-18 * 
Sometimes I think these constant reorganizations are just excuses for getting rid of unwanted employees.
>>>
1994-03-17 * 
<<<
These constant reorganizations do not take into consideration the needs of the employees.
>>>
 <<<
I've decided to use you for spare parts.  Your liver will be sent to Jose in accounting, immediately.
>>>
 <<<
Jose has a bad liver?
>>>
 <<<
No, but why take a chance?
>>>
1994-03-16 * 
We'll need a name for the newly reorganized department.
>>>
1994-03-15 * 
I'm creating a new layer of management so I don't have to talk to you in person anymore.
>>>
1994-03-14 * 
All of our projects are floundering.  I decided on a bold new strategy.
>>>
1994-03-13 *

Dogbert's Body Language Update
>>>
 <<<
Are you hampered by the limits of conventional body language?
>>>
 <<<
I can help.
>>>
 <<<
How can you politely tell somebody he's babbling?
>>>
 <<<
Babble, Babble.
>>>
 <<<
Remove the offender's watch while he babbles.
>>>
 <<<
Babble.
>>>
 <<<
Smash the watch with your daily planner.
>>>
 <<<
Babble.
>>>
 <<<
Whack!
>>>
 <<<
This won't stop the babble, but it will feel real good for a minute.
>>>
 <<<
Babble.
>>>
 <<<
Mmm.
>>>
 <<<
Use this position to signal your surrender to the babble.
>>>
 <<<
Babble.
>>>
 <<<
Next week - the self-Heimlich manuever and the Kervorkian dodge.
>>>
 <<<
Babble.

1994-03-12 * 
<<<
At the current rate of inflation, with no raises or promotions...
>>>
 <<<
Our net worth at retirement will be...a shopping cart full of aluminum cans.
>>>
 <<<
We'd better do something.
>>>
 <<<
I'm going shopping before all the good carts are gone.
>>>
1994-03-11 * 
<<<
I'm telling you - if nobody gets a raise, half the engineers will quit!
>>>
 <<<
That's the goal.  We're trying to reduce headcount by fifty percent.
>>>
 <<<
But all the smart people will leave!
>>>
 <<<
Would you mind organizing a goodbye potluck lunch for them?
>>>
1994-03-10 * 
<<<
The company has announced there will be no raises or promotions this year.
>>>
 <<<
Now, there's a mathematical certainty that no matter how hard you work, inflation will make you poorer.
>>>
 <<<
I hated the old way, with all the uncertainty.
>>>
 <<<
I'm not just a manager, I'm a leader!
>>>
1994-03-09 * 
<<<
I can assure you that the value of the average employee will continue to increase.
>>>
 <<<
Is that because there will be less of us, doing more work?
>>>
 <<<
I'm right, aren't I?
>>>
 <<<
Except for the 'us' part.
>>>
1994-03-08 * 
<<<
Susan, I want you to make some budget cuts throughout my department.
>>>
 <<<
But I'm only the budget analyst.
>>>
 <<<
I couldn't possibly understand all the engineering projects enough to make intelligent choices.
>>>
 <<<
Really?  Great!  I thought it was just me!
>>>
 <<<
Shall I whomp up as strategy while I'm at it?
>>>
1994-03-07 * 
<<<
We in engineering think of the marketing department as our customer, Fred.
>>>
 <<<
That's great.  I'd like you to do a technical feasibility study for me.
>>>
 <<<
Would that require any work?
>>>
 <<<
I said 'customer', not 'boss'.

1994-03-06 *

How to reorganize for success
>>>
 <<<
Put all your deadbeats and whiners in one subgroup.
>>>
 <<<
We don't want to be a subgroup.
>>>
 <<<
Give them a project that duplicates work being done by more competent people elsewhere in the company.
>>>
 <<<
Soon the manager of the competent people will find out you're duplicating his work.
>>>
 <<<
You're on my turf.
>>>
 <<<
Boo hoo.
>>>
 <<<
He'll make a play to get your project under his control.
>>>
 <<<
Big Boss
>>>
 <<<
They should be transferred to my control.
>>>
 <<<
Before you transfer the deadbeats, give them high performance reviews to conceal your treachery.
>>>
 <<<
Godlike?  Wow!
>>>
 <<<
I'll miss you.
>>>
 <<<
In time, the manager who took your losers will fail, thus decreasing competition for promotions.
>>>
 <<<
Aaiii!!
>>>
 <<<
Next week I'll discuss teamwork - the manager's obstacle to success.
>>>
1994-03-05 * 
<<<
According to this, a technical degree becomes obsolete in five years.
>>>
 <<<
Do you mind?  I'm trying to get some work done on the...uh...
>>>
 <<<
Uh-oh.
>>>
 <<<
Doohickey.
>>>
1994-03-04 * 
<<<
Do you remember last election day...and how you convinced me to not vote?
>>>
 <<<
You argued that since we disagreed on all issues, we could both stay home and the outcome would be the same as if we both voted.
>>>
 <<<
Dogs can't vote!
>>>
 <<<
Well, not directly.
>>>
1994-03-03 * 
Here's our preliminary recommendation for radically reengineering our business processes.
>>>
1994-03-02 * 
<<<
You should hire me as your process reengineering consultant.
>>>
 <<<
I would be totally objective about what jobs to eliminate.  Frankly, I don't care about anybody at your company!
>>>
 <<<
You've got the right attitude.
>>>
 <<<
I think I'll wear a flowing robe and surround myself with cherubs.
>>>
1994-03-01 * 
Reengineering is simple.  You start by questioning the employees who would get fired if you succeed.
>>>
1994-02-28 * 
I just read this great book about how to 'reengineer' our business processes.
>>>
1994-02-27 * 
<<<
Here's your employee locator device.
>>>
 <<<
Sensors in the building will be able to track you at all times.
>>>
 <<<
We'll know how many times you use the restroom and how long.
>>>
 <<<
It's a dog collar...the final humiliation.
>>>
 <<<
Once you got used to working in cubicles like gerbils, we knew anything was possible.
>>>
 <<<
My conformance rationalization mechanisms are kicking in.
>>>
 <<<
It's not so bad.  A collar is simply an efficient design.  Everyone is doing it.
>>>
 <<<
It's not so bad.
>>>
 <<<
It's powered by this six foot long extension cord.
>>>
1994-02-26 * 
<<<
According to you, if I cut your budget the world will abruptly stop spinning and we'll be flung into space.
>>>
 <<<
Whereas, the risk of cutting Dilbert's project is '...a plage of locusts o'er the land.'
>>>
 <<<
I'll cut both projects.  With any luck, we'll fling the locusts into space.
>>>
 <<<
Locusts.  Real good.
>>>
1994-02-25 * 
You've completely eliminated the budget for technical training!
>>>
1994-02-24 * 
<<<
Shhh.
>>>
 <<<
We were just talking about you, sir...in glowing terms.
>>>
 <<<
He's a flaming idiot.
>>>
 <<<
One stick of dynamite - it's al I ask.
>>>
1994-02-23 * 
We've reached a new low in the 'potluck lunch' sign-up.
>>>
1994-02-22 * 
<<<
Here's your 'buzzword bingo' card for the meeting.
>>>
 <<<
If the boss uses a buzzword on your card, you check it off.  The objective is to fill a row.
>>>
 <<<
You're all very attentive today.  My proactive leadership must be working!
>>>
 <<<
Bingo, sir.
>>>
1994-02-21 * 
The layoffs will be handled in the most human way possible.
>>>
1994-02-20 * 
<<<
How great products are designed.
>>>
 <<<
Go talk to marketing.
>>>
 <<<
Groan.
>>>
 <<<
Dave, tell me what marketing wants the new product to do.
>>>
 <<<
It has to have a 45 inch screen and still fit in a purse or wallet.
>>>
 <<<
It needs to act as a communication satellite as well as an air freshener.
>>>
 <<<
Uh.
>>>
 <<<
It must cure deadly diseases and whiten your teeth while you sleep!
>>>
 <<<
Ha ha!!  And it has to be capable of time travel!  and have a telepathic user interface!
>>>
 <<<
*SLAP!*
>>>
 <<<
I could write a program that makes fish appear on the computer screen.
>>>
 <<<
Yeah...a lot of people want that.
>>>
1994-02-19 * 
<<<
35 inch monitor, 20 MEGs of RAM, 1.2 gigabytes of hard disk space...
>>>
 <<<
I feel a song coming on.
>>>
 <<<
People...who don't need people...are the ha-a-a-ppiest people.
>>>
1994-02-18 * 
<<<
Although I'm technically the 'Boss' I believe it's my job to make resources available to you, the common employees.
>>>
 <<<
I need more money for my project.
>>>
 <<<
Sorry, all gone.
>>>
 <<<
Maybe I'll get on your calendar so we can discuss it.
>>>
 I've got twenty minutes next summer.
>>>
1994-02-17 * 
<<<
I say it's easier to ask forgiveness than to ask permission.
>>>
 <<<
I say it's better to seek permission, thus delaying your personal risk until it all becomes moot in the next reorganization.
>>>
 <<<
That makes mine sound kinda stupid.
>>>
 <<<
Get over it.
>>>
1994-02-16 * 
As the leader of this organization it's my job to set priorities.
>>>
1994-02-15 * 
<<<
I can't live my life trying to please others.
>>>
 <<<
I think I can speak for all others when I say, 'Fool! You'd better please us or we'll crush you!'
>>>
 <<<
It was just a thought.
>>>
 <<<
We 'others' don't like to be threatened.
>>>
1994-02-14 * 
What shall we tell the guy from marketing this time?
>>>
1994-02-13 * 
<<<
That joke was not funny.  You're insensitive, Dogbert.
>>>
 <<<
Well, here we go with the 'insensitive dog bashing'.
>>>
 <<<
Is it my fault I was born without the ability to sense the feelings of others?
>>>
 <<<
Oh, sure, I wish I could be like you.
>>>
 <<<
Somehow you know exactly what it feels like to a different gender, race, lifestyle or body.
>>>
 <<<
But I'm insensitive. All I know is how I feel!!  And I'm proud of it!
>>>
 <<<
But you'd understand that, if you weren't insensitive about insensitivity!!
>>>
 <<<
When you put it like that, I feel kinda bad.
>>>
 <<<
Who cares?
>>>
1994-02-12 * 
I found a way to profit from my innate cuteness.
>>>
1994-02-11 * 
<<<
Have you ever noticed how incredibly cute I am?
>>>
 <<<
Look at this little black nose, soft furry ears, adorable little tail...with these looks I could get away with murder.
>>>
 <<<
I'm thinking of becoming a hit man for the mob.
>>>
 <<<
I'm glad we have these little talks.
>>>
1994-02-10 * 
<<<
We must constantly ask ourselves what we can do to delight our customers.
>>>
 <<<
We could stop having these meetings, fire everybody in the room and lower the prices of our products.
>>>
 <<<
I was thinking more alone the lines of a slogan.
>>>
 <<<
How about, 'we waste your money'?
>>>
1994-02-09 * 
<<<
I realize that casual dress day isn't easy for you engineers...
>>>
 <<<
But you've exceeded the bonds of good taste.  i've got to send you home to change.
>>>
 <<<
shut up, Wally.
>>>
 <<<
I heard they were back!  I swear!
>>>
1994-02-08 * 
The new dress code allows casual clothing on fridays.
>>>
1994-02-07 * 
<<<
I thought it necessary to provide detailed guidelines to our new casual dress code.
>>>
 <<<
Forbidden clothing includes:  shorts, tank tops, tee shirts, shirts with slogans, blue jeans, sneakers and sandals.
>>>
 <<<
My morale is soaring.
>>>
 <<<
Appendix 'A' is the approved underwear list.
>>>
1994-02-06 * 
<<<
I tried to fax it but our fax machine is broken.
>>>
 <<<
I would send it by modem but my communication software is incompatible with my new system software upgrade.
>>>
 <<<
No...our electronic mail systems are incompatible.
>>>
 <<<
Mail it?
>>>
 <<<
I've only got one copy and our copier is out of toner.
>>>
 <<<
Well, normally I could print another one but our LAN is being rewired.
>>>
 <<<
I could just read it to you.
>>>
 <<<
I describe how technology improves our lives by...yeah, I'll hold.
>>>
 <<<
Hello?
>>>
 <<<
Dang.
>>>
1994-02-05 * 
<<<
I've got my 3-D stereo for life-like sound...

 <<<
I've got hgh definition television for life-like video...
>>>
 <<<
Do you have a life yet?
>>>
 <<<
No, but I'm darn close.

1994-02-04 *

No, 'C' is a computer language, not the grade for my project.

What's happening?

He turned into a black hole, so dense that light cannot escape his field of gravity.

Unfortunately, only his ideas can escape the gravity because they lack substance.

What if you program in 'B'?
>>>
1994-02-03 *

Is your job plagued by the evil demons of stupidity?
>>>
 <<<
Simply affix this image of Saint Dogbert to every document, cubicle or computer you want to protect and watch your career being to change!
>>>
 <<<
Out Out!!  You demons of stupidity!!
>>>
1994-02-02 * 
Hold still while I exorcise the demons of stupidity that possess you.
>>>
1994-02-01 * 
<<<
Saint Dogbert seeks out technology that has been possessed by the demons of stupidity.
>>>
 <<<
He happens across a software developer.
>>>
 <<<
I'll make the command easy to remember, like 'ctrl-alt-F4-Del'.
>>>
 <<<
And if they forget that they can just edit the source code in 'command.com'.  Perfect!
>>>
 <<<
Out! Out!
>>>
1994-01-31 * 
I declare myself the patron saint of technology.

I've joined the spotted chipmunk preservation society.

 <<<
We're going to tranquilize the last known male and unite it with a female.
>>>

There he is!
>>>
 <<<
Thunk!
>>>
 <<<
When you think about it: that's an awfully large dart to use on a chipmunk.
>>>
 <<<
It's Dilbert's turn to write the newsletter.
>>>
 <<<
Trust me.  Humor is the way to go.  It eases tension.
>>>
 <<<
Yeah, but a while issue of dead chipmunk jokes?
>>>
1994-01-29 * 
<<<
The less you know, the happier you are.

While you struggle with that computer, I'm naked, clueless and f-e-e-e-ling good!

You're really annoying me now.

Totally naked!  Isn't that a hoot?

...The French stopped bombing Elbonia when they realized there was nothing worth destroying.

Ironically, the GNP of Elbonia tripled by selling the bomb fragments for scrap.  When I left they were trying to goad France into another war.

You call this swill champagne??  If we drank this we'd have to eat snails to get the taste out of our mouths too!!

The French are bombin us!!  Run!!

Project status:  We accidentally destroyed the French satellite and are now at war with France.

Maybe you should be a little more upbeat in your report.  Emphasize the positive.

1994-01-25 * 
The corporate office sent me to head up the Elbonian satellite launching program.

Our Elbonian division was the low bidder for launching French satellites into orbit.

I dropped mine in the...John.

Again??  Why don't you reach in and fish it out?
>>>
 <<<
I tried, but then my pager fell in too.
>>>
 <<<
Reach in and get them both.
>>>
 <<<
I tried, of course, but when my vast array of writing tools fell in they kind of wedged...
>>>
 <<<
Try it again!!!
>>>
 <<<
Where are your glasses?
>>>
 <<<
Shut up.
>>>
1994-01-22 * 
<<<
You're unsuccessful in love because you keep forgetting opposites attract.
>>>
 <<<
Logically, the woman who would be most attracted to you are beautiful and intellectually stimulating.
>>>
 <<<
You're right.  I've been underestimating my drawing power.
>>>
 <<<
And women love it when you pose like this for them.
>>>
1994-01-21 * 
The pheremone cologne is making women desire me physically but they can't reconcile it mentally.

I'm going to defy the cubicle gestapo and keep this plastic plant on my desk.
>>>
1994-01-17 *

I...I'd like permission to keep a plastic plant in my cubicle.
>>>
 <<<
Cubicle Gestapo.

 <<<
Permission denied!  Plants attract bugs.  If I can't tell it's plastic how are the bugs going to know the difference.
>>>
 <<<
With all due respect, bugs are way smarter than you.
>>>

Oh yeah?  I'd like to see them do this job.

I invented a stealth business suit to avoid assignments at work today.

What do you think, Dogbert?
>>>
 <<<
Ha Ha!  My sound dampers have cancelled you out!
>>>
 <<<
Now watch what happens if somebody tries to attach a little yellow sticky note to me.
>>>
 <<<
See!  Nothing sticks to the special polymers!
>>>
 <<<
And my wireless phone and pager are encased in lead, so they can't detect incoming calls.

Well, I'm off to 'work'.  Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

There goes the happiest man who ever forgot it was Sunday.

1994-01-15 *

Good news - your ratio of liquidity to stupidity is very low.  You qualify to invest in my reincarnation fund!
>>>
 <<<
If my ratio is low, that means I'm...uh...
>>>
 <<<
Made of liquid!
>>>
 <<<
I'd say you're 98 % water, 2 % cheap suit, and what's left is your amazing brain.
>>>
1994-01-14 * 
<<<
Invest your money in my reincarnation fund and you'll be rich in a future life.
>>>
 <<<
But I am rich in this life, for I have love in my heart and music in my soul.
>>>
 <<<
So, can you help me push my van home?
>>>
 <<<
It looks like you'll also have sharp pain in your muscles.
>>>
1994-01-13 * 
I call it 'Dogbert's Reincarnation Investment Fund'.

He's explaining something that I already understand.  I've got to stop him.

Blah blah blah.

 <<<
I'll try vigorous nodding and agreeing, plus closed body language.
>>>
 <<<
Blah blah blah.
>>>
 <<<
Right right right.
>>>
 <<<
And have I ever told you how 'velcro' works?
>>>
 <<<
Maybe if I block the oxygen to my brain...
>>>
1994-01-11 * 
<<<
Dilbert, I'm forming a small clique of all the young, funny, single people in the department.
>>>
 <<<
We'll have drinks during lunch, talk about ski trips, and have romances within the group.
>>>
 <<<
Please...just shoot me now.
>>>
 <<<
No, no...we need you to do our work.
>>>
1994-01-10 * 
<<<
Let's go around the table and give an update on each of our projects.
>>>
 <<<
My project is a pathetic series of poorly planned, near-random acts.  My life is a tragedy of emotional desperation.
>>>
 <<<
It's more or less customary to say things are going fine.
>>>
 <<<
I think I need a hug.
>>>
1994-01-09 * 
<<<
Maybe I should approach my personal life as if it were an engineering project.
>>>
 <<<
What is the mission of this project?
>>>
 <<<
Find a girlfriend!
>>>
 <<<
Good.  Now consider the feasible alternatives.
>>>
 <<<
Define 'feasible'.
>>>
 <<<
Never mind, let's move on.
>>>
 <<<
Now let's calculate your attractiveness ratio so we can narrow the field of girlfriend options.
>>>
 <<<
Let's see...your buying power narrows the choices to a woman who just got a face transplant from a baboon.
>>>
 <<<
Maybe it was an attractive baboon.  I should call her.
>>>
 <<<
Somewhere between desire and engineering lies stupidity.
>>>
1994-01-08 * 
Boom!
>>>
1994-01-07 * 
<<<
Tim will be leaving the company to pursue other opportunities.
>>>
 <<<
Note the absence of key phrases such as 'we regret' or 'years of dedicated service.'  And notice that his new opportunity is not called 'exciting'.
>>>
 <<<
I think you're reading a little too much into that announcement.
>>>
 <<<
No, I'm reading the footnote.
>>>
1994-01-06 * 
<<<
The boss's brain.
>>>
 <<<
Hummm.

 <<<
Theoretically, if I cut costs enough we'll be profitable without selling any products.
>>>
 <<<
How do they get the ink in these things?
>>>
1994-01-05 * 
We're flattening the organization to eliminate levels and put everyboyd in a wide salary band.
>>>
1994-01-04 * 
We've redesigned the organization chart to show management at the BOTTOM supporting our most important employees!
>>>
1994-01-03 * 
<<<
I'm sorry Dave, but you're being transferred to marketing and there's no budget to train you as a marketer.
>>>
 <<<
Slap!
>>>
 <<<
Where am I?  I need a drink.
>>>
 <<<
This is a temporary fix...but you'll fit in now.
>>>
1994-01-02 * 
<<<
What is reality, Mister Garbage Man?
>>> <<<
Are you sure you're ready for that, Ratbert?
>>> <<<
My mind is a blank slate!
>>> <<<
Time and motion are just illusions created by your inability to perceive everything at once.
>>> <<<
Everything that is possible exists as a path. You simply choose the path you wish to perceive.
>>>  <<<
The only things you can't change are the experiences you've already perceived.
>>> <<<

Dogbert sits behind a counter with a sign that says <<<
End Hunger.
>>>  Dogbert asks a passerby, <<<
Would you like to sign this petition to end world hunger at no cost to you?
>>> The man says, <<<
World hunger?  Why does it say 'I demand elimination of the government and the establishment of a Dogbert monarchy?'
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
It's standard boilerplate.  The lawyers insisted.
>>>  The man says as he signs the petition, <<<
Man, those guys are in a world of their own.

1993-12-30 * 
Dogbert stands on a desk chair.  Dogbert tells Dilbert, <<<
I can't decide if it would be better to conquer the world by building an army or starting a religion.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Which one would have the least loss of life?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
That's what I'm trying to calculate on this spreadsheet.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why are you counting law students as two-tenths of a person?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
It doesn't drop to zero until they pass the bar.
>>> 
1993-12-29 * 
Dogbert and Ratbert look at a globe.  Dogbert says, <<<
After I conquer the world I'll have a city named after you, Ratbert.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
But before I do that I'll change your name to Pittsburgh.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
If you play your cards right I'll change your last name to 'Yoo Hoo' and have a beverage named after you too!
>>>  Ratbert yells, <<<
Yes!  I'm gonna be famous!
>>> 
1993-12-28 * 
Dogbert stands over a map spread out on a table.  Dilbert asks, <<<
What's all this, Dogbert?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I'm planning my world conquest.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
It shouldn't be too hard, given the fact I've probably sneezed more brain cells than the average human uses on election day.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I usually vote a straight party ticket.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I could be done before lunch.
>>> 
1993-12-27 * 
Dogbert says to a salesperon in a store, <<<
I'd like your biggest map of the world for my room.
>>> Dogbert says to the clerk, <<<
I'd like this for free.  In return, after I conquer the world I'll make you ambassador to France.
>>> The salesclerk says, <<<
Does that require travel?  I get air sick.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
No problem.  You'll have diplomatic immunity.

1993-12-26 * 
Dilbert and a woman sit at a table in a restaurant.  The woman says, <<<
You remind me of my old boyfriend Jack.
>>> The woman continues, <<<
You're not as funny or as handsome . . .
>>> The woman continues, <<<
But you ARE male, and that's just like Jack.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I can wait this out.  She'll stop talking about him eventually.
>>> The woman closes her eyes and says, <<<
Ooooh . . . Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack . . .
>>> The woman opens her eyes and says, <<<
Oops . . . I slipped into an 'old boyfriend coma' for a minute there.
>>> Dilbert looks at a menu and thinks, <<<
That wasn't too bad.
>>>  The waiter asks, <<<
Are you ready to order?
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
It should be clear sailing from here on, with any luck at all.

Jack?

Dilbert sits in front of the Christmas tree in his bathrobe.  Dilbert says to Dogbert, who is tearing open his presents, <<<
You really put the family through some major gift-giving guilt this week, Dogbert.
>>> Ratbert asks, <<<
Family?  Does that include little Ratbert?
>>> Dilbert hands Ratbert a gift and says, <<<
Welcome to the family, Ratbert.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Don't expect much of an allowance.

Dilbert sits in his chair reading the newspaper and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dogbert says, <<<
Several shopping hours left, and you just sit there.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Did you really buy enough gifts for Dogbert?  You worry.  Guilt and doubt begin to gnaw at your gut . . . The pain . . . The pain . . .

I thought it was the thought that counts.

Don't believe the hype.

Dilbert sits at his desk and Dogbert sits on the edge of the desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
How can this be the season of good cheer when I don't even have my gifts yet?
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I mean, what if you get me something stupid?  I'll hate you forever and have to run away.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Your psychology won't work this year.  I will not buy more gifts.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
You'll probably find me dead in some snow bank.
>>> 
1993-12-22 * 
Dogbert says to Bob the Dinosaur, <<<
Remember, Bob, it is better to give to Dogbert than to receive . . . Especially at Christmas.
>>> Bob replies, <<<
But I don't have any income . . . Except for the coins people drop when I give them wedgies.
>>> Bob gives a man a wedgie and money falls out of his pockets.  Bob thinks, <<<
It seems like exactly the wrong season to pick up the pace on this sort of thing.
>>> 
1993-12-21 * 
Dogbert hands Ratbert a list and says, <<<
Here's my list of Christmas demands, Ratbert.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Since you have no money I included items which can be easily shoplifted.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
Thanks.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Or you can check the box where it says you agree to be my personal valet for life.
>>>  Ratbert replies, <<<
I need to shoplift a pencil first.

1993-12-20 * 
Dilbert sits on the couch and Dogbert stands on the armrest.  Dogbert hands Dilbert a list and says, <<<
Here's a list of my Christmas demands.

Follow the instructions and nobody gets hurt.

You're bluffing.  You wouldn't hurt my plastic window Santa.

One yank and he's off life support!

1993-12-19 * 
Dilbert kneels in front of a machine.  He tells Dogbert, <<<
My time machine is complete.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I guess you'll be off to explore exotic and fascinating civilizations.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why would anybody want to do that?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Beats me.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
My plan is to send all of our trash to ourselves twenty years from now.  We'll have much better recycling methods by then.
>>> Dilbert puts a bag of trash into the time machine and says, <<<
I wonder what elegant methods we'll have for recycling in the future.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I bet we'll have a way that's quick and efficient and . . .
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>>  They hear a <<<
ping.
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert stand among several bags of trash.  Dilbert says, <<<
We would send it back in time and wait for it to decompose.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I hate us.
>>> 
1993-12-18 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk working on a laptop.  Ratbert says, <<<
I noticed I wasn't in any of your old photo albums, so I pasted myself into a few key places.
>>> Ratbert shows Dilbert the album and says, <<<
Here I am hugging you when you're a baby . . . Basically I put myself over all the pictures of this ugly woman.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That ugly woman is my mom.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
Hey!  I didn't raise you to talk bad about other people!
>>> 
1993-12-17 * 
A woman points at Dilbert's wrinkled clothes and asks him, <<<
What happened to your clothes?
>>> Dilbert answers, <<<
I had them rolled up and stuffed in a 'Pringles' potato chip can for a week.
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
It's a prototype for my tubular luggage invention.
>>>  The woman says, <<<
Never speak to me again.
>>> 
1993-12-16 * 
Dilbert holds a shirt and says to Dogbert, <<<
I need a name for my new tubular luggage invention.
>>> Dilbert rolls the shirt and stuffs it into a can.  Dilbert continues, <<<
The name should be descriptive of its function, yet also call out to my target market.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Go ahead . . . Get it out of your system.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Dorkage.
>>> 
1993-12-15 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Hey, Dogbert!  I just discovered I can fit an entire change of clothes into an empty 'Pringles' potato chip can.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Most of the fabrics I wear can be rolled up pretty tight . . . So . . . Uh . . .
>>> Dilbert walks away thinking, <<<
It's funny how the most brilliant idea can sound silly when you tell your dog.
>>> 
1993-12-14 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Stan, you promised the customer things that engineering can't possibly deliver.  Do you know what this means?!
>>> Stan replies, <<<
It means I'm a great salesman and you're a putrid engineer.
>>> Stan continues, <<<
Maybe you should consider taking classes at night.
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Karate classes.
>>> 
1993-12-13 * 
Dilbert sits at a conference table with Stan and a customer.  Stan says, <<<
And our product has a thirty terabit RAM cache, just like your company needs.  Tell him, Dilbert.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
It has no RAM.
>>> Stan continues, <<<
And it's capable of detecting tachion field emissions.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
You're confusing use with 'Star Trek' again, Stan.
>>> Stan continues, <<<
We'll build that stuff into the next free upgrade.
>>>  The customer replies, <<<
We'll take it!
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Beam me up, Spock.  There's no life on this planet.

Remedy: Todd must be relocated to a distant planet.

It sure is lonely! Hee hee! The caption says, <<<
Case 2: Allen stares at you like a zombie for long periods before responding to questions.
>>> The caption says, <<<
Remedy: Allen must be paired with Virginia (Case 3) who fills all quiet spots with inane chatter.
>>>  Dogbert pushes Virgina toward Allen. The caption says, <<<
Case 4: Matt speaks slowly about amazingly boring topics.
>>>  Matt says, <<<
I . . . ate . . . a . . . pickle . . .
>>> The caption says, <<<
Remedy: Matt's head can be outfitted with a reading stand.

What's the penalty for stealing a chair??

You are sentenced to sit in the break room used by the accounting department.

I like to type the number six.

Cripes!  This is my Tuesday lunch bag.

I summon all the demons and trolls of Heck to come forth and punish you now!!!

I'm Ed, from accounting.  The others are at lunch.
>>> 
1993-12-08 * 
Dilbert sneaks into a cubicle and thinks, <<<
If the warehouse won't replace my broken chair, I'll just take one from somebody else.
>>> Dilbert reaches for a chair and thinks, <<<
Technically, it's not stealing because the chair belongs to the company either way.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
What's the worst thing that could happen?
>>>  Phil the Ruler of Heck stands behind Dilbert and says into a walkie-talkie, <<<
Hold the elevator . . . Over.
>>> 
1993-12-07 * 
Dilbert says to the Boss, <<<
My chair is broken and the warehouse is out of 'engineer chairs.'
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
And since I'm . . . You know . . . Empowered, I thought I might order a 'manager chair' for the time being.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
I've over-stepped my authority, haven't I?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Next you'll want a screen door on your cubicle.
>>> 
1993-12-06 * 
Dilbert stands behind a broken desk chair and says into the phone, <<<
My chair is broken.  Can you send a new one from the warehouse?
>>> A man at a desk replies, <<<
No can do, my friend.  All we have is chairs with deluxe armrests.  They're only for managers who are one level higher than you.
>>> The man says, <<<
What do I suggest?  I dunno . . . Maybe take some classes at night.  I'm sure you can get promoted eventually.
>>> 
1993-12-05 * 
Wally and Dilbert stand at the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, I want you to manage Wally's project while he's on vacation in Aruba.
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
Let the shirk-fest games begin.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Isn't that the week when everything is due?
>>>  Wally says, <<<
Coincidence.
>>> Dilbert says to Wally, <<<
Maybe you could change your plans.
>>>  Wally holds up his airline tickets and says, <<<
Non-refundable tickets right here!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The project can't be important if you won't change your plans.
>>>  Wally thinks, <<<
He's GOOD.
>>> Dilbert tells the Boss, <<<
I'll be happy to add Wally's project to the bottom of my pile and let it fail with Wally's name on it.
>>> Dilbert tells Wally, <<<
When you're in Aruba, study the waiters carefully - it's probably your new career.
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
Two free tickets to Aruba - I win.
>>> 
1993-12-04 * 
Dilbert, Wally and Alice stand in front of Dogbert wearing shorts and t-shirts.  Dogbert says, <<<
Skeptics say that a company fitness program will not succeed.  Let's do some aerobics and see who's right!
>>> Dilbert and the other engineers hit and kick each other as they try to do aerobics. The employees lie in a pile on the floor.  Dilbert says, <<<
The skeptics are right.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
We usually are.
>>> 
1993-12-03 * 
Dogbert stands on a chair across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
Congratulations, Mister Dogbert.  You submitted the lowest bid for creating our corporate fitness program.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
The other bidders wanted money.  You're the only one who offered to do it just for the laughs.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Although I don't see what's so funny about it.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Engineers . . . Aerobics . . . Think about it.
>>> 
1993-12-02 * 
Dilbert says to Matt, <<<
This is your computer.
>>> Dilbert moves the mouse and says, <<<
When you hear footsteps it's a good idea to move this thing around and click it.
>>> Dilbert says as he walks away, <<<
This concludes your technical training.  If you have further questions just remember you're inconveniencing me.
>>> 
1993-12-01 * 
Dilbert, Matt and Wally sit at a conference table.  Dilbert tells Matt, <<<
This is called a 'meeting.'
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
The objective is twofold: talk as much as possible and leave with no new assignments.
>>> Dilbert and Matt leave the meeting.  Matt carries a stack of folders.  Dilbert pats him on the back and says, <<<
That's okay . . . I thought your talking went very well.
>>> 
1993-11-30 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
Matt is fresh out of engineering school.  You'll be his mentor.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Whatever you do, don't crush his spirit before Wednesday.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why put it off so long?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Because I bet ten bucks we could string him along until Thursday.
>>> 
1993-11-29 * 
Dogbert stands on the desk chair.  He says, <<<
The e-mail votes have been tabulated.  The will of the people is that Ratbert shall be spared from getting whacked with a magazine.
>>> Dilbert says to Ratbert, <<<
I guess there's nothing funny about random cruelty.
>>> Bob the Dinosaur gives Dilbert a wedgie and says, <<<
Right!  Cruelty is only funny if administered in a proper social context.
>>> 
1993-11-28 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit in an airplane.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm starving.  Is there a meal on this flight?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
It's probably just a snack.  The airline is cutting back on frills.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
When you say 'snack,' do you mean a small but well-balanced culinary experience?
>>> Dilbert answers, <<<
It's peanuts.  We get nine peanuts apiece.
>>> Dilbert adds, <<<
And a soda . . . But not a whole can, just a little cup . . . Unless they cut back on that too.
>>> The flight attendant tells Dilbert, <<<
Now we just drink a soda ourselves and burp your seat number.
>>> The flight attendant drinks a can of soda. The flight attendant burps, <<<
7B.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
It's actually kind of refreshing.

Dilbert and Dogbert stand under a basketball hoop.  Dilbert says, <<<
You might as well admit I'm a better basketball player, Dogbert.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Never!
>>> Dogbert jumps into the air holding the ball. Dogbert flies over Dilbert's head.  Dilbert shouts, <<<
No fair!  You're hovering!
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
It's just the illusion of 'hang time.'  I learned it from Michael Jordan.
>>> Dogbert floats toward the rim and says, <<<
It's a combination of great leaping skill plus the way I move my legs.
>>> Dogbert dunks the ball. Dilbert points to Dogbert, who hovers in midair.  Dilbert says, <<<
There!  Right there!  That's definitely hovering!!!
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert sit on the couch wearing goggles and gloves.  Dilbert says, <<<
I think you tampered with the virtual reality program!
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Play the game.

1993-11-20 * 
Dogbert says to the garbage man, <<<
Thanks for letting me borrow your phaser.  I recharged the batteries.
>>> The garbage man says, <<<
I hope you didn't use it in anger.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
No, I was laughing most of the time.  And I probably won't stop wagging until Tuesday.
>>>  The garbage man says, <<<
Good.
>>> 
1993-11-19 * 
Dogbert stands at a man's door and says, <<<
I'm looking for the idiot who does the radio traffic reports.
>>> The man says, <<<
Speaking of idiots, only an idiot would want to be in this traffic!
>>> Dogbert zaps the man and says, <<<
That's for making me listen to inane segues.
>>> 
1993-11-18 * 
Dogbert sits on a rock.  A man says, <<<
Hey, little dog, smile.  It only takes two muscles!
>>> Dogbert zaps the man with a phaser pistol.  The man screams. Dogbert says, <<<
That took a few extra muscles, but I think it was worth it.
>>> 
1993-11-17 * 
Dogbert says to the garbage man, <<<
Dilbert won't build a phaser pistol for me.  He thinks it's wrong to zap people for fun.
>>> The garbage man replies, <<<
Yeah, that would be wrong . . . Unless the people you zap are themselves immoral, in which case you would be on the side of justice.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I guess it's academic since I don't have a phaser.
>>>  The garbage man says, <<<
Here, borrow mine.
>>> 
1993-11-16 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the table.  As Dilbert assembles a device, Dogbert says, <<<
I was wondering if you could build a phaser pistol so I can zap the many fools I encounter every day.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Nothing lethal, just enough to make them twitch wildly and scream.  It would be fun.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That wouldn't be very nice to the fools.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I just think you guys should provide more value to society.
>>> 
1993-11-15 * 
Dogbert walks down the sidewalk humming. A man says, <<<
Hey, Dogbert!  Long time no see!

Ow!!

I've never been good at suffering fools.

1993-11-14 * 
Dilbert sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss asks, <<<
So, what have you accomplished this year?
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
I hate performance reviews.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Well, I used my empowerment to create a new paradigm.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
And I teamed across functional boundaries to improve quality.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I dare say I was customer-focused and market-driven!
>>> Dilbert holds his arms out and says, <<<
I proactively found excellence in the midst of chaos!
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I re-engineered my core processes and embraced change!
>>> Dilbert stands up and bows.  He says, <<<
I give you - Dilbert - the perfect employee!
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Was that sarcasm?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
To be honest, I don't know either.
>>> 
1993-11-13 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on the hassock.  Dilbert says, <<<
I made it through the fire-walking seminar uninjured by wearing asbestos lined socks.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
People always laughed because I lined my undergarments with asbestos - but who's laughing NOW?
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Have you always feared your butt would catch on fire?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
It's not the kind of thing you leave to chance.
>>> 
1993-11-12 * 
The instructor says to Dilbert, <<<
I don't think you're ready.

Fire-walking requires complete confidence.  Anything less could be dangerous.

I'm just chilly.
>>>  Dilbert's pants are rolled up and he has socks on his feet.  The instructor says, <<<
Fine . . . Do it with your socks on.

1993-11-11 * 
The instructor asks, <<<
Who will be first to brave the hot coals?
>>> Dilbert, Alice and Wally stand together.  The man pulls Wally out of the crowd and says, <<<
You will teach the others by example.
>>> The instructor says as there is an explosion in the background, <<<
Now, what you learn from Wally's example is: don't use alcohol-based after-shave.
>>> 
1993-11-10 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert and Alice, <<<
I found a seminar that will teach fire-walking as a way to build confidence.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Each of you will have to walk barefoot over burning coals while I watch!
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
But amazingly, we learn how to do it without injury, right?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
No, that seminar costs a lot more.
>>> 
1993-11-09 *

An actual human would feel guilt in this situation.

The pot needs washing.

It says the president can now receive electronic mail.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Really?
>>> Dogbert stands on the desk chair and types, <<<
Dear Mr. President, I would like to make a few suggestions on how to run the country.
>>> Dogbert types, <<<
As you know, the citizens are mostly imbeciles.
>>> Dogbert types, <<<
You should give an executive order for all people to march into the sea.
>>> Dogbert types, <<<
Then, the few of us who are smart enough to ignore you can divide up their stuff.
>>> Dogbert types, <<<
This may seem slightly immoral, but it's better than having a bunch of unwanted people clogging up the country.
>>> Dogbert pauses. Dogbert types, <<<
And we won't have to hear your brother sing anymore.  Sincerely, Ross Perot.

Ratbert's fate depends on the kindness of readers who are voting by electronic mail.

Don't worry, Ratbert.  You won't get whacked unless people think senseless cruelty is somehow 'funny.'

Although I admit it would have a certain visual appeal.
>>>  Ratbert yells, <<<
You're not helping!!

Conclusion Nov. 29.

1993-11-05 * 
Dogbert stands on the desk in front of the computer.  Dogbert says, <<<

The male writers heavily favor whacking Ratbert with the magazine.

And we have a number of helpful suggestions involving power tools.

Boys will be boys.

Dilbert sits in his chair reading a magazine.  Ratbert stands on the hassock with a leash around his neck and says, <<<
It's time to walk the rat!

You're confusing yourself with a dog.  The proper way to exercise a rat is to strike it repeatedly with a rolled-up magazine.

Should Ratbert be spared?  Send your vote by e-mail to: scottadams@aol.com.
>>>  Dilbert holds the rolled-up magazine over Ratbert's head. 
1993-11-03 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Ratbert says, <<<
Yeah, I'd say that I've become a loved and respected member of the family.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
Sure, you had some initial prejudice because I'm a rat, but love won out.
>>> Ratbert concludes, <<<
So, I was thinking maybe there's a better way to leave little bits of cheese around the house for me.
>>>  Ratbert's tail is stuck in a mouse trap. 
1993-11-02 * 
The Boos, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
In Japan, employees occasionally work themselves to death.  It's called karoshi.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I don't want that to happen to anybody in my department.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
The trick is to take a break as soon as you see a bright light and hear dead relatives beckon.
>>> 
1993-11-01 * 
The Boss points to a wall of circular openings and tells Dilbert, <<<
I borrowed a Japanese work custom - sleeping tubes!
>>> The Boss explains, <<<
No more wasted time commuting.  If you keel over from exhaustion we'll just cram you into a sleep tube.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Which tube is mine?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
You don't get a personal tube unless you're employee of the week.
>>> 
1993-10-31 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at a table in a restaurant.  Dilbert tells the waitress, <<<
. . . And no onions.
>>>  The waitress replies, <<<
Very good, sir.
>>> Dilbert hands her the menu and says, <<<
You didn't write it down.  You aren't even intending to get it right.
>>> The server replies, <<<
This way there's no incriminating paper trail . . . Just your word against mine.
>>> The waitress glares at Dilbert and says, <<<
When you complain about getting the wrong meal I'll look at you like this.
>>> The waitress continues, <<<
Then I'll roll my eyes, causing you to wonder whether you misspoke when you ordered.
>>> The waitress continues, <<<
I'll offer to replace the meal but you know that will take forever and also come out wrong.
>>> The waitress laughs hysterically. The waitress asks Dogbert, <<<
And for you?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Number five, hold the demonic hatred.
>>> 
1993-10-30 * 
Dilbert says to the garbage man, <<<
I wish you'd realize that you're a garbage man, not an engineer.  I don't need your suggestions on my designs.
>>> Dilbert looks over the garbage man's shoulder and says, <<<
What are you writing?  Oh yeah, as if I care.
>>> The garbage man hands Dilbert the corrections and says, <<<
If you need help understanding that, the paper boy will be by soon.  I've been working with him.
>>> 
1993-10-29 * 
The garbage man looks in Dilbert's trash can and says, <<<
Hoo-boy!  I hope you're not going to show this to anybody.
>>> The garbage man reads a document and says, <<<
Oh, it's obviously a first draft.  By now you've run it though the spelling checker.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Technologists are concerned with IDEAS, not spelling.
>>>  The garbage man says, <<<
Well, since you brought it up . . .
>>> 
1993-10-28 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk working on his computer.  Ratbert and Dogbert sit on the desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
Don't feel bad because you're awkward, Ratbert.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
There are people leading happy lives who are not only awkward but they're also homely and dull!
>>> Ratbert asks, <<<
Do I have to learn any computer skills?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
It seems like a requirement, but it's not.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Hey!
>>> 
1993-10-27 * 
Dogbert sits on his pillow.  Ratbert says, <<<
I can't remember if I'm left-handed or right-handed.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
I live in fear that I'll be walking in the park, someone will toss me a ball and I'll look . . . awkward.
>>> Ratbert lies underneath a ball.  The person who threw the ball says, <<<
Nice catch, rat.
>>>  Ratbert asks, <<<
Really?  It didn't look awkward?
>>> 
1993-10-26 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Ted sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I need to identify any unnecessary and unproductive employees so I can cut costs.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Does anybody have spare time to join my task force on productivity?
>>> Ted raises his hand and the Boss says, <<<
Good, good . . . Anybody else?
>>> 
1993-10-25 * 
Dilbert hands the Boss a document and says, <<<
Here's my time report, in fifteen minute increments.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
And here's my monthly project status, my budget forecast, my key accomplishments, my jeopardy list . . .
>>> The Boss thinks as Dilbert walks away, <<<
Never has so little been measured so much.
>>> 
1993-10-24 * 
A security guard says, <<<
Have a nice night, Dilbert.
>>> The guard continues, <<<
You can rest easy knowing I'll be guarding the building all night.
>>> The security guard continues, <<<
To a criminal, this place must look like a big ol' shopping mall.
>>> The guard continues, <<<
The cubicles are like little stores, each with it's own selection of quality merchandise.
>>> The guard continues, <<<
If you knew where to look, you could get picture frames, postage stamps, clocks, and even footwear.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Oddly enough, you and the janitor are the only ones here at night, and yet my snack drawer keeps getting emptied.
>>> The security guard looks guilty and says, <<<
It's totally inexplicable.  Well, good night.
>>> The janitor asks the guard, <<<
Shall we head over to 'Chez Dilbert'?
>>>  The security guard replies, <<<
Later . . . There's a sale at 'Wally's Shoe World.'
>>> 
1993-10-23 * 
Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
Hee hee!  How many blondes does it take to change a tire?
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
One?
>>> Wally says, <<<
No, thirty-seven to lift the car and one to pin the diaper on the tire!!
>>>  Wally laughs. Dilbert asks, <<<
Couldn't they just use the jack?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
I wondered about that too.
>>> 
1993-10-22 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert enters the room. Dogbert shouts, <<<
You fool!  You are nothing compared to me!  Ha ha ha ha ha!!
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Have you been speed-reading my self-help books again?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
The idiots should put warning labels on those things.
>>> 
1993-10-21 * 
Alice stands in front of the Boss's desk and says, <<<
I'm working too many hours . . . I never spend time with my family.
>>> The Boss holds up a brochure and replies, <<<
The company cares.  That's why we've developed a program to teach you how to cope.
>>> Alice reads the pamphlet, <<<
Celibacy and adoption - the choice for the nineties.
>>> 
1993-10-20 * 
Alice says to the Boss, <<<
I can't keep working these long hours . . . I deserve a family life.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Alice, Alice, Alice . . .
>>> The Boss says, <<<
This isn't the 'me' generation of the eighties.  This is the 'lifeless nineties.'  I expect 178 hours of work from you each week.
>>> Alice says, <<<
There are only . . . Uh, 168 hours in a week.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
I expect your family to chip in a few hours.
>>> 
1993-10-19 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Alice, it has come to my attention that you are spending time with your family at night.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
That's time that could be used productively to do work for no extra pay.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
Do YOU have a family?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Hmm . . . That would explain the people in my house . . .
>>> 
1993-10-18 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, Wally and Alice, <<<
I just realized I can double your workload and there's nothing you can do about it.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
You're lucky to have jobs in today's economy!  You'll gladly sacrifice your personal lives for no extra pay!
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
But at least our hard work will lead to promotion opportunities.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
You're so cute.  I wish I had a camera right now.
>>> 
1993-10-17 * 
Dilbert tells the Boss, <<<
I didn't work up to my full potential today.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Naturally, I'll be refunding a portion of my salary to the company.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Uh . . . We don't really have a process for that.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What?  That's almost like saying it's okay to work below my potential.
>>> Dilbert screams, <<<
Hey guys!  You were right!  The pay's the same whether you try or not!
>>> Wally says, <<<
That's great!  I didn't do squat today!
>>>  Ted adds, <<<
I played 'Tetris.'
>>> Dilbert tells the Boss, <<<
Thanks for the clarification.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
It's a big time-saver.
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
Hey, I actually got paid for that!
>>> 
1993-10-16 * 
Dogbert and Ratbert sit on the hassock.  Ratbert asks, <<<
Why did you quit your job as company president?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I made a fortune on my stock options and retirement payout.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I'm going to turn my attention to philanthropy.
>>> Ratbert asks, <<<
Is that the study of people named Phil?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
It's mostly about watching people beg and having buildings named after me.
>>> 
1993-10-15 * 
Dogbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
I saved the company a fortune by sending the headquarters staff on one-way business trips.
>>> Dogbert continues as he types, <<<
They haven't wasted money on any stupid projects all day . . . Now I can leak my strategy to the media and exercise my stock options at the uptick.
>>> The caption says, <<<
Somewhere in Iowa.
>>>  Dilbert stands in front of a farm and a dog growls at him.  Dilbert says to a woman who is pointing a rifle at him, <<<
Uh . . . I'm here for a meeting.
>>>  The woman asks, <<<
Did anybody see you?
>>> 
1993-10-14 * 
Dogbert sits at his desk reading the newspaper.  Dogbert says, <<<
What??  The presidents of other companies make way more money than I do!!
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I'd better make some short-sighted cuts.  That should raise our stock price and make my stock options worth millions.
>>> The Boss says to Dilbert, Wally and Alice, <<<
. . . All business trips are one-way from now on . . . And you're all required to take a trip this afternoon.
>>> 
1993-10-13 * 
An employee stands in front of Dogbert's desk and says, <<<
. . . Our pay is too low, and there's no clear leadership.  And we want parking spaces.
>>> Dogbert presses a level and the man falls through a trap door in the floor.  There is a flushing noise. Dogbert thinks, <<<
All things considered, I think I enjoy them more when they're disgruntled.
>>> 
1993-10-12 * 
An executive says, <<<
The motion is approved.  Dogbert is our new company president because he has the best hair.
>>> Dogbert says to a man who follows him taking notes, <<<
. . . Bulldoze the employee cafeteria and put in my helicopter pad . . . And I need a few office improvements . . .
>>> Dogbert points to the floor in front of his desk and says to the assistant, <<<
We need a trap door here, but it won't be funny unless you can give me some 'flushing' sounds.
>>> 
1993-10-11 * 
Dogbert and several executives sit at a conference table.  Dogbert says, <<<
Thank you all for coming to this emergency board meeting.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
As you know, all promotions to senior management are based on hair.  I think we all agree this is the best system.
>>> Dogbert lifts the president's toupee with a pointer and continues, <<<
But have you noticed that I have a rich lustrous coat, whereas our current president gets a little outside help?
>>> 
1993-10-10 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert stand in a parking lot.  A man approaches their car and says, <<<
Hey!  Dilbert!  Is that your nerdmobile?
>>>  The man laughs. Dilbert thinks, <<<
It's my old high school nemesis, Chuck.
>>>  Chuck says, <<<
Maybe you'd like to race me in my Corvette.
>>>  He laughs. Dilbert points to his car and says, <<<
Actually, Chuck, if you had taken a science class you'd know this a 'Seebeck effect' power plant capable of 600 miles per hour.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Any idiot knows you can get massive power simply by using the sun to heat the junction of two dissimilar wires joined at both ends.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Apparently I'm faster AND smarter than you.  And these tax forms show that I also earn more than you.
>>>  Dogbert holds up the forms. Chuck says, <<<
Here's a picture of my new girlfriend.  She teaches aerobics.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
He's winning.  Help me out here, Dogbert.
>>>  Dogbert waves his paw and says, <<<
Step aside.
>>> Dogbert tells Chuck, <<<
I notice that your girlfriend has unusually large hands and a very pronounced Adam's apple.
>>>  Chuck asks, <<<
So?
>>> 
1993-10-09 * 
The caption says, <<<
Dogbert meets the company president.
>>>  Dogbert sits across from the president's desk.  The president says to Dogbert, <<<
You've made quite a name for yourself in the week you've worked here.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
It was easy to grab power, once I realized the other executives were just imbeciles with good hair.
>>> The president says, <<<
I hope you don't think that of ME.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
No, that looks like a toupee from here.
>>> 
1993-10-08 * 
Dogbert stands on a chair across from the Boss's desk and says, <<<
Your entire staff volunteered to work on my task force.  Now I want them and their budgets transferred to me.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Why would I agree to that?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
If you don't, I'll tell everybody you're not a team player . . . Sign here.
>>> The Boss says as he signs, <<<
So . . . Now I'm on the team, right?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Yeah . . . The losing team . . . By yourself.
>>> 
1993-10-07 * 
Dogbert says to Dilbert, Wally and Alice, <<<
Thank you all for volunteering for my task force on 'palmtop personal multimedia.'
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I'm sure that you all have a common vision about this project . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Specifically, you think it will look good on your resumes while being too futuristic to generate any real work.
>>>  Wally thinks, <<<
Mother lode.
>>> 
1993-10-06 * 
Dogbert sits at a desk in front a window thinking, <<<
I've shouted my way into a job and a corner office.  Now I need an empire.
>>> Dogbert says as he types, <<<
I'll start a task force around some hot buzzwords.  Later I'll convert the people into my own division.
>>> Dilbert says to Wally, <<<
Hey, there's a 'Palmtop Personal Multimedia' task force being formed!
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
That one's gonna fill up quick.
>>> 
1993-10-05 * 
Dogbert walks down the hall thinking, <<<
Ha!  My technique of being loud is working.  I got a job and a raise in one day.  Now I need an office.
>>> Dogbert shouts at a man, <<<
Hey!  I want your office now!!
>>> Dogbert stands on the desk watching the man pack his things.  Dogbert yells, <<<
Wait . . . I might be able to use the frame for something!!
>>> 
1993-10-04 * 
Dogbert stands on a chair across from the Boss's desk and shouts, <<<
I'm a loud dog!  Give me a job!  You must obey me because I'm loud!
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Okay okay.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
That was too easy.  There must be something wrong with the job.  It must be an entry level job . . .
>>> Dogbert stands on the desk and kicks something at the Boss.  Dogbert shouts, <<<
I want a raise!!  Promote me, you imbecile!!
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
Bad trend.
>>> 
1993-10-03 * 
Dilbert enters a cave.  A door above the sign says <<<
Bureaucracy.
>>> Dilbert tells a troll sitting at a desk, <<<
I need to buy an upgrade for my computer.
>>>  The troll growls. The troll replies, <<<
First, you must write a business case and get five signatures.
>>>  Another troll jumps onto Dilbert's back. The troll sitting at the desk continues, <<<
Get bids from nine vendors.
>>>  Another troll approaches Dilbert. The troll continues, <<<
All vendors must be approved by a vote of the vendor approval committee.
>>> The troll lists, <<<
. . . Purchase order . . . Budget transfer . . . Legal review . . . Accounting classification . . . Inventory . . .
>>>  Several trolls cling to Dilbert's body. The troll explains, <<<
These steps are necessary to prevent employees from doing something uneconomical.
>>> Dilbert arrives at home with several trolls clinging to his body.  Dogbert asks, <<<
. . . So you suggested a process 'quality audit'?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Yeah, that's the one clinging to my buttocks.
>>> 
1993-10-02 * 
Dilbert and a woman sit at a table in a restaurant.  Dilbert says, <<<
. . . So I knew it was either a layer three protocol error or else it was time to recalibrate the scope.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Ha ha!  I'll avoid the obvious pun about D-channel packet addressing!
>>> The waiter wrestles with the woman for her knife.  Dilbert says, <<<
I don't think she's done with her knife.
>>>  The waiter says, <<<
I know.  I lost three engineers this way.
>>> 
1993-10-01 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
I'm awarding you a 'recognition fuzzy' to commend you for your good work on the project.
>>> The Boss places a piece of lint on Dilbert's shirt and says, <<<
Display it proudly on your shirt.  It's good for morale.
>>> Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
You have pocket lint on your shirt.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Your jealousy is so transparent.
>>> 
1993-09-30 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on the hassock.  Dilbert says, <<<
One of my co-workers got a much better job at another company.  I'm feeling quite envious.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Instead of feeling sad, you should make a list of all the things you have that he doesn't.
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the table writing a list.  Dogbert says, <<<
So far, you have a birthmark, a fear of spiders and the list itself.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I had the birthmark removed.
>>> 
1993-09-29 * 
A man says to Dilbert and Wally, <<<
Next week I'll be at my new job, reaping huge rewards.
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
We're so happy for you.
>>> The man says, <<<
But I'll still have a little cubicle like yours.
>>> The man continues, <<<
The only difference being that I'll keep a pony there.  That way it's close to my office.
>>> 
1993-09-28 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  A man asks, <<<
Have I told you recently that I have a lucrative job offer from our competitor?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Yes.
>>> The man continues, <<<
The pay is obscene, they wear casual clothes at work, and Wednesday through Friday is free beer and pizza.
>>> The man continues, <<<
As the new guy I get to date the masseuse until the company matches me with an attractive co-worker.
>>>  Dilbert covers his eyes and sobs. 
1993-09-27 * 
The foreman of the jury stands and reads, <<<
We find the defendant innocent by reason of being generally clueless.
>>> Dogbert says to Dogbert who is packing his briefcase, <<<
I know I should be happy, but it's so insulting . . . What will all my friends think?
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
. . . Not that I have any.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I call that a win-win scenario.
>>> 
1993-09-26 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert walk through the park.  Dogbert says, <<<
I was thinking about how much I enjoy our conversations.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
They're consistently witty and intellectually stimulating.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Then I realized that all of the witty and intellectually stimulating stuff comes from me.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Naturally I started wondering what was the point of even having you along.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Then I thought about lightning and how it always hits the tallest object.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
So there IS a slight statistical advantage to having you nearby.
>>> A bolt of lightning strikes Dilbert and knocks him off his feet. Dilbert lies on the ground and says, <<<
You aren't going to be witty now, are you?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
How can you say that?  I'm shocked!
>>> 
1993-09-25 * 
Dogbert says to the jury, <<<
Although the insanity defense does not apply to my client, we have something just as good.
>>> Dogbert points to Dilbert and explains, <<<
My client is an 'engineer savant.'  He understands technology but nothing else.
>>> Dogbert pulls Dilbert's foot out from under the table and says, <<<
As evidence, I submit my client's white socks, complete with the sock protector and auxiliary writing tools.
>>> 
1993-09-24 * 
Dogbert says to the members of a jury, <<<
Yes, my client did accidentally slay a 'temp' worker . . . Emphasis on 'TEMP.'
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
But who among us can say they haven't slain innocent people when the situation called for it?
>>> The judge replies, <<<
I can.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Well, great . . . So much for getting a fair trial.
>>> 
1993-09-23 * 
Dilbert sits in a jailroom.  Dilbert says, <<<
I bet I've gone to jail more than the average law-abiding citizen.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I plan to defend you by proving your victim was a temp worker.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
It's legal to kill a temp?  Really??
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Now all we need is a jury of your 'peers.'
>>> 
1993-09-22 * 
Dilbert arrives at home with burned clothes and clouds of smoke rising from his head.  Dilbert asks, <<<
Dogbert, do you know how my light pointer pen could have gotten set to maximum power?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
You never seem to grasp the humor in these situations.  It's not as if you caused any permanent damage in the office.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Actually, I wasted a temp named Carl in the next office.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
A temp - my point exactly.
>>> 
1993-09-21 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss, Alice and Wally.  Dilbert says, <<<
I boosted the power on the pointer pen light so it's easier to see on the wall.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Look how strong it is now.
>>>  Dilbert turns the pen on. The beam from the pen burns the hair off the tops of the Boss's and Alice's heads.  The Boss says, <<<
Let me see that.  I've got a few things to point out.
>>>  Alice says, <<<
Next.
>>> 
1993-09-20 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at a table in Dilbert's lab.  Dilbert says, <<<
I'm adjusting the pointer pen laser light for my presentation tomorrow.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm boosting the power so it's easier to see.  Watch it while I get the phone.
>>> Dogbert turns the power up and the pen glows.  Dogbert says, <<<
The aliens appear hostile, captain.  Set phasers to full power!
>>> 
1993-09-19 * 
The Boss tells Wally and Dilbert, <<<
I just arranged to have my body cryogenically frozen before my death.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
In a hundred years I'll be revived and cured.  That way, future generations will get the benefits of knowing me.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I hope you have a good warm coat.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Coat?  Nobody said anything about needing a coat.
>>> Wally explains, <<<
Obviously you need a coat.  It's freezing in that cryogenic chamber.  You'd better wear long underwear too.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Don't let then tell you otherwise.  Remember, the customer is always right!
>>> The Boss walks away thinking, <<<
I want a space heater in there too!
>>> Dilbert tells Wally, <<<
That wasn't nice.
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
I did it for future generations.
>>> 
1993-09-18 * 
Dogbert and Ratbert sit on the hassock.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Ratbert, did you know that your brain automatically coordinates millions of activities every second?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Imagine if it got just a little bit confused - all those neurons firing randomly . . .
>>>  Ratbert waves his arms and legs uncontrollably. Dogbert says, <<<
You don't add much to a conversation, but you're easily the best listener I've ever met.
>>>  Ratbert screams as he falls off the hassock. 
1993-09-17 * 
Dogbert stands on the Boss's desk next to a large binder.  Dogbert says, <<<
Here's my consulting report on your company.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I had no insights so I bulked it up by adding witty analogies.
>>> The Boss reads, <<<
His head was like a hollow putty ball attacked by two pointy dust bunnies.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Vivid, isn't it?
>>> 
1993-09-16 * 
Dogbert says to Wally, <<<
The company's woes are YOUR fault, not senior management's!
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Do you realize how much YOU could gain personally by making the company a success?
>>> Wally replies, <<<
I would get a nice plaque in a plastic frame.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Yeah . . . I was hoping you didn't know.
>>> 
1993-09-15 * 
Dogbert says to a man sitting at a desk, <<<
The company's problems are your fault, Willy.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
You blame the senior executives, but it is you - the individual employee - who must build innovative new products and pioneer new markets.
>>> Willy says, <<<
But I'm just a word processor.  I was hired to type.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I've seen your typing.  That stinks too.
>>> 
1993-09-14 * 
Dogbert stands on a chair across from the Boss's desk and says, <<<
I'm a 'blame consultant.'"  The Boss thinks, <<<
I've seen him before.
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
For a large fee I will tell the workers that the problems in the company are THEIR fault, not yours.  It's the latest management fad.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Won't they see right through that?
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Is that MY fault??!
>>> 
1993-09-13 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Alice, Wally and Ted sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Welcome to the four hour . . .
>>> The Boss yells, <<<
Meeting from HELL!!
>>>  He laughs diabolically. Dilbert thinks, <<<
That's rarely a good sign.
>>> 
1993-09-12 * 
Dilbert and Wally watch the Boss tell Ed, <<<
Nervous Ed, I'm assigning you to a special project.
>>> Nervous Ed pulls his tie and replies, <<<
Special assignment?  That means you don't have any real work for me.
>>> Nervous Ed continues, <<<
Everybody knows that a special assignment is a kiss of death.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
You'll be sharing a cubicle with six other employees who are also on special assignment.
>>> Nervous Ed looks scared and thinks, <<<
Don't panic yet . . . Maybe it's something important . . . Maybe it's something that could make an impact.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Your assignment is to improve employee empowerment.
>>>  Nervous Ed looks shocked. Nervous Ed convulses and faints. Wally tells the Boss, <<<
Thanks for letting us watch.
>>>  The Boss asks, <<<
Did you like the part about six in the cubicle?
>>> 
1993-09-11 * 
Dilbert walks through the house wearing an apron and thinking, <<<
The water for my spaghetti should be boiling by now.
>>> Ratbert stands in the pot of water on the stove.  Ratbert says to Dilbert, <<<
Oops!  You caught me.  I usually finish hot tubbing before you get back.
>>> Dogbert sits on the hassock and Dilbert sits on the floor leaning against the hassock.  Dogbert says, <<<
It raises a big question mark about the capers.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Capers?
>>> 
1993-09-10 * 
Dogbert aims a video camera at Ratbert.  Dilbert asks, <<<
What are you filming?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Ratbert got his own cable tv channel.
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
Now that cable tv has a thousand channels they're desperate for original programs.
>>> A man and a woman sit on a couch watching television.  The man points the remote control at the tv and says, <<<
Back in the six hundreds I saw a rat slapping his head to a Barry Manilow tune.
>>>  The woman says, <<<
That's worth a second look.
>>> 
1993-09-09 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk and Ratbert stands on the monitor.  Ratbert says, <<<
I figured that you would respect me more if I had some sort of talent.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
So I taught myself to sing Barry Manilow's greatest hits while slapping my head rhythmically.
>>> Ratbert sings, <<<
A-a-at the Copa (slap) ow!  Copa Cabana (slap) ow!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I'm actually enjoying this and it deeply disturbs me.
>>> 
1993-09-08 * 
Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table with a man from marketing.  The man says, <<<
You engineers have done NOTHING on my project.  You just keep saying I haven't given you sufficient requirements!
>>> The man throws his arms up in frustration and says, <<<
I don't know what else you need and you won't tell me what you need!!  Is this just your way of avoiding work??!
>>> Wally replies, <<<
I'll bet you regret choosing marketing as a career path.
>>>  Dilbert adds, <<<
It looks like a lot of work.
>>> 
1993-09-07 * 
Dilbert says to a man who is working furiously at the computer, <<<
Wow!  You temporary contract programmers sure are productive!
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
It must be exciting to know you can be dismissed at any moment.  Your very survival depends on results!
>>>  The man works faster. Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
Let's go blame marketing for not giving us detailed requirements.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
What's the big rush?
>>>  Behind them, the temp works so fast that smoke rises from the keyboard. 
1993-09-06 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
I just love hiring these temporary workers!
>>>  The Boss carries a man over his shoulder. The Boss continues, <<<
No employee benefits . . . No union . . . Just toss 'em in the dumpster when you're done with them!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The dumpster seems a bit inappropriate.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
They're way too big to flush.
>>> 
1993-09-05 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert stands on the hassock holding a stack of documents.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm building a permanent file of all the stupid things you say.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
At least it's only a few pages long.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
This is just the table of contents.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
The full database will be compressed on CD ROMS.
>>> Dogbert points to a man and says, <<<
I hired Juan and his crew to design the system and type in the data.
>>>  Juan says, <<<
We're working overtime.
>>> Juan continues, <<<
The new computer center is done . . . We had to level the neighbor's garage.
>>> Dilbert asks Dogbert, <<<
By any chance, are you still upset that I asked you to fetch my slippers?
>>> Dogbert asks Juan, <<<
Did you get that one?
>>>  Juan writes on his clipboard and replies, <<<
I'll need to hire more people.
>>> 
1993-09-04 * 
Ratbert rides on Bob the Dinosaur's back.  Ratbert says, <<<
As part of our symbiotic relationship I'll shout a warning when danger approaches.
>>> Ratbert shouts, <<<
There's a hole in the ozone layer!  Consumer confidence is down a point!
>>> Bob shouts at Ratbert, <<<
Angry dinosaur with big tail!
>>>  Ratbert's legs and tail stick out of a tree trunk.  Ratbert asks, <<<
You call that symbiotic??!
>>> 
1993-09-03 * 
Ratbert rides on Bob the Dinosaur's back.  Ratbert says, <<<
What a team we make, Bob!
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
Now I won't need to act pathetic to get love.  I'll get all the spillover love that people naturally have for dinosaurs!
>>> Someone says, <<<
Eww!  It's a huge lizard with a talking zit.  I'm gonna be sick.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
Great . . . I got a defective dinosaur.
>>> 
1993-09-02 * 
Ratbert says to Bob the Dinosaur, <<<
Listen to me, Bob.  Individually, we're nothing but a rat and a dinosaur . . .
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
But if we team up we'd have your mighty strength plus my . . . Uh . . . My . . .
>>> Bob asks, <<<
Brain?
>>>  Ratbert replies, <<<
No, that doesn't sound right.
>>> 
1993-09-01 * 
Dogbert stands on a chair and hands Dilbert a form.  Dogbert says, <<<
Here are the Dogbert tax forms.  Pay promptly or you will be penalized.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
It's not fair!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You can't just levy your own taxes; what makes you think I'll pay?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
If not, I'll put you in my new prison.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You mean, you built a prison with the taxes you've already collected?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I think of it as 'infrastructure.'
>>> 
1993-08-31 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Do you realize the government takes half of all the money you make?
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
And the majority of people are too young to vote, or didn't bother to vote, or voted for the loser. . . . And nobody alive voted for our constitution.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
It's never good when you have these insights.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I've decided to levy my own tax on people.
>>> 
1993-08-30 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally, Alice and Ted sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
This thankless assignment shall go to whoever asks a question or makes eye contact.
>>> The employees all look away as the Boss continues, <<<
It's really, really stupid . . . Does anybody want to question it?
>>> Alice slides a pocket mirror across the table.  The Boss says, <<<
I think I see Ted's eyes in the mirror.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Good one, Alice!
>>>  Ted gasps. 
1993-08-29 * 
The Boss tells Dilbert, Wally and Alice, <<<
What we need is more communication between management and . . . Whatever you are.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
So, once a month I'll have 'open door day.'
>>> The Boss explains, <<<
You can drop by and whine about anything you want.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I'll listen with a concerned expression like this.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Then I'll explain why everything is fine just the way it is.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Then, morale will improve, profits will skyrocket and my stock options will make me RICH!! Dilbert says, <<<
May I make some observations about your plan?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Uh . . . Forget it.
>>>  The Boss asks, <<<
Do you notice how concerned I look?
>>> 
1993-08-28 * 
An Elbonian says to Dilbert, <<<
Thank you for teaching us 'quality' techniques.
>>> The Elbonian continues, <<<
Manufacturing defects are down fifty percent since we all joined 'quality teams.'"  The other Elbonian says, <<<
Yes!
>>> The Elbonian asks, <<<
How's our productivity, Yorgi?
>>>  Yorgi replies, <<<
Down fifty percent.
>>>  Dilbert thinks as he walks away, <<<
They're on to me.
>>> 
1993-08-27 * 
Dilbert points to a visual aid and says, <<<
The fishbone diagram helps identify the root cause of problems.
>>> Dilbert continues as three Elbonians listen, <<<
In your case, the root problem seems to be that you're a nation of imbeciles . . .
>>> An Elbonian says, <<<
True, but YOU'RE the one who had to draw a dead fish to figure it out.
>>>  Another man says, <<<
You're in the club!  Here's your hat.
>>> 
1993-08-26 * 
Dilbert says to two Elbonians, <<<
You start by identifying problem areas.
>>> One Elbonian sniffs while another says, <<<
Hmm . . . Sometimes our mittens get stuck to our noses and we can't breathe.
>>> As an Elbonian struggles with his mitten, another says, <<<
Yorgi!  Try to breathe with your mouth!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
People!  Let's talk metrics, please!
>>> 
1993-08-25 * 
Dilbert says to three Elbonians, <<<
I've been sent to teach you 'Total Quality Management.'
>>> Dilbert points at a visual aid that says <<<
Quality equals good (1950).
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
In the old days, quality was just an empty word meaning 'good.'
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Eventually it evolved into a complicated method for transferring your money to business consultants.
>>> 
1993-08-24 * 
Dilbert packs his suitcase.  Ratbert says, <<<
I'll go with you on your trip to Elbonia.  I can be your bodyguard.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
It's not a good place for a rat.  The mud is quite . . .
>>>  Ratbert yells, <<<
You think I'm not tough enough?  I'll show you!!
>>> In Elbonia, an Elbonian points at a bump in the mud next to Dilbert and asks, <<<
And THAT'S your bodyguard?
>>>  Ratbert says from under the mud, <<<
I don't like the tone of your voice.
>>> 
1993-08-23 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  The Boss says, <<<
I'm sending you to our plant in Elbonia.  I want you to teach them 'quality.'
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I selected you because you've been there and you know their language.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
They speak English.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Oh, then I guess it's because I hate you.
>>> 
1993-08-22 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert walk in the park.  Dilbert says, <<<
The great thing about being human is that I'm superior to all other animals.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
On what do you base that absurd conclusion?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Humans have the ability to kill any other animal.  Therefore, we are superior.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You could be slaughtered by chipmunks if they ever decide to gang up.
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
But they wouldn't decide to do that.  That's why humans are superior.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Chipmunks waste their days by eating nuts and playing instead of plotting ways to kill other species.
>>> They sit down under a tree.  Dogbert says, <<<
It's futile to argue with you.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Thank you.
>>> A chipmunk in the tree says, <<<
I say we kill him.  Is anybody with me?
>>> 
1993-08-21 * 
Dilbert walks up behind Albert thinking, <<<
I'll give Albert a male bonding shoulder massage to show I'm a team player.
>>> Dilbert puts his hands on Albert's shoulders and says, <<<
Hey, Al!  Keep up the good work, buddy!
>>> Albert slumps over his desk.  Dilbert thinks as he walks away, <<<
Oops . . . That might have been the Vulcan death grip.
>>> 
1993-08-20 * 
Dogbert says to the Boss, <<<
I sense death . . .
>>> Dogbert and the Boss stand behind Wally's desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
It's coming from here.  Yes, he's definitely dead.
>>> Dogbert says to the Boss, <<<
You should bury him.  He already smells bad.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I'll bet this isn't heaven.
>>> 
1993-08-19 * 
Dogbert, who is wearing a sorcerer's hat, tells the Boss, <<<
I'll use my powers to read the minds of your employees and get ideas for improving morale.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Hmm . . . All they care about is romance, ski trips and 'Star Trek.'
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
How about if we give the high performers little key chains with the company logo?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm getting a blank from this direction.
>>> 
1993-08-18 * 
The Boss says to Dogbert, who is wearing a sorcerer's hat, <<<
I want you to read my boss's mind and tell me what he wants my group to work on.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Why don't you just ask him?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Ask him??  I can't do that.  His calendar is booked for months.  And I never understand what he says anyway.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
He thinks you're an idiot, but it's easier to pay you than to fire you.
>>>  The Boss whistles and says, <<<
Whew!  Job security.
>>> 
1993-08-17 * 
Dogbert sits across from the Boss's desk wearing a sorcerer's hat.  Dogbert says, <<<
I am Dogbert the Psychic Business Consultant.  I can read minds.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
If you can read minds, what's my favorite color?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Your favorite color is puce, but you are mistakenly thinking of a primary color because you don't know what puce is.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Whoa . . . I just got a shiver.
>>> 
1993-08-16 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally, Alice and Ted sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I'm told by a reliable source that our senior vice president made a sound like 'yurp' at lunch.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
What does it mean?  Does it signal a new set of priorities?  We must demonstrate our commitment to this vision.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What was the context of this vision?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
All we know is he was eating a burrito.
>>> 
1993-08-15 * 
The Boss stands behind Ted's desk and says, <<<
Ted, you're part of the company 'right sizing' program, effective today.
>>> Ted replies, <<<
Thank you!  It's nice to get positive feedback from the boss!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's not feedback.  I'm saying your position has been 'management adjusted.'
>>> Ted replies, <<<
Sounds great!  Is there a raise involved?
>>> The Boss says angrily, <<<
Listen to me!!  You're part of 'manager attrition' starting right now!
>>> Ted says, <<<
Wow!  Is that the fast-track program for managers?
>>> Wally tells Dilbert, <<<
I heard that Ted got picked for the 'manager attrition' program.
>>>  Dilbert asks angrily, <<<
Why not us?
>>> Dilbert and Wally stand across from the Boss's desk.  Dilbert says, <<<
So unless you put us on the 'manager attrition' program too, we quit!
>>>  The Boss thinks, <<<
There's never a flamethrower handy when you need it.
>>> 
1993-08-14 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Alice and another employee sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Does anybody have any questions about our plan?  Ask me anything - there are no 'stupid' questions.
>>> A man asks, <<<
If you crossed the international date line on your birthday, would you still get presents?
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
Oh great . . . There ARE stupid questions and I don't know the answers.
>>> 
1993-08-13 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert and Zimbu the Monkey, <<<
After comparing the two of you, I've decided to keep Dilbert for the last engineering job.
>>> Dilbert yells, <<<
Yes!  I win, you little banana-eating-flea-hotel!  Ha ha ha ha!!!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I'm putting Zimbu on the management fast-track.
>>>  Dilbert thinks as he dances, <<<
Bad time for the victory jig.
>>> 
1993-08-12 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert and Zimbu the Monkey, <<<
This next event tests your humor and creativity.
>>> The Boss explains, <<<
The objective is to see how much fun you can have in the barrel.  Who wants to go first?
>>> Dilbert sits inside the barrel and says, <<<
This is no fair.  Zimbu is a monkey.  He has an advantage.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Actually, this is a test of your gullibility.
>>> 
1993-08-11 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert and Zimbu the Monkey, <<<
I can't decide which one of you to lay off, so I've decided to have a contest.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
The first event is the 'staple chase.'
>>> Dilbert has been stapled to a bulletin board.  The Boss says, <<<
Round one: Zimbu.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I think I winged him.
>>> 
1993-08-10 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert and Zimbu the Monkey, <<<
It's going to be tough deciding which of you to lay off.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I want to keep the employee who projects the most professional image.
>>> Dilbert puts his hand behind Zimbu's head and makes a 'V' with his fingers.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
This should make him look pretty stupid.
>>> 
1993-08-09 * 
Dilbert and Zimbu the Monkey sit across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
I've got to cut staff in engineering.  I'm trying to determine which one of you is more valuable to keep.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I've been hearing good things about Zimbu the Monkey.  Which one of you is Zimbu the Monkey?
>>> Dilbert and Zimbu both raise their hands.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
This is not the proudest moment of my professional career.
>>> 
1993-08-08 * 
Dilbert sees a co-worker whose hair stands straight up.  Dilbert asks, <<<
What's wrong with you?
>>>  The man replies, <<<
I have A.W.S.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
You have 'Attractive Woman Syndrome' HERE??
>>>  The man replies, <<<
She was just hired.
>>> The man shouts, <<<
Run!
>>>  The Boss approaches and says, <<<
Dilbert, I'd like you to meet Liz.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Uh-oh . . . My metabolism is increasing.  My brain is suppressing what little social skills I have.
>>>  The woman says, <<<
Hi.
>>> Dilbert extends his hand and says, <<<
It's a pleasure to meet me.  I hope you never find a live turtle in your soup.
>>>  Sweat flies off Dilbert's forehead. Dilbert covers his face with a piece of paper and thinks, <<<
Aaagh!  What was that supposed to mean??
>>>  Liz looks scared. The paper sticks to Dilbert's face and he thinks, <<<
Oh great . . . The correction fluid wasn't dry.  It's stuck to my eyebrows.
>>> Dilbert arrives at home with the document still stuck to his face.  He asks Dogbert, <<<
What can I do to stop frightening attractive women?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
That mask is a step in the right direction.
>>> 
1993-08-07 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair watching television and Dogbert sits on the hassock.  Dilbert says, <<<
This show is garbage.  I will eschew it.
>>>  Dilbert uses the remote control to change the channel. Dilbert and Dogbert watch tv. Dogbert says, <<<
That explains your breath.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
You're in your own little world, aren't you?
>>> 
1993-08-06 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Ratbert says, <<<
I'd miss you if the human race died from pollution but rats lived on.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
So I'm dedicating my life to learning the science of preserving humankind.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Conservation?
>>>  Ratbert replies, <<<
Pickling.
>>> 
1993-08-05 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Ratbert says, <<<
You know, as a rat I'm far more likely to survive a major environmental calamity.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
And there's no shortage of potential disasters - you've got global warming, ozone depletion, air pollution . . .
>>> Ratbert asks, <<<
Can I try on one of your shirts?
>>>  Dilbert looks angry. 
1993-08-04 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair reading the newspaper and Ratbert stands on the armrest.  Ratbert says, <<<
It used to bother me that the air was getting polluted and unbreathable.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
But I realized that rats are hardier than humans - so we'll get all you stuff after you wheeze your last breath!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I think I'll go for a walk.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
Hey!  Why not drive?
>>> 
1993-08-03 * 
Dogbert communicates with the scared volunteers in the dome via cellular phones.  A man says, <<<
Please . . . End the Bioworld experiment.  We're out of food.  Air is almost gone.
>>> The man continues, <<<
We pray there was no sadistic intent when you chose only car salespeople for the experiment . . . Please . . . At least let some air in . . .
>>> Dogbert says as he walks away from the dome, <<<
Gee, I really want to help.  I'll go try to convince my boss to see it your way.
>>>  A volunteer says, <<<
Hey!  I'M a Saturn dealer - I'm different!
>>> 
1993-08-02 * 
Dilbert sits outside the dome and types on a laptop, <<<
With oxygen and food nearly depleted, the Bioworld volunteers become philosophical.
>>> Dogbert and Ratbert communicate using cellular phones.  Ratbert says, <<<
Some of the volunteers think that because they're car salespeople you don't value their lives . . .
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
If that were true, how can you explain that we put you in there too?
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
That's what I said, but it didn't seem to cheer them up.
>>> 
1993-08-01 * 
Dilbert sits on an examining table wearing only his underwear.  He asks, <<<
Is it the flu?
>>>  The doctor looks at a chart and says, <<<
Hmm . . .
>>> The doctor says, <<<
I had the computer run an economic report on the market value of your organs.
>>> The doctor continues, <<<
I could make thousands of dollars by selling your parts for transplants.
>>> The doctor continues, <<<
Of course, this is all moot unless you die in my office while under my care.
>>> The doctor says, <<<
But if I let you die from the flu then my malpractice insurance will go up again.
>>> The doctor continues, <<<
But if you live I can continue to bill you for unnecessary tests.
>>> The doctor continues, <<<
There's a slight economic advantage to keeping you alive . . . If you leave three pints of blood and do me a little favor.
>>> Back at home, Dilbert lies face down on the bed.  He tells Dogbert, <<<
Then I had to wax his Jeep with my clothes.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Apparently he didn't know what kind of fabrics you wear.
>>> 
1993-07-31 * 
Dilbert sits outside the dome and types on a laptop, <<<
Day one of the Bioworld experiment is off to a rocky start.
>>> Dilbert types, <<<
The volunteers have no edible plants and the oxygen level is dropping.
>>>  The volunteers hold signs that say "Help" and <<<
Let us out.
>>> Dilbert types, <<<
Fortunately, most of the volunteers are ex-car salespeople, so we remain emotionally uninvolved.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Look how they spelled 'oxygen.'
>>> 
1993-07-30 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert stand outside a dome and several people stand inside the dome.  Dilbert says, <<<
The Bioworld dome is now sealed.  You must live off its resources for two years.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The edible plants were delivered just before the dome was sealed.  They are the key to your survival.
>>> A delivery man says to the Bioworld inhabitants, <<<
Can somebody open the delivery door?  I've got some plants outside.
>>> 
1993-07-29 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert look at a model of Dilbert's Bioworld experiment.  Dilbert says, <<<
I've completed the design for Bioworld.  Have you selected the volunteers?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Yes.
>>> Dilbert reads a list and says, <<<
So . . . These are the brave people whose lives will depend on my ability to engineer a balanced ecology.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Seven car salesmen plus Ratbert . . .
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Coincidence.
>>> 
1993-07-28 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the table.  Dilbert asks Dogbert, <<<
. . . So I thought you might use some of your newly won millions to fund my 'Bioworld' science experiment.
>>> Dilbert shows Dogbert an illustration and explains, <<<
It's a complete ecology enclosed in an airtight dome.  The survival of the volunteers would depend on my foresight and engineering skills.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Gee, I thought it would be harder to talk you into it.
>>>  Dogbert says as he writes a check, <<<
I get to pick the volunteers myself.
>>> 
1993-07-27 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Does it bother you that I won fifty million dollars in my lawsuit, whereas you still toil to remain middle class?
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Does it bother you to know that I could buy and sell you . . How many times?
>>> A woman with a calculator says, <<<
834 times.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Hey, it's gone up since lunch!
>>> 
1993-07-26 * 
The foreman of the jury reads a document and says, <<<
The jury has reached a decision in the case of 'Dogbert vs. A Big Corporation.'
>>> The man continues, <<<
We award Dogbert fifty million dollars because we hate big companies and we like little dogs with glasses.
>>> The man continues, <<<
And we award a Maytag dryer to juror Mindy for being 'Best Dressed.'"  The judge covers his eyes and thinks, <<<
I hate my life.
>>> 
1993-07-25 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Alice, Wally and an executive sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
You all know our president, Mister Goodenrich.  He's here to answer any questions you have.
>>> Alice asks, <<<
Why aren't there any women or minorities in senior management positions?
>>> Mr. Goodenrich replies, <<<
We think women are for making babies.  As for minorities, we fear them.
>>> Wally asks, <<<
How can you justify your ten million dollar salary when profits are down?
>>> The president laughs and replies, <<<
The board of directors are friends of mine and it's not their money they're spending.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why does the company keep talking about employee training while at the same time slashing the training budget?
>>> The president replies, <<<
We think you're too dumb to train.  We'll hire people from the outside if we need talent.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I must say, your honesty is kind of refreshing.
>>>  The president replies, <<<
And you're all fired for asking questions.
>>> 
1993-07-24 * 
Dogbert says to the members of the jury, <<<
Before you decide who wins this civil suit, remember this . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I can't legally offer you large cash kick-backs for deciding in my favor.  But please take a moment to complete a self-addressed stamped envelope.
>>> The judge asks, <<<
What are you doing?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I'm trying to establish 'reasonable doubt.'
>>> 
1993-07-23 * 
Dogbert stands in front of the judge's bench in a courtroom.  Dogbert says, <<<
For my first witness, I call the defendant's attorney.
>>> Dogbert asks the lawyer, <<<
Is it true that you're wearing women's lingerie right now?
>>>  The lawyer looks surprised and says, <<<
No!
>>> The judge asks, <<<
Is this relevant to your case?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I wonder why YOU're so touchy about this subject.
>>> 
1993-07-22 * 
Dogbert sits at a table with a lawyer.  The lawyer says to Dogbert, <<<
If you do not drop your class action suit, then you'll have to face ME in court.
>>> The lawyer continues, <<<
And I've never lost a case.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Then how do you know you wouldn't enjoy it.
>>> The man replies, <<<
Well . . . I just wouldn't.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Good argument.
>>> 
1993-07-21 * 
Dogbert stands on a chair across from the Boss's desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm from the law firm of Dogbert, Dogbert and Dogbert.  I'm suing you for draining the life force out of your employees.
>>> Dogbert holds a rag and says, <<<
After being drained of life, employees are forced to leave the company.  The lucky ones get jobs as rags for a car wash, like Joey Pishkin here.
>>> The Boss blows his nose on a rag.  Dogbert says to the rag he's holding, <<<
What Joey?  That's Marge from accounting???
>>> 
1993-07-20 * 
Dogbert says to a group of rags, <<<
I'll be representing you corporate employees in a class action suit.  Your company has sucked the life force out of you and turned you into little rags.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
My fee will be on a contingency basis.  That means I get the entire settlement plus I'll use you to wax my BMW.
>>> One rag replies, <<<
Sounds fair.
>>>  Another thinks, <<<
Don't make waves.
>>>  Dogbert thinks, <<<
I've found the perfect clients.
>>> 
1993-07-19 * 
The Boss says to an employee, <<<
Your new project will have no budget and no management support.  Expect to spend most of your time giving status reports.
>>> The man's head disappears and he thinks, <<<
Oh no!  The life force has been drained out of me!  I'm becoming a damp rag!!!
>>> Dilbert looks at the floor and says, <<<
That's amazing.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
It's nothing.  I did eighteen at once at the employee empowerment brunch.
>>> 
1993-07-18 * 
The Boss and Dilbert stand in front of a room of people.  The Boss says, <<<
The award for best attendance goes to Dilbert.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'd like to thank the people who made this possible.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
First, I'd like to thank the women in the company who have rejected me over the years . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Because of them I have no germ-riddled children to infect me.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
And thanks to my co-workers for never telling me about important meetings, thus keeping my germ exposure to a minimum.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
And thanks to my boss for never assigning a project important enough to induce stress and weaken my immune system.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But what makes this award special is that each of you had to get sick in order for me to win.
>>> Dilbert arrives at home and says, <<<
When you have your health, you have everything, Dogbert.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
No, you also have to gloat.
>>> 
1993-07-17 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk and Ratbert sits on the desk.  Ratbert says, <<<
Sometimes I think I'm not reaching my full potential as a rat.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
You're right.  In the Middle Ages, disease-carrying rats wiped out half of the human population of Europe.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
I think I've got a little temperature.  Feel my forehead.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Face it, your glory days are past.
>>> 
1993-07-16 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, <<<
Our newest fad policy is to have subordinates appraise their boss's job performance.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I give you a 'D minus.'
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Did I mention retribution?
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Careful, sir, you're hanging by a thread.
>>> 
1993-07-15 * 
Ratbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I think I've hit upon a brilliant new direction for expanding our product line.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
I call them 'Carpet Patch Kids.'  Each one is made from carpet and has its own name!
>>> Ratbert says to the carpet doll as he walks away, <<<
Don't feel bad, Raquel.  I don't think he meant it as a personal attack.
>>> 
1993-07-14 * 
Dogbert stands on a desk chair counting money.  Dilbert says, <<<
It looks like sales of the 'Dogbert Joggerobic Carpet Patch' are brisk.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Yeah, and I'm looking to expand.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Ratbert is busy researching new product concepts for the carpet patch.
>>> Ratbert holds the carpet patch on his head and thinks, <<<
Carpet Club for Men.
>>> 
1993-07-13 * 
Ratbert stands in front of the television.  An announcer asks, <<<
Are you tired of fad diets and fad exercise devices?
>>>  Ratbert replies, <<<
Yes, I am!
>>> Dogbert appears in the commercial and says, <<<
Then buy my book and get the revolutionary Joggerobic Carpet Patch for only $19.95 plus shipping and handling.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
To prove it works, we photographed an actual athlete.
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
Pictures don't lie!
>>> 
1993-07-12 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert stands on the hassock.  Dogbert hands Dilbert a book and says, <<<
I thought of another way to profit from the ignorance of humans.
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
I wrote 'The Dogbert Formula for Health.'  I recommend a daily dose of food, sleep and exercise.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
And for only $19.95 you can buy the patented 'Dogbert Joggerobic Carpet Patch' to help you run in place.
>>> 
1993-07-11 * 
Dilbert bends over tying his shoelace. He tells Dogbert, <<<
Maybe I'm unlucky in love because I'm so knowledgeable about science that I intimidate people.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Their intimiidation becomes low self-esteem, then they reject me to protect their egos.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Occam's razor.
>>> They walk through the park.  Dilbert asks, <<<
What is 'Occam's razor'?
>>>  Dogbert answers, <<<
A guy named Occam had a rule about the world.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Basically, he said that when there are multiple explanations for something, the simplest explanation is usually correct.
>>> They sit down on some rocks.  Dogbert continues, <<<
The simplest explanation for your poor love life is that you're immensely unattractive.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Maybe Occam had another rule that specifically exempted this situation, but his house burned down with all his notes.  Then he forgot.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Occam's razor.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
I'm an idiot?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I don't think we can rule it out at this point.
>>> 
1993-07-10 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair reading a book and Dogbert stands on the hassock holding a plate.  Dogbert says, <<<
You already own the 'Acorn Series' of Dogbert's Commemorative Plates . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
For a limited time you may also purchase my new issue: the 'French Guy With a Hat' series.
>>>  Dogbert has drawn a face on the acorn. Dilbert says, <<<
My acorn plates are missing.
>>>  Dogbert sits on his pillow thinking, <<<
Tomorrow I'll introduce my new series: 'Russian With French Hat.'
>>> 
1993-07-09 * 
Dilbert sits down at the table where Dogbert is writing on plates.  Dilbert asks, <<<
What are you making?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Commemorative collectible plates.
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
One of the mysteries of life is that you can put any picture on a plate and hordes of morons will want to own it.
>>> Dilbert holds up a plate and says, <<<
Wow!  An acorn!  And it's on a plate!
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
What's it like to be a member of a horde?
>>> 
1993-07-08 * 
Two government agents holding guns stand behind Dilbert while he works at his desk.  One agent says, <<<
Erase all the formulas for making your 'Happiness Potion' and we won't jail you.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Okay, okay . . .
>>> The agent says, <<<
You citizens only have the right to PURSUE happiness - you're not allowed to BE happy.
>>> The other agent says, <<<
Citizens need discomfort in order to be productive and fulfilled.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Then you'll love this . . .
>>>  Bob the Dinosaur reaches for the agent's underwear and thinks, <<<
Wedgie.
>>> 
1993-07-07 * 
Dilbert opens his door and two agents wearing dark sunglasses and holding guns show him their identification badges.  The agent says, <<<
We're the government.  We came to confiscate your so-called 'Happiness Drug.'
>>> As the agent holds his gun to Dilbert's nose, Dilbert says, <<<
It's not a drug!  It's just a mixture of fruits and vegetables that makes you feel happy!  You can't outlaw good nutrition!
>>> The other agent says, <<<
Hmm . . . I guess that wouldn't make sense, would it?
>>>  The agent says, <<<
Ignore him.  He's a new guy.
>>> 
1993-07-06 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk working with test tubes and beakers of chemicals.  Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
I've identified the brain chemical that controls happiness.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
And I found the exact mix of fruit and vegetable juices that stimulate its production.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Do you realize what this means?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Yeah.  Fruits and vegetables will be banned by the government.
>>> 
1993-07-05 * 
The Boss, Alice, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
Let's start with a brainstorming exercise.  Alice, you go first.
>>> Alice closes her eyes and says, <<<
I imagine myself not surrounded by dull, unattractive, and largely clueless men.
>>> Alice says, <<<
Mmmm . . .
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I think she just insulted you guys.
>>> 
1993-07-04 * 
Dilbert sits in a chair and sighs. Ratbert walks into the room and says, <<<
Hey hey!  What's this?  Are we feeling blue?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Go away, Ratbert.
>>> Ratbert thinks, <<<
This could be my chance to bond and become a valuable member of the family.
>>> Ratbert grabs Dilbert's shoe and says, <<<
I'm going to hug your foot until you turn that frown upside down.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
Now tell me why you feel sad.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
I just walked through something disgusting with my new shoes.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
One of us isn't trying to make this relationship work.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Could you do the other shoe now?
>>> 
1993-07-03 * 
Dilbert stands next to an overhead projector.  Dilbert puts a transparency on the projector and says, <<<
Please excuse the artwork in this next diagram.
>>> Various people in the background say, <<<
What's that?  It looks like Elvis's face on a credenza!  Ha ha ha!  Or is it a Rorschach test??!  Ha ha ha!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
And in conclusion, I hate you all.
>>> 
1993-07-02 * 
Dogbert sits on the hassock.  Dilbert enters holding a piece of paper and says, <<<
Dogbert, tell me if you think my illustration for tomorrow's presentation is clear.
>>> Dogbert looks at the illustration and says, <<<
Ah, yes.  You're saying the face of Elvis will appear on a credenza after being struck by lightning.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's supposed to be a video teleconference.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I didn't know you could do that with a credenza.
>>> 
1993-07-01 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk and says, <<<
My patent will make fifty million dollars for the company, so I thought maybe you could afford to give me a raise.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Unfortunately, the profit bucket is not connected to the budget bucket, so there's no money for a raise.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I think some recognition of a job well-done is appropriate here.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Thanks.  It WAS one of my better excuses.
>>> 
1993-06-30 * 
Alice asks, <<<
Dilbert, would you add my name to your patent application?
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Why should I?
>>> Alice replies, <<<
I would consider upgrading your status from 'co-worker' to 'friend I never see outside of work.'
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Would we eat lunch together?
>>>  Alice replies, <<<
No, but I'll pencil you in and cancel at the last minute.
>>> 
1993-06-29 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  The Boss says, <<<
Add my name to your patent application to acknowledge my contribution.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
What contribution?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You said it was a stupid idea by a stupid employee.  You ordered me to stop working on it.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Devil's advocate!
>>>  Dilbert adds, <<<
You also said I was ugly.
>>> 
1993-06-28 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
My patent application is complete.  Soon the other engineers will come sniffing around.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
They are attracted by the scent of success.  They want their names on my patent.
>>>  Wally, Alice and Ted peer into Dilbert's cubicle. Alice says to Wally and Ted, <<<
The scent CAN'T be coming from here.
>>>  Ted says, <<<
We may be getting a false positive from his baloney sandwich.
>>>  They all sniff the air. 
1993-06-27 * 
The Boss, Dilbert and Wally sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
We can succeed if each of you will commit to giving 110 percent.
>>> Wally says, <<<
That would be ten percent over the theoretical maximum.
>>>  Dilbert adds, <<<
Can't be done.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Plus you have your vacation days and your sick days . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Heck, these staff meetings take ten percent right off the top . . . Wally asks, <<<
And what about all the times something unexpected comes up?
>>> Wally says, <<<
I think we could give you . . . What?
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Forty-three percent.
>>> Wally adds, <<<
And that's not a commitment.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
It's an estimate.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Can we continue the meeting now?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I'm over my estimate for today.
>>> 
1993-06-26 * 
The Boss lifts the coffee pot and Alice stands behind him waiting to get some coffee. Alice squeezes one side of the Boss's hair. The Boss's hair stands straight up.  Alice says, <<<
In retrospect, that was exactly the kind of temptation I should just ignore.
>>> 
1993-06-25 * 
Alice walks down the hall thinking, <<<
I am Alice the Compulsive Grabber.
>>> Alice thinks, <<<
When I see things that are not right I must grab them.
>>> Alice grabs Dilbert's tie.  Dilbert says, <<<
In an hour or so I may have to ask you to stop that.
>>> 
1993-06-24 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk working on his computer.  The Boss says, <<<
Yesterday we ran out of acronyms.  Today we used our last accounting code.  We're in big trouble.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why don't we just reprogram the computers to accept longer codes?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
A project like that would need an acronym and an accounting code.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why not reuse a code from a project that's complete?
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Oddly enough, we've never completed a project.
>>> 
1993-06-23 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Ted sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
As you know, all projects are assigned acronyms.  Unfortunately, all the good ones have been used.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Any new project will have to use an acronym from this short list of somewhat less desirable choices.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What should I call my new project?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Well, you could use 'PHLEGM' or 'PLACENTA.'
>>> 
1993-06-22 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk staring at his computer.  He has dishes stacked on top of his head.  Ratbert asks Dogbert, <<<
What are those dishes doing on Dilbert's head?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
He's in a video game trance.  I'm testing my theory that he is unaware of his environment and has no discernible mental activity.
>>> Ratbert walks away with dishes stacked on his head.  Ratbert thinks, <<<
Poor guy.
>>> 
1993-06-21 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk working on his computer.  Dogbert thinks, <<<
I've seen that look before.  He's in a video game trance.
>>> Dogbert thinks, <<<
He can't move.  I've got to do something fast.
>>> Dogbert stands on a ladder and stacks dishes on Dilbert's head.  Dogbert says, <<<
Lassie might have handled this differently.
>>> 
1993-06-20 * 
Dilbert and a woman sit at a table.  The woman says, <<<
We always used to go to the . . .
>>>  Someone blows a whistle. Dogbert approaches Dilbert from behind shouting, <<<
Stop the action!
>>> Dogbert points at the woman and says, <<<
That's a penalty for talking about an old boyfriend!
>>> Dogbert points at Dilbert and says, <<<
The opposing date gets one minute to talk about a sports event!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Then Mullin hits the jump shot . . .
>>>  Dogbert blows the whistle. Dogbert says, <<<
Penalty!  Staring at the waitress for no legitimate reason!!
>>>  The woman thinks, <<<
Yes!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
The visiting team gets one minute to discuss 'feelings.'
>>> The woman says, <<<
I think of you in the 'friend' category.
>>>  Dogbert waves his paws and shouts, <<<
Score!!
>>> 
1993-06-19 * 
Dogbert says to the seminar participants, <<<
As a zombie, you must speak in empty generalities.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Your business plan might say 'We strive to utilize a variety of techniques to accomplish a broad spectrum of results toward the bottom line.'
>>> A man says, <<<
Hey!  My skin is getting clammy and I have the urge to call a meeting!
>>>  The man sitting next to him says, <<<
Me too!
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Good . . . Good . . .
>>> 
1993-06-18 * 
Dogbert stands on top of a beverage container and says, <<<
To be a zombie you must drink the zombie elixir.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
The zombie elixir will remove any distracting thoughts of sleep or family life.
>>> A man looks in his mug and says, <<<
It looks like coffee.
>>>  Dogbert holds a giant spoon of sugar and says, <<<
You have to add one scoop of zombie sugar.
>>> 
1993-06-17 * 
Dogbert stands in front of an audience and says, <<<
The successful zombie knows how to squash the creativity of co-workers.
>>> Dogbert points to a picture of a man with bags under his eyes and says, <<<
When you hear a new idea, adopt a facial expression which conveys both fear and an utter lack of comprehension.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Those of you who work in marketing only need to add the fear part.
>>>  Someone asks, <<<
Why is that?
>>> 
1993-06-16 * 
Dogbert points to a picture of a man with a lightbulb over his head.  Dogbert says, <<<
Many of you come to my management seminar as optimistic, creative, clear-speaking individuals.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
But with hard work, you can become jargon-spewing corporate zombies, like Carl here.
>>>  Dilbert sits in the audience. Carl sits in a chair looking straight ahead and saying, <<<
I want to dialogue with you about utilizing resources.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Good boy!  Here's a donut.
>>>  Dogbert tosses him a donut. 
1993-06-15 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  The Boss says, <<<
I got a brochure for 'Dogbert's Seminar on Management Zombies.'  I think you should go.
>>> Dilbert reads the pamphlet, <<<
Learn how to use words like: utilize, paradigm, vertical, empowerment, and proactive in every sentence.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm not sure I want to talk like that.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Come . . . Join us . . . Don't be afraid . . .
>>> 
1993-06-14 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally, Alice and Ted sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I took a crack at writing a 'mission statement' for our group.
>>> The Boss reads, <<<
We enhance stockholder value through strategic business intiatives by empowered employees working in new team paradigms.
>>> Dilbert asks Wally, <<<
Do you ever just marvel at the fact we get paid to do this?
>>>  The Boss asks, <<<
Did anybody bring donuts?
>>> 
1993-06-13 * 
Dilbert stands in a shoe store.  A salesperson asks, <<<
Can I help you?
>>> Dilbert tells the salesman, <<<
I oppose the slaughter of helpless animals.  Do you have any shoes that aren't made of leather?
>>> The man replies, <<<
Yeah, but they would make you look like a twit.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Well, forget that.  Do you have any shoes made in this country?
>>> The salesman replies, <<<
Yeah, but they cost more.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Okay, forget that.  Just show me some shoes that weren't made with slave labor.
>>> The man says, <<<
We charge a premium for no-slave shoes.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Well, forget that.
>>> Dilbert arrives at home with a shoebox.  Dogbert asks, <<<
How much did you sell your soul for?
>>>  Dilbert answers, <<<
Forty bucks and a little shine cloth.
>>> 
1993-06-12 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk thinking, <<<
There . . . I've organized all of my tasks into 'A,' 'B' and 'C' priorities.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
The 'A' priorities aren't even worth doing.  And the 'B' priority stuff would probably get me in trouble.
>>> Dilbert asks Wally, <<<
Are you done with the stapler oil?
>>>  Wally holds up a polished stapler and says, <<<
Thank goodness for 'C' priorities.
>>> 
1993-06-11 * 
Dogbert stands on the desk chair working on the computer.  Ratbert asks, <<<
Aren't you afraid that if you continue as leader of the nerds, you will become a nerd yourself?
>>> Dogbert answers, <<<
No, because you can't become a nerd unless you have a genetic predisposition toward it.
>>> Dilbert enters the room and says, <<<
Look!  I added an emergency backup pocket!
>>>  Dogbert says to Ratbert, <<<
See?  You can't learn that stuff in computer class.
>>> 
1993-06-10 * 
Dogbert sits across from a man's desk and says, <<<
I am Dogbert, leader of Venod - a huge collective of nerds.  We demand twenty percent discounts on all of your products.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
If you refuse, I will send a wireless e-mail message that instructs one million nerds to stop buying your products.
>>> The executive asks, <<<
You're kidding, right?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
There - I just sent them your daughter's phone number.
>>> 
1993-06-09 * 
Dogbert stands on a desk chair working on the computer.  Dilbert says, <<<
Now that you've united the electronic mail users of the world, what are you going to do?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I'll poll them about their needs, then use their collective political and economic power to get them whatever the majority wants.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Couldn't you easily rig the vote to support your own selfish ambitions?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I love the democratic system.
>>> 
1993-06-08 * 
Dogbert stands on a desk chair and types on the computer, <<<
This is Dogbert, with a broadcast e-mail message to all computer geeks . . .
>>> A man reads Dogbert's message on his computer.  The message says, <<<
I declare myself to be your leader, and I name my empire the 'Virtual Electronic Nation of Dogbert,' Venod for short.
>>> Dilbert looks over Dogbert's shoulder and says, <<<
I assume you'll be exploiting the simple people of Venod for personal gain.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Yeah, it's a leadership tradition.
>>> 
1993-06-07 * 
Noriko stands on the sidewalk and says to the Boss, <<<
Stop right there, Mister Adult!  You've got some explaining to do to my generation!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
It's quite simple, really.  Children have no political power.  So we adults can plunder the planet, run up huge debts, then die fat and happy!
>>>  Bob the Dinosaur lifts the Boss's suit coat. Noriko says as she and Bob walk away, <<<
I've never seen anybody lifted by his briefs and spun in the air like that.
>>>  Bob says, <<<
That's my 'twirling wedgie.'
>>> 
1993-06-06 * 
The Boss tells Dilbert, <<<
It's time for your annual performance review.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
The process is the same as usual.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Make your accomplishments fit the trendy categories on this form.
>>> Dilbert reads, <<<
'1. Estimate the cash value of the empowerment you displayed this year.  Cite examples.'
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Try to make your accomplishments match the raise I've already decided for you.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why don't you just tell me what you've decided?
>>> The Boss responds, <<<
What - and ruin the motivational value of the process??
>>> The Boss thinks as he walks away, <<<
How did I get stuck with all the cynical employees?
>>> 
1993-06-05 * 
Dogbert says to Noriko, <<<
Take Bob with you, Noriko.  You'll need help saving the planet for your generation.
>>> Noriko and Bob the Dinosaur walk down the sidewalk.  Noriko says, <<<
I have a black belt in karate.  What skills do you bring to the party?
>>>  Bob replies, <<<
Wedgies, mostly.
>>> Bob picks a man up by his underwear and explains, <<<
It's not as menacing as karate, but you have to love the expressions on their faces.
>>>  Noriko says, <<<
Turn him this way.
>>> 
1993-06-04 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
Noriko, I'd like you to meet Bob the Dinosaur.
>>>  Noriko and Bob say "Hi" to each other. Noriko says, <<<
I thought dinosaurs were all extinct.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
No, they were just hiding.  We found Bob behind the couch.
>>> Noriko says, <<<
I wish we had one at our house.
>>>  Bob says, <<<
Look in your credenza.  The Belmonts live in the 'Krazy Glue' drawer.
>>> 
1993-06-03 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit on the grass.  Noriko stands between them saying, <<<
You adults are ruining the planet for my generation.
>>> Noriko continues, <<<
We kids have no power now, but I'm taking names.  When we take power we'll ship you all to a penal colony on Mars.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
There's no oxygen on Mars.
>>>  Noriko says, <<<
Oh, NOW you learn to plan ahead.
>>> 
1993-06-02 * 
Dogbert, Dilbert and Noriko sit on a park bench.  Noriko yells at Dilbert, <<<
You adults have totally messed up the planet!!  Where's the accountability??!
>>> Noriko continues, <<<
You know our implied social contract!  You take care of the kids, then we take care of you when you're old.  That's how it's supposed to work.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Well, I . . .
>>>  Noriko yells, <<<
The deal is OFF!!
>>> 
1993-06-01 * 
Dogbert and Noriko stand on the sidewalk.  Noriko yells, <<<
Who the heck is running this planet??!  It's a total disaster!!
>>> Noriko yells, <<<
The environment is a mess!  Crime and poverty are everywhere!!  Who's responsible?!!
>>>  Dogbert points to someone and replies, <<<
Adults, like him.
>>> Dilbert walks up to them and says, <<<
Hi, Noriko.  Is something wrong?
>>>  Noriko replies, <<<
Duhhh!
>>> 
1993-05-31 * 
Dogbert and Noriko sit on a park bench.  Noriko says, <<<
I can't wait to grow up and get out of school.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Actually, Noriko, your generation will have to take classes and work full-time your whole lives . . . Assuming any jobs exist.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
But on the plus side, television will have a thousand channels.
>>>  Noriko yells, <<<
That's it; somebody's got some explaining to do!
>>> 
1993-05-30 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Do you think the chemistry of the brain controls what people do?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Of course.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Then how can we blame people for their actions?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Because people have free will to do as they choose.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Are you saying that 'free will' is not part of the brain?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Of course it is, but it's the part of the brain that's out there just being kind of free.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
So, you're saying the 'free will' part of the brain is exempt from the natural laws of physics.
>>> Dilbert answers, <<<
Obviously, otherwise we couldn't blame people for anything they do.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Do you think the 'free will' part of the brain is attached or does it just float nearby?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Shut up.
>>> 
1993-05-29 * 
Dogbert sits on a park bench with a woman and a little boy.  The woman says, <<<
Our school system is a complete failure, Dogbert.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Why's that?
>>> The woman replies, <<<
The schools should be preparing these kids to be scientists and engineers.  That's the only way our economy will prosper.
>>> The woman continues, <<<
Instead, we'll be a nation of maids and janitors.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Yeah, but think how clean it will be.
>>> 
1993-05-28 * 
A woman holding a device stands behind a man at a desk.  The woman thinks, <<<
There's another unproductive man, daydreaming about attractive women.
>>> The woman thinks, <<<
A short burst from my 'defantalator' should set him straight.
>>>  The woman uses the device. As the woman walks away, the man says, <<<
Hey!  I think I'm starting to like figure skating!
>>> 
1993-05-27 * 
A woman stands in front of the Boss's desk holding a device.  The woman says, <<<
My 'defantalator' invention can eliminate the unproductive and naughty thoughts of your male employees.
>>> The woman continues, <<<
We succeeded in getting men to stop ACTING like men, but it wasn't enough.  Men must stop THINKING like men too.
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
Hmm . . . A little makeup and a new hairdo . . .
>>>  The woman points the invention at the Boss and says, <<<
Hey!  Cut it out!
>>> 
1993-05-26 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, Wally and Ted, <<<
I understand that you men are spending three quarters of your time daydreaming about attractive women.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Do you realize how much time is being wasted here?
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Twenty-five percent?
>>>  Wally says, <<<
It's a trick question.
>>>  Ted thinks, <<<
Irene.
>>> 
1993-05-25 * 
Wally says to Dilbert and Ted, <<<
My productivity is shot.  I can't stop daydreaming about Irene in accounting.
>>> Ted says, <<<
Do what I did.  Try to phase out of it by daydreaming of Laura in engineering, then move to the ordinary-looking Betty in marketing.
>>> Wally replies, <<<
Now I'm daydreaming about all three of them.
>>>  Ted replies, <<<
Same thing happened to me.
>>> 
1993-05-24 * 
Wally leans back in his desk chair sleeping.  The Boss says, <<<
Hey, what are you doing?  Are you sleeping?
>>> Wally sits up and says, <<<
Uh . . . No, I was brainstorming.
>>>  The Boss asks, <<<
What idea did you some up with?
>>> Wally answers, <<<
It involves Irene in accounting.  She's the stern nurse and I'm the incorrigible industrialist.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
I already thought of that one.
>>> 
1993-05-23 * 
A teller at the Bank of Ethel says, <<<
Next victim.
>>> Dilbert approaches the window and says, <<<
You charged me a fee for paying my credit card bill a day late.
>>>  The woman asks, <<<
So?
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why don't your computers automatically transfer money from my checking account instead of charging a penalty?
>>> The teller replies, <<<
Frankly, we're not much into the 'customer service' craze.
>>> The teller continues, <<<
We prefer to set little traps so customers get hit with unexpected penalties.
>>> Dilbert says angrily, <<<
Well!!  I think I'll just take my business elsewhere!
>>> The teller says, <<<
You're annoying me.  That's a hundred dollar penalty!
>>> Dilbert walks out of the bank wearing only his underwear.  He thinks, <<<
I don't think I can even claim a moral victory here.
>>> 
1993-05-22 * 
Dilbert sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
Good report . . . But add a sentence that says micro-robotics is a dead-end technology.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
But that's the exact opposite of my point!  If I add that, the whole report would be a confusing and senseless waste of time!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
That's okay.  We just won't let anybody else see it.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Is this a win-win scenario?
>>> 
1993-05-21 * 
At company headquarters, someone asks, <<<
Does anybody have a plan for getting rid of the employees?
>>> Another person answers, <<<
Well, they're bad at math; we could offer deceptively small sums of money to people who retire.
>>> Dilbert, Wally and Alice read copies of a document.  Dilbert says, <<<
Hey, this could be good.
>>>  Wally says, <<<
It's been a long time since I had to calculate the cosine of anything.
>>> 
1993-05-20 * 
Dilbert stands at the door with a two-headed woman.  The woman says, <<<
You're wondering how to handle the good night kiss . . .
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Uh . . .
>>> Donna says, <<<
By a vote of two to zero we've decided not to kiss you.  And Debbie has threatened a filibuster on the handshake issue.
>>> Dilbert holds his hand out and thinks, <<<
It's a bluff.
>>>  Debbie says, <<<
Nice weather today.  Have you seen any good movies?  How about the economy, huh?
>>> 
1993-05-19 * 
Dilbert sits at a table in a restaurant with a two-headed woman.  Dilbert says, <<<
Believe it or not, this is the first time I've ever dated a two-headed telepath.
>>>  The women look frightened. Dilbert says, <<<
You might pick up a strange thought or two, but believe me, these are normal thoughts for a guy . . .
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Well, maybe not that last one . . .
>>>  The woman grabs the tablecloth and looks shocked. 
1993-05-18 * 
Dilbert sits at a table in a restaurant with a two-headed woman.  The woman says, <<<
Our last blind date was intimidated just because we're two-headed and telepathic.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Must clear my mind.  Don't think of anything naughty.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Oops.
>>>  The woman spills her drink. 
1993-05-17 * 
Dilbert holds a bouquet of flowers and rings a doorbell.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
If I have enough blind dates, eventually the odds will be in my favor.
>>> A pair of conjoined twins answers the door and says, <<<
Hi, I'm Debbie and I'm Donna.
>>> Dilbert sits on the couch thinking, <<<
I think this actually improves my odds.
>>>  The siamese twins say, <<<
We're telepathic.
>>> 
1993-05-16 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert walk through the park.  Dilbert says, <<<
I gave five hundred dollars to charity this year.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I believe it's my moral duty to help those less fortunate.
>>> Dilbert lifts Dogbert onto a rock.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Five hundred dollars?  What kind of morality is that?
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
People are starving and you still have plenty of money left for your hobbies.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
According to YOUR moral code it's more important for you to have a new computer than for poor people to eat.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Morality?  Ha!  You spent five hundred bucks to ease your own guilt!
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
And it worked.  I feel pretty good.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How much did YOU give to charity?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
A thousand.  That's why I'm so torqued.
>>> 
1993-05-15 * 
Dogbert sits on a park bench with a large man.  The man says, <<<
I never learned to read, but it didn't matter because I was a great athlete.
>>> The man continues, <<<
Then came the multi-million dollar contract, which I spent on drugs.  Eventually I was banned from sports.  I quit drugs because I couldn't afford it.
>>> The man says, <<<
Now I'm a motivational speaker.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Have you motivated anybody to become illiterate yet?
>>> 
1993-05-14 * 
Dogbert sits on his pillow.  Ratbert asks, <<<
How can I be sure I'm a rat?
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
What if I'm really something else - like a potato - and I just think I'm a rat?
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
I think, therefore I'm a yam.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
It would explain a lot.
>>> 
1993-05-13 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  A man says, <<<
Hey, 'Dil-Butt,' I hear they got you doing budget work now.
>>> The man says, <<<
Ha ha!  It must be really exciting work.  I mean, gosh, making all those numbers add up.
>>> The man walks away saying, <<<
Ha ha!  I'm glad I have a REAL job!
>>>  Dilbert clicks the mouse and thinks, <<<
Not anymore.
>>> 
1993-05-12 * 
Dilbert thinks, <<<
The other engineers shun me because I'm assigned to work on the budget.
>>>  Wally covers his eyes as he walks by Dilbert and thinks, <<<
Shun.
>>> Dilbert walks down the hall thinking, <<<
They know I could pounce any moment and asks inane hypothetical budget questions.
>>>  A man covers his eyes and thinks, <<<
Shun.
>>> Dilbert asks a woman, <<<
What if you only had half as much electricity next year?
>>>  The woman covers her eyes and says, <<<
Too late.  I shunned you.
>>> 
1993-05-11 * 
Susan says to Dilbert, <<<
You'll have to learn our budget system.
>>> Susan explains, <<<
It was developed 400 years ago by a crazed monk who sealed himself in a wine cask.
>>> Susan says, <<<
Unfortunately, we still have him.
>>>  A voice from inside a wine cask says, <<<
Hey, I've got another idea.
>>> 
1993-05-10 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, I want you to help Susan put the department budget together.
>>>  Dilbert's tie stands up and he says, <<<
Budget?!
>>> Dilbert begs, <<<
No, please!  I'll be branded for life.  The other engineers will spit on me.
>>> The Boss thinks, <<<
Darn, his guard is up.
>>>  Dilbert covers his eyes and says, <<<
I'll have to wear a raincoat to work!
>>> 
1993-05-09 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  The Boss asks Dilbert, <<<
Did you know that twenty percent of all microfleems are subradiante?
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Uh-oh.  The Boss has latched onto some obscure engineering fact.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
This is going to be painful.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Just think of the implications.  It means eighty percent of microfleems are NOT subradiante.
>>> Dilbert crawls under his desk thinking, <<<
Maybe I can hide under the desk until this blows over.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Don't you think it's fascinating?  I mean, what with the implications and all . . .
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Okay, okay.  I acknowledge your incredible grasp of technology issues.
>>> The Boss walks away thinking, <<<
It almost makes me curious what a microfleem is.
>>> 
1993-05-08 * 
Dilbert stands in line at a cash register thinking, <<<
It was another hideous shopping experience, but I found exactly the pants I want.
>>>  The clerk says to the man in front of Dilbert, <<<
I'm sorry . . .
>>> The salesclerk says, <<<
This card was reported stolen.  The real owner was strangled with his own pants just minutes ago on aisle six . . .
>>> Dilbert looks at the pants he is holding and thinks, <<<
That would explain why these were on the floor by the chalk outline.
>>> 
1993-05-07 * 
Dilbert asks a salesclerk in a clothing store, <<<
Excuse me, do you have any pants that AREN'T a twelve-inch waist and fifty inches long?
>>> Dilbert holds up a pair of tiny pants and says, <<<
I ask because there are no human beings who could wear these pants, and one of the secrets of retail success is to stock merchandise that somebody might want.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Then people would shop here and actually BUY things.
>>>  The clerk replies, <<<
Wow, that's way harder than what we do.
>>> 
1993-05-06 * 
Dilbert asks a salesclerk in a clothing store, <<<
Can you help me?
>>>  The woman replies, <<<
No, I'm afraid I can't.
>>> The clerk explains, <<<
You see, I get paid the same low hourly wage whether you buy that shirt or not.  And after years in this business I've learned to despise the general public.
>>> Dilbert waves some money at the woman and says, <<<
Please . . . I have exact change.
>>>  The clerk replies, <<<
I have no way of knowing if that's true.
>>> 
1993-05-05 * 
Dilbert says to a salesclerk in a clothing store, <<<
Some people might be fooled by your pretending to be a store mannequin.
>>>  The man stares straight ahead and stands still. Dilbert continues, <<<
But I saw you hide your name tag.  I know you're a retail clerk who is trying to avoid helping me.
>>> Dilbert yells, <<<
Hey!  You're moving toward the 'employees only' door.  Stop it!  You won't get away with this!!
>>>  The clerk thinks, <<<
Ten more feet.
>>> 
1993-05-04 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally, Alice and Ted sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
. . . Companies must learn to embrace change.
>>>  The employees all think, <<<
Uh-oh.  It's another management fad.
>>> They all think, <<<
Will it pass quickly or will it linger like the stench of a dead woodchuck under the porch?
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I think we should do a 'change' newsletter.
>>>  The employees think, <<<
Woodchuck.
>>> 
1993-05-03 * 
Dilbert thinks, <<<
I prepare to enter the sensory deprivation chamber.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I will experience no mental or physical stimulation for hours.
>>> Dilbert sits in his cubicle thinking, <<<
All that and I get paid too.
>>> 
1993-05-02 * 
Dilbert sees a sign that says <<<
Bungee Jump 10 dollars.
>>>  He thinks, <<<
It's the manly thing to do.
>>> Dilbert enters the office and says, <<<
I'd like to expose myself to avoidable danger.
>>>  A man says, <<<
Sit right down.
>>> The man says, <<<
I need to know your weight so I can adjust the bungee cord.
>>> The man says, <<<
Be sure you don't under-estimate your weight or else your head will hit the ground like an over-ripe cantaloupe.
>>> Dilbert answers, <<<
Seven hundred pounds.
>>> The man wraps a bungee cord around Dilbert's body and head.  He says, <<<
Count to three and jump.
>>> Dilbert and the man stand on a hill.  Dilbert says, <<<
I didn't know you could do this on a hill.
>>>  The man kicks Dilbert. Dilbert lies face-down on the hill.  He says, <<<
Today, I am a man.
>>>  The man says, <<<
For a hundred bucks I'll pull you back.
>>> 
1993-05-01 * 
Dilbert says to a woman, <<<
. . . Then I said 'what about an optical disk file server.'"  The woman thinks as she spills her coffee and starts to fall, <<<
So boring, falling asleep . . .
>>> Dilbert watches as the woman falls over backwards. Dilbert says to a police officer, <<<
I don't know how she died.  i was telling her about an optical . . .
>>>  The policeman falls asleep and begins to fall. 
1993-04-30 * 
The caption says, <<<
Dogbert's good news show.
>>>  Dogbert sits at a news desk and says, <<<
Nine out of ten people have jobs . . . Three billion people had a nice day today . . . And the forest has plenty of owls.
>>> The caption says, <<<
Regular news show.
>>>  A news anchor says, <<<
A huge asteroid could destroy earth!  And by coincidence, that's the subject of tonight's miniseries.
>>>  The other reporter yells, <<<
We'll all die!!
>>> The caption says, <<<
Back to Dogbert . . .
>>>  Dogbert holds a remote control and says, <<<
In science, researchers proved that this simple device can keep idiots off of your television screen.
>>> 
1993-04-29 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm going to start up a television news network that only reports happy stories.
>>> Dogbert sits at a news desk and says, <<<
In sports, fifty percent of the teams won their games yesterday and all the players are millionaires - most of whom have no serious drug problems.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Our person of the week is Darryl, who, despite his tiny brain, found success through a life of crime.
>>>  In the corner of the tv screen there is a picture of a man holding a bag of money and hugging a woman in front of a palm tree. 
1993-04-28 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair watching television and Dogbert sits on the hassock.  The newscaster says, <<<
After that tragic story we have an even more tragic update on a previously reported tragedy, then . . .
>>> The news reporter continues, <<<
We'll tell you about people who got killed by the weather.  And in sports we profile the injury of the week.
>>> The newscaster continues, <<<
And in local news, not much was happening, so we drove the news van around until we hit a pedestrian.
>>> 
1993-04-27 * 
Dilbert shows the Boss new computer hardware and tells him, <<<
For only twenty-five thousand dollars I've eliminated many tedious and time-consuming processes.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
What would be an example of one of those tedious and time-consuming processes?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Well, there was the process of sitting around and wishing I had more computer stuff . . .
>>>  The Boss thinks, <<<
Next time don't ask.
>>> 
1993-04-26 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk thinking, <<<
I need to work on something big so I can justify my existence here.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
But not something important, because that would draw attention to me at a time of staff cuts.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
What can I do that costs a lot but nobody wants?
>>>  The Boss walks by thinking, <<<
'Empowerment' sure made them quiet.
>>> 
1993-04-25 * 
Dilbert stands across from the Boss's desk and says, <<<
Government statistics show that office productivity went DOWN as computers became widely used.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But I didn't believe it.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
So I wrote a little software program to test that conclusion.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
It only tood a month, but it produced some impressive data.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
In fact, it was so impressive it took a week to figure out how to print it.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But before I could print, my computer crashed and I didn't have backup copies.
>>> Dilbert concludes, <<<
So, it seems the government was right; computers are to blame for the decline in productivity.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Do you think the employees could be partly responsible?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Sure, find a scapegoat.
>>> 
1993-04-24 * 
Dogbert sits in the chair.  Dilbert says, <<<
Look what I got for my computer!  It's a romostatic real-time data compression processor!
>>> Dilbert walks away saying, <<<
Oooh . . . I can't wait to plug you in, my little darling.  I've waited so long.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Oh yes!  Yes!
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Does the church know about this?
>>> 
1993-04-23 * 
Dilbert says to a classroom of children, <<<
The goal of every engineer is to retire without getting blamed for a major catastrophe.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Engineers prefer to work as 'consultants' on project teams.  That way there's no real work, blame is spread across the group, and you can crush any idea from marketing!
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
. . . And sometimes you get free donuts just for showing up!
>>>  The teacher says, <<<
Get out of my classroom.
>>> 
1993-04-22 * 
Dilbert stands in front of a classroom of children saying, <<<
And don't forget the social life that comes with being an engineer.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Ninety percent of all engineers are guys, so it's a bonanza of dating opportunities for the ladies who enter the field.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
For the men, there are these little video game devices . . .
>>>  A little girl raises her hand and asks, <<<
Would I be allowed to date a non-engineer?
>>> 
1993-04-21 * 
Dilbert says to a classroom of young students, <<<
Engineering is one of the best careers available.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
For the next twenty years I'll sit in a big box called a cubicle.  It's like a restroom stall but with lower walls.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I spend most of my time hoping the electromagnetic fields from my office equipment aren't killing me.
>>>  The children look horrified. 
1993-04-20 * 
A school teacher says to a classroom of children, <<<
Dilbert has agreed to talk to the class about exciting careers in the field of engineering!
>>> Dilbert says to the students, <<<
There's more to being an engineer than just writing technical memos that nobody reads.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Once in a while, somebody reads one.  Then you have to find a scapegoat, or use some vacation time and hope it all blows over.
>>> 
1993-04-19 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  The Boss says, <<<
The local school wants somebody to talk to the kids about a career as an engineer.
>>> The Boss giggles as he says, <<<
I'm giving this plum assignment to you because you're such a good role model.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's more sincere sounding when you don't giggle.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Remember, children are our future!
>>> 
1993-04-18 * 
Dilbert and a woman sit at a table in a restaurant.  The woman says, <<<
Thanks for asking me to dinner, Dilbert.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
It's my pleas . . .
>>> The woman interrupts, <<<
I love eating out.  What kind of tablecloth is this?  I saw a movie last month.
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Uh-oh . . . She's a serial yakker.
>>> The woman says, <<<
Yak yak yak blah blah yak blah yak.
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
She changes topics without even pausing to breathe.
>>> While the woman rambles, Dilbert thinks, <<<
It's too hard to listen.  I'm slipping into a coma.
>>> Dilbert grabs the tablecloth as he falls over in his chair. The waiter asks, <<<
Is there a problem?
>>>  Dilbert lies on the floor.  He says, <<<
Run!  Save yourself!
>>> The woman starts talking again.  The waiter panics and thinks, <<<
Serial yakker!
>>> The waiter falls on top of Dilbert and says, <<<
Help me.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Shhh!  I'm trying to play dead.
>>> 
1993-04-17 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dilbert says, <<<
. . . And people who don't bother to vote have no right to complain.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Why not?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Why not?  It's obvious.  No vote means no right to complain.  You can't get much more logical than that.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Besides, that's how I was raised.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
You were raised by bumper stickers?
>>> 
1993-04-16 * 
A tall woman has her arm around Wally.  Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
Life has been great since the testosterone started spewing from my head.
>>> Dilbert points to the drops on Wally's head and says, <<<
It looks like the flow is stopping.
>>> The woman steps away from Wally and says, <<<
Wait-a-minute.  Why was I touching you?
>>>  Wally says, <<<
I hope you won't be shallow about this.
>>> 
1993-04-15 * 
Wally shows Dilbert a pickup truck and says, <<<
Maybe it's because of my high testosterone levels, but I couldn't resist getting my pickup jacked up.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I thought it would be more frightening to the people I tailgate.
>>> As he jumps into the truck and wiggles his legs, Wally says, <<<
The only problem is that you can't let people see you trying to get in it.
>>> 
1993-04-14 * 
Dilbert says to Wally, who has his arm around a woman, <<<
Gee, Wally, you sure have been popular with women since the testosterone started spewing from your head.
>>>  Drops of liquid come from Wally's head. Wally replies, <<<
It's amazing . . . I even bought a pickup truck and a rifle so I can hunt after work.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What do you hunt around here?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
Pigeons are the most convenient . . . Don't even have to get out of the truck.
>>> 
1993-04-13 * 
Drops of liquid fly from Wally's head.  Wally thinks, <<<
Being bald isn't so bad.  With all this testosterone, men will fear me and women will desire me.
>>> Wally approaches a man and woman and says to the man, <<<
Take a hike, fuzzy.  She's mine now.
>>> The woman says, <<<
I do find you strangely attractive.
>>>  Wally points to the drops on his head and says, <<<
Testosterone, you're helpless.
>>> 
1993-04-12 * 
Wally says to Dilbert and Ted, <<<
Don't get too close - I found out that my baldness is caused by too much testosterone.
>>> Wally continues, <<<
Now with my hair gone I'm afraid the testosterone will start flinging out of my pores.
>>> Drops of testosterone fly out of Wally's head.  Ted says, <<<
Hey!  You got some on my shirt!
>>>  Wally raises his fists and says, <<<
Do you have a problem with that?
>>> 
1993-04-11 * 
Dogbert's journal entry says, <<<
A small band of the creatures were known to live high in an artificial structure.
>>>  The panel shows an office building. Dogbert's journal says, <<<
On my way to study them I took note of the native vegetation.
>>>  Dogbert stands in an office wearing a backpack.  He feels a potted plant and thinks, <<<
Rented.
>>> His journal says, <<<
The younger males were at play.  They became self-conscious when watched.
>>>  Dogbert watches a man playing computer games. Dogbert's journal says, <<<
The dominant male had a gray back.  He controlled the others by waving little envelopes.
>>>  The Boss waves paychecks at the employees and they bow to him. Dogbert's journal says, <<<
There were few females in the group.  The less dominant males had no chance of mating.
>>>  Dilbert and Wally watch a woman walk past them. Dogbert's journal syas, <<<
Unlike other species they head no instinct for grooming.
>>>  A man asks, <<<
Want to groom?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
Drop dead.
>>> The journal says, <<<
My time was up, but I will miss them, those . . .
>>>  Dogbert walks toward the elevator. The journal concludes, <<<
Engineers in the mist.
>>>  Wally asks Dilbert, <<<
How long are you supposed to microwave popcorn?
>>> 
1993-04-10 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair reading a book and Dogbert sits on the hassock.  Dilbert says, <<<
. . . As you approached the speed of light you would become infinitely dense.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Then would you be forced to take a job as a high school gym teacher?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
The book changes subjects at this point.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Sounds like a cover-up.
>>> 
1993-04-09 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the dresser mirror tying his tie and Dogbert sits on the bed.  Dilbert says, <<<
I have to give a speech to the 'Society of Engineers' today . . . I'm a bit nervous.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Sometimes you can relax by imagining the audience is naked.
>>> Dogbert's ears stand straight up and he says, <<<
Whoa!  Cancel that.  I just pictured four hundred naked engineers.
>>>  Dilbert's tie crumples and he says, <<<
Too late.
>>> 
1993-04-08 * 
Dilbert sits on the couch reading a book and Ratbert sits on the armrest.  Ratbert says, <<<
If I don't get some love and support around here, I might turn to a life of heinous crime . . .
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
Or worse, I could become a certified public accountant . . .
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Stop it.  You're scaring me . . .
>>>  Ratbert says, <<<
I'm good with numbers.
>>> 
1993-04-07 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair reading the newspaper and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs reading a book.  Ratbert, who is sitting on the hassock, says, <<<
I was wondering if we're a dysfunctional family.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
You're not a family member.  You're a rat who won't go away.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
Suddenly I have the urge to rob a convenience store.
>>> 
1993-04-06 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Ratbert says, <<<
Dogbert says that 'absence makes the heart grow fonder.'
>>> Ratbert says as he climbs into the trash, <<<
I'm going to hide in your waste basket until my absence makes you fond of me.
>>> Dilbert leaves the room.  Ratbert says from inside the waste basket, <<<
It's a subtle change at first . . . Take your time.
>>> 
1993-04-05 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Ratbert asks, <<<
Is it possible that you're prejudiced against rats because you once had a bad experience with a rat?
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Just out of curiosity, what would be a GOOD experience with a rat?
>>> Ratbert puts his hands on his hips and says, <<<
I believe I've been insulted!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
That was kind of a good experience.
>>> 
1993-04-04 * 
Dilbert walks into a computer store called the <<<
Electron Hut.
>>> Dilbert tells the salesman, <<<
I'm looking for a p-connect adapter post.
>>> The clerk replies, <<<
We don't have any.
>>> Dilbert points to the wall and says, <<<
There's a whole shelf of them right behind you.
>>> The salesclerk replies, <<<
They're only five cents apiece.  I can't waste my time selling them.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm the only customer in the store!  Besides, why do you stock something you don't want to sell?
>>> The clerk throws the posts at Dilbert's head and says, <<<
Here!  Take three!  And stop wasting my time!
>>> Dilbert kneels on the floor and picks up the posts.  The salesman asks, <<<
While you're here, have you seen our fine line of computers?
>>> 
1993-04-03 * 
Dogbert stands on a desk chair and says into a video camera, <<<
This is Dogbert, Master of Earth, with a message to all creatures . . .
>>>  There is a satellite dish on the desk. A man and woman sit on their couch holding Dogbert signs and watching television.  Dogbert says on tv, <<<
I realized that you are all unworthy of having me as your king.  I am retiring to go sit on a soft pillow.
>>> Dogbert lies on his pillow listening to the radio.  Dogbert thinks, <<<
No matter what I do, it always feels better when I stop doing it.
>>> 
1993-04-02 * 
Wally and Dilbert hold Dogbert signs and are wearing brassieres.  Wally says, <<<
You have to admit it - since Dogbert conquered the earth we've had no wars and the economy improved.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
It could be a coincidence.  All he's ordered so far is that we carry his picture and wear brassieres.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I think you're afraid of change.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Oh yeah?  Well, I don't think you're a 'D' cup.
>>> 
1993-04-01 * 
Dogbert stands on the desk chair in front of a video camera.  Dilbert asks Dogbert, <<<
May I have a word with you?
>>>  Dilbert is holding a Dogbert sign. Dilbert says, <<<
I understand that you hijacked a satellite signal and hypnotized everybody to carry your picture and chant your name.  That is not amusing.
>>> Later, Dilbert says to Ratbert, <<<
In retrospect, I shouldn't have said 'that is not amusing.'"  They are both wearing brassieres. 
1993-03-31 * 
Dogbert stands on the desk chair and says into a camera, <<<
This is Dogbert . . . You are all under my hypnotic powers . . .
>>>  A satellite dish sits on the desk. Dogbert transmits to a satellite orbiting earth, <<<
I am the supreme ruler of earth.  You must all carry Dogbert posters and chant 'Dogbert is my king.'
>>> Dogbert concludes, <<<
That is all for now.  If I think of anything else important I'll let you know.
>>>  Ratbert enters holding a sign with Dogbert's picture on it and chanting, <<<
. . . Is my king.
>>> 
1993-03-30 * 
Dogbert says to Bob the Dinosaur, <<<
Bob, I need your help in my quest to conquer earth.
>>>  Bob asks, <<<
What do I do?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I'll use my powers of hypnosis to control everybody who sees me on television.  You must whack everybody else with your mighty tail.
>>> Bob strokes his tail and asks, <<<
Did I ever mention that I have sensitive skin?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Start with accountants.  They're soft and you can build calluses.
>>> 
1993-03-29 * 
Dogbert says to a store clerk, <<<
I'm looking for a device that will allow me to take over the satellites of all the major broadcasters.
>>> The salesclerk winks as he says, <<<
It would be illegal to sell something like that.  But maybe you'd be interested in an electronic fishing lure instead.
>>> The salesman continues winking as he says, <<<
Fish can't resist the 'Hijack 3000' lure.  And it comes with its own stupid-looking hat!
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Clever.
>>> 
1993-03-28 * 
Dilbert asks the Boss, <<<
Do you have a minute?
>>>  The Boss sits at his desk and thinks, <<<
Uh-oh, it's touchy-feely stuff.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What's going to happen to our department?  The rumors are flying.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
What have you heard?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Rumor has it that flying lizards from the planet Zorb will buy the company.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
They plan to turn the employees into giant corn dogs on sticks.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
Don't worry about rumors.  It's business as usual for now.
>>> Dilbert gulps and walks away.  The Boss thinks, <<<
I think I handled that pretty well.
>>> Dilbert and Wally have long sticks on their backs.  Dilbert asks, <<<
Are you sure this will impress the Zorbians?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
I hear they like team players.
>>> 
1993-03-27 * 
Dogbert sits on his pillow reading a book titled <<<
Hypnosis For World Conquest.
>>>  Dogbert thinks, <<<
Looks easy enough.
>>> Ratbert enters and says, <<<
Hi, Dogbert!  What are you reading?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Nothing.  You will remember nothing.
>>> Ratbert holds his arms out like a zombie and asks, <<<
Who am I?  Where am I?
>>>  Dogbert thinks, <<<
That was a little bit like sandblasting a soup cracker.
>>> 
1993-03-26 * 
The Boss hands Dilbert a form and says, <<<
All employees must fill out this form.
>>> Dilbert reads, <<<
Employee election to not rescind the opposite action of declining the reverse inclination to not discontinue employment with the company.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
You're trying to trick us into quitting, aren't you?
>>>  The Boss hands Dilbert a pen and says, <<<
Use ink.
>>> 
1993-03-25 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk and says, <<<
I'll prove I deserve to be promoted to 'Technical Prima Donna.'
>>> Dilbert sprays the Boss with a fire extinguisher and says, <<<
I think this shows that I'm emotionally unstable and potentially dangerous.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How was that?
>>>  The Boss says from under a pile of foam, <<<
It was good.  I'm starting to over-value your technical knowledge already.
>>> 
1993-03-24 * 
Dilbert sits in a desk chair and Dogbert stands on the desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
Your boss won't promote you to 'Technical Prima Donna' until you learn disdain for others.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Pretend this inflatable dummy is a co-worker asking a question.  See how long you can ignore it.  I'll check back later.
>>> Dilbert whispers to the dummy, <<<
Psst. Nothing personal, buddy.  This is just practice.
>>>  Dogbert yells, <<<
Hey!  Hey!
>>> 
1993-03-23 * 
Dilbert sits on the floor hugging his knees and Dogbert sits on the couch armrest.  Dilbert says, <<<
I have a chance to be promoted to 'Technology Prima Donna' if I can develop a personality disorder.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I don't know how a person can learn that sort of thing.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
It's easy.
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
Imagine Dustin Hoffman in 'Rain Man.'  Now add a dash of Sean Penn meeting a paparazzo.
>>>  Dilbert clenches his fists and says, <<<
Grrr . . . . Mumble . . . Grrr . . . 
>>> 
1993-03-22 * 
Dilbert sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
Your engineering knowledge is good, but I can't promote you to 'prima donna.'
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
. . . Unless you demonstrate a few more serious personality disorders.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
I can mumble.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Sure, but can you do it with disdain for all of humanity?
>>> 
1993-03-21 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Have you ever noticed how crabby people always get what they want?
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
It defies all reason.  Society should punish the crabby, but instead they get rewarded.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
So why fight it?  I've decided to try the power of crabdom myself.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm working.  Could we talk later?
>>> Dogbert says angrily, <<<
Later?!  Later?!  Is my time worthless to you?  What about MY needs?
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
We'll talk NOW or we won't talk ever again!!
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Okay, okay!  Let's talk.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Or were you just testing the power of crabdom?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Now you will dance for me.
>>> 
1993-03-20 * 
Dilbert stands at the checkout counter.  The clerk at the cash register says, <<<
That's $1.89.
>>> Dilbert hands him money and says, <<<
Just for simplicity, I'll give you $7.14.
>>> Dilbert turns toward the reader and says, <<<
As an engineer, I feel a professional reponsibility to make things easy for people.
>>>  The cashier looks confused as he thinks, <<<
. . . Carry the three.
>>> 
1993-03-19 * 
Ratbert stands on the table holding his arms out.  Ratbert asks Bob the Dinosaur, <<<
Dilbert says it's impossible to fly by flapping your arms.  Is he right, Bob?
>>> Bob replies, <<<
It just depends how hard you flap.
>>> Dilbert sits in his chair reading the newspaper.  Ratbert flies over him and says, <<<
It must be embarrassing to be you.
>>> 
1993-03-18 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk and Ratbert sits on the desk holding his arms out.  Dilbert says, <<<
Evolution takes millions of years, Ratbert.  You'll be long gone before rats develop flying skills.
>>> Ratbert replies, <<<
That's what they said to the Wright brothers.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But THEY built an airplane.
>>>  Ratbert flaps his arms and asks, <<<
Don't you think they tried this first?
>>> 
1993-03-17 * 
Ratbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I think I'm evolving into a flying rat.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
I noticed that my arms are flatter than my parents' arms.  In a million years this natural advantage will become wings!
>>> Dogbert says as Ratbert walks away, <<<
There goes the happiest rat I know.
>>>  Ratbert flaps his arms and thinks, <<<
Too soon.
>>> 
1993-03-16 * 
A woman stands in front of the Boss's desk and says, <<<
I summarized the budget impacts on six hundred projects with those three bullet points.
>>> The Boss reads, <<<
- Oxygen is good.  - Competition is bad.  - I like Jello.
>>> The woman asks, <<<
Do you think it's too detailed for the senior executives?
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Take out the 'competition' one.
>>> 
1993-03-15 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  A woman says, <<<
Dilbert, I need you to stop everything and do this emergency budget exercise.
>>> The woman explains, <<<
Estimate the budget impact of replacing all the engineers with decorative plants.
>>> The woman says, <<<
Later, I'll summarize everybody's inputs into a bullet point, like 'oxygen is good.'"  Dilbert asks, <<<
Would these be rented plants?
>>> 
1993-03-14 * 
Dilbert says to a woman at a desk, <<<
Uh . . . Lisa, I was wondering if you'd like to go on a date with me.
>>> Lisa replies, <<<
I can only date you if you survive the 'challenge of fear.'
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What is the 'challenge of fear'?
>>>  Lisa replies, <<<
It's a test of your manliness.
>>> Lisa explains, <<<
First you must stick your head in the drawer as I slam it shut.
>>> Lisa continues, <<<
Then I staple you to the employee bulletin board.
>>> Lisa continues, <<<
Live weasels are stuffed in your pants.
>>>  Dilbert looks nervous. Lisa continues, <<<
Finally, you must fling yourself down the elevator shaft!
>>> Dilbert sticks his head in a drawer and says, <<<
Ready.
>>>  Lisa looks at the reader and says, <<<
The weird thing is that THEY rule the world.
>>> 
1993-03-13 * 
Dilbert and a woman sit at a table.  Dilbert says, <<<
I'm not looking for romance.  No, I just want to be friends.
>>> The woman asks, <<<
That's all?  But why?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Because you have a snout like a porpoise.
>>> Dilbert arrives at home wearing disheveled clothes and bent glasses.  Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
When you use reverse psychology, it's best to leave out unflattering references to other mammals.
>>> 
1993-03-12 * 
A man answers his door and asks, <<<
Yes?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I have a Dogbert Insult-O-Gram from your ex-wife . . .
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You're so ugly, weather satellites won't photograph your town unless it's cloudy.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
The smarter people recognize this as a tipping situation.
>>> 
1993-03-11 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair reading the newspaper and Dogbert stands on the hassock.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm going to start a business as a professional insulter.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
For example, I would say to you, you're so ugly that you have to wear a disguise on garbage pick-up day.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
That was uncalled for.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Well, then no charge.
>>> 
1993-03-10 * 
A clerk in a computer store says to Dilbert, <<<
Laptop computers are outdated.  You want our new fingernail models.
>>>  The laptops on the shelf are on sale for 50 cents. The salesclerk explains, <<<
You glue them permanently to each nail.  They sense where each finger is at all times.  You don't need a keyboard.
>>> The salesman continues, <<<
Of course, some people prefer that their computer not know where their fingers are at all times.
>>>  The computer says to the clerk, <<<
Dave, about last night . . .
>>> 
1993-03-09 * 
Dilbert says to Wally and Ted, <<<
I'm so mad . . . I just bought a new computer and it's already obsolete.
>>> Wally replies, <<<
Don't feel bad.  The other engineers won't look down on you just because you're behind the technology curve.
>>> Ted says, <<<
Yeah, we will.
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
Not right in front of him.
>>> 
1993-03-08 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk working on his computer.  Dogbert says, <<<
I just read that a new computer chip is on the market.  Your machine is out of date.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
You're behind the curve.  Technology is racing ahead without you.  You're no longer state-of-the-art or leading edge.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Sometimes people like you can get jobs in museums.
>>>  Dilbert yells, <<<
I bought this thing yesterday!!
>>> 
1993-03-07 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and Alice sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I see some new faces.  Let's go around the table and introduce ourselves.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I hate this.  I'm always afraid I'll forget my name when the pressure is on me.
>>> The man next to Dilbert says, <<<
. . . And I've been in the Integrated Design District for four years.
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
People are saying where they work.  I can't remember the name of my district.
>>> The man concludes, <<<
. . . And there you have it!  Ha ha!
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Aaagh!  Now they're adding witty comments.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I'm drawing a blank.  My only chance is to pretend I only speak Norwegian.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Norna borna corna dorna fiord cajorda.  Ha ha ha!
>>> Back at home, Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
The amazing thing is that I get paid the same no matter what I do.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Thank God for that.
>>> 
1993-03-06 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair reading <<<
I Spy" and Dogbert sits on the hassock reading a book.  Dilbert says, <<<
I don't understand why photographers try so hard to get embarrassing pictures of celebrities.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Heck, I could just scan the celebrity photos into my computer and create any embarrassing situation you can think of.
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the computer.  Dogbert says, <<<
I think Cindy Crawford should look more repulsed.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
This is before we kiss.
>>> 
1993-03-05 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Gee, Linda, if you don't mind some constructive criticism, that dress makes you look pudgy.
>>> Linda screams, <<<
Haaiii!!!
>>> Dilbert arrives at home with his arm in a sling and his clothes tattered.  Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
I still don't understand women, but I think when they yell 'haaiii' it means they like the dress they're wearing.
>>> 
1993-03-04 * 
Linda says to Dilbert, Wally and Ted, <<<
Look everyone, I'm engaged!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Hey, it's one of those 'near diamond' rings they were selling on the tv shopping channel for $29.95.
>>>  Linda looks angry. Dilbert says, <<<
Uh . . . Of course it has a list price of over a hundred dollars . . .
>>>  As Linda walks away Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
Ooh, good save.
>>> 
1993-03-03 * 
Dilbert, Wally, Ted and the Boss sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I've been saying for years that 'employees are our most valuable asset.'
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It turns out that I was wrong.  Money is our most valuable asset.  Employees are ninth.
>>> Wally says, <<<
I'm afraid to ask what came in eighth.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
Carbon paper.
>>> 
1993-03-02 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, Wally and Alice, <<<
From now on, your raises will be partly dependent on an evaluation by your co-workers.
>>> Wally asks, <<<
Hypothetically, if my co-workers got small raises then wouldn't there be more available in the budget for me?
>>> Wally, Alice and Dilbert fall to the ground and fight.  The Boss says, <<<
That didn't last long, even by our standards.
>>> 
1993-03-01 * 
A man says to Dilbert and Wally, <<<
Hi, I'm Tim Zumph, writer of the famous memo of February third, 1978 . . .
>>> Tim continues, <<<
I remember it so clearly.  My boss walked right up and said 'Nice memo, Tim.'  And it wasn't even time for my annual performance review.
>>> Tim shows them a document and says, <<<
I still keep a copy with me.
>>>  Wally points at the memo and says, <<<
Typo . . .
>>> 
1993-02-28 * 
Dilbert sits in a meeting.  The speaker says, <<<
Let's take a ten-minute break.
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I've got to use the restroom and get back before all the mingle groups have solidified.
>>> Dilbert stands in the bathroom and thinks, <<<
Uh no, it's an air dryer, an unexpected delay!
>>> Dilbert returns to the room and thinks, <<<
I'm too late.  All the minglers have formed impenetrable groups.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I'll pretend to study the agenda so it looks like I have a reason to be alone.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Everybody knows it doesn't take this long to read an agenda.  Now what do I do??
>>> Beads of sweat fly off Dilbert's forehead and he tugs on his tie.  He thinks, <<<
I've got to stand here alone, totally non-mingled, for five more minutes.
>>> Dilbert arrives at home looking disheveled.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Tough day at work?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Just the breaks.
>>> 
1993-02-27 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert enters holding a camera and asks, <<<
Would you like to pose for my new calendar, 'The Men of Engineering?'
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
I hope to dispel the myth that engineers are out of shape and unaware of what others are thinking.
>>> Dilbert feels his bicep muscle and says, <<<
I'm still kind of 'pumped' from using the mouse.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Take off your shirt.
>>> 
1993-02-26 * 
The Boss tells Dilbert, <<<
We're having a department bowling night tomorrow.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It's my way of rewarding all of you for your performance this quarter.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
We hate doing things together at night.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
I wasn't happy with your performance.
>>> 
1993-02-25 * 
Dogbert sits on his pillow listening to the radio.  Ratbert says, <<<
I'm writing a book about being trapped in the space hole for three hundred thousand years.
>>> Ratbert writes, <<<
Day one: I thought about cheese.  Day two: see Day one.  Day three;  See day two . . .
>>> Ratbert carries a stack of paper into the room and asks Dogbert, <<<
Do you know a good editor?
>>> 
1993-02-24 * 
Dilbert reaches into a hole and says to Dogbert, <<<
I'm going to pull Ratbert out of the hole in space before anything bad happens.
>>> Ratbert tells Dilbert and Dogbert, <<<
. . . Although only a minute passed in this dimension, I've been floating in the other dimension for three hundred thousand years.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Wow!  It's lucky I didn't reach in there with my watch hand!
>>>  Ratbert yells, <<<
Yes I was bored!!!  Thanks for asking!!
>>> 
1993-02-23 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert look at a hole in midair.  Dilbert yells into the hole, <<<
What's it look like, Ratbert?
>>> Ratbert floats through space and says, <<<
It's beautiful . . . I see the secrets of time revealed . . . An object approaches . . .
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
It's Dick Clark's hair.
>>> 
1993-02-22 * 
Dogbert and Ratbert sit on the hassock watching television.  Dilbert yells from another room, <<<
Dogbert!  Ratbert!  Come quickly, I found a hole in the fabric of space!
>>> Dilbert, Dogbert and Ratbert look at a small hole.  Dilbert says, <<<
We must look inside, but it's too incredibly dangerous.
>>> Dogbert kicks Ratbert into the hole and Dilbert says, <<<
Thanks.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
No problem.
>>> 
1993-02-21 * 
Dogbert sits at a desk in front of a sign that says <<<
Dogbert's Digital Dating Service.
>>> A man enters and says, <<<
I'm a loser.  Sign me up.
>>> Dogbert aims a camera at the man and says, <<<
Say 'Velveeta.'"  The man smiles. Dogbert sits at a computer and says, <<<
Now we digitize your picture for the database.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I could add some digital hair.
>>>  The man replies, <<<
Good idea.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Maybe I should bob your nose and give you a tan.
>>>  The man says, <<<
That's fair.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Whiten teeth?  Smooth wrinkles?  Hide stomach?  Thicken lips?
>>>  The man replies, "Yes" to all of his questions. The man looks at the final photo and says, <<<
I look like Sandra Bernhard.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Yeah, but you have to admit it improves your odds.
>>> 
1993-02-20 * 
Dilbert asks Dogbert, <<<
Do you notice anything different?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
No.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm wearing contact lenses.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Then why are you still wearing glasses?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
They're my emergency backup system.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Your pants are on backwards.
>>> 
1993-02-19 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
Hey, Wally, how did you get a roof for your cubicle?
>>> Wally replies, <<<
This stuff is modular.  You just take some idiot's wall and make it your ceiling.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
By any chance, do you know what happened to MY wall?
>>>  Wally asks, <<<
What did it look like?
>>> 
1993-02-18 * 
The Boss, Dilbert, Alice and Ted sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
I've got good news and bad news.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
The bad news is that huge companies like us can't compete against small, nimble companies.  The good news is that at this rate WE'LL be the smallest company around.
>>> Dilbert, Alice and Ted shout, <<<
We're number one!  Yes!!
>>>  The Boss thinks, <<<
What am I doing wrong here?
>>> 
1993-02-17 * 
An employee says to the Boss, <<<
I found a typo in the budget spreadsheet . . . It's too late to fix it.
>>> The man continues, <<<
We transferred one job to another group but accidentally kept the money and headcount.
>>> The Boss tells another man, <<<
. . . So, we still pay you but you aren't allowed to do work.
>>>  The man thinks, <<<
This is the happiest day of my life.
>>> 
1993-02-16 * 
Ted sits at his desk.  Dilbert asks, <<<
What are you up to, Ted?
>>>  Ted replies, <<<
I'm working like a dog lately.
>>> Dilbert walks away thinking, <<<
I'd better not ask.
>>> Ted scratches his head with his foot. 
1993-02-15 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, Wally and Alice, <<<
In order to build team spirit I've decided you should have lunch together once a week.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I won't be there myself because it would seriously cut into my free time.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Besides, it's my job to motivate, not get bogged down in the details.
>>> 
1993-02-14 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, I want you to interview the job applicant who's coming in today.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
See if he's got what it takes to be an engineer.
>>> Dilbert holds out his hand and says to the candidate, <<<
Hi, Karl.  We'll start with the standard engineering test.
>>>  Karl says, <<<
Okey dokey.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I have thiry-five pens and pencils here.  How many are really needed to perform your job?
>>>  Karl answers, <<<
All of them.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Correct . . . Now, what is the proper way to carry them with you?
>>> Karl puts all of the pens and pencils in his shirt pocket.  Dilbert says, <<<
Right again.  Last question: what is the advantage of wearing natural fabrics?

1993-02-13 * 
Dilbert and a woman sit at a table in a restaurant.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
This is it . . . The critical third date.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
This is when they casually mention any hidden deformities or horrible secrets to see if you still like them.

Some people say you should stop dating after you marry a mob boss.

Dogbert stands across from the Boss's desk.  Dogbert hands the Boss a report and says, <<<
Here's my final report on your company.

I've concluded that you're doomed.  You waste too much money on consultants.
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
You're a consultant.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Ironic, isn't it?
>>> 
1993-02-11 * 
A man stands in front of Dogbert's desk and says, <<<
We don't need any of your 'intuition' mumbo jumbo.  We need quantitative data!
>>> The man continues, <<<
The only way to make decisions is to pull numbers out of the air, call them 'assumptions,' and calculate the net present value.
>>> The man continues, <<<
Of course, you have to use the right discount rate, otherwise it's meaningless.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Go away.

This exercise is especially for the MBAs in the company.

What's the payback?

There's no research to support this method, but you gotta admit it feels right.
>>> 
1993-02-09 * 
Dogbert stands in front of the Boss and several employees.  Dogbert points at a diagram of a man's head being crushed by a vice grip.  Dogbert says, <<<
As your consultant I will unleash the creativity that the company has supressed.

We'll begin with word association.  I'll say a word then you each say what pops into your head.  Chair.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
Donut?
>>>  A man next to the Boss says, <<<
I say donut too.

I was going to say donut.

Dogbert sits across from the Boss's desk and says, <<<
As your consultant I'll be able to unleash right-brain potential in your employees.

They'll learn to find creative answers, not just rely on left-brain quantitative analysis.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Which part of the brain do we use for meetings?

That would be the stem.

Is that a big percentage?  Does it make any difference?

How does that compare to other health risks?  Should I be concerned?

I'm your new senior vice president, and I want you to lick the tar off my Porsche now.

Okay, but watch the quality of my work!

1993-02-03 * 
Dilbert drives the car and Dogbert sits in the passenger seat.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Where are we now?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I can't tell you.  That's part of the experiment.
>>> Dogbert sits on the roof of the car and Dilbert holds a clipboard.  Dilbert says, <<<
I read in 'Reader's Digest' how a dog found his way home from a hundred miles away.  I want to test your homing instinct.
>>> When Dilbert isn't looking, Dogbert drives away in the car.  Dilbert says, <<<
Okay, I think we're ready to begin . . .
>>> 
1993-02-02 * 
Peter says to Dilbert and a woman, <<<
Yesterday I was a computer programmer and today I'm your new supervisor.
>>> Peter tugs at his pants and says, <<<
The hardest part is mastering these dang management clothes.  Did you know they don't come with an instruction manual?
>>> Peter's pants fall to his ankles and he says, <<<
I'll have to call their '800' help line again.
>>> 
1993-02-01 *

Peter, you're a brilliant computer programmer and you like your job.

Before I read your proposal, run it past our legal department.
>>>  Dilbert groans. The Boss thinks, <<<
That's the end of that.
>>> A lawyer tells Dilbert, <<<
I didn't have to become a corporate lawyer.  I could be a trial lawyer or a judge, you know.
>>> The attorney continues, <<<
But I chose to work here at this unglamorous position.
>>> The man continues, <<<
Consequently, I have a bad attitude and I'm going to take it out on you.
>>> The lawyer says, <<<
Your proposal does noting to help MY career.  And if I approve it and we get sued later, then I'll get in trouble.
>>> The lawyer continues, <<<
In a month or so, I'll formally reject your idea with a neatly typed but oddly worded memo.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Did he reject your proposal yet?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Yeah.  And he filed a lawsuit against me.

Dilbert and a woman sit at a table in a restaurant.  The woman says, <<<
I like a man who isn't afraid to cry.

Waah!  Waah!  The prices here are so high!  Waah!  Waah!
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
It's not working.  She tricked me.
>>>  The woman looks at the menu and says, <<<
I'll just have water, I think.
>>> 
1993-01-29 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert walk outdoors.  Dogbert says, <<<
I've decided to be the center of the universe.

All of the things in the universe can now be described in terms of their relationship to me.
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert sit on a rock.  Dilbert says, <<<
I don't understand why you're doing this.

That's because your brain is only a half-Dogbert.

Dilbert, the Boss, Alice and Ted sit at a conference table.  Ted says, <<<
Whoa whoa!  I just got an idea that could change everything . . .

What if we LOWERED expenses and INCREASED revenues?  That could help our financial situation.

Aaagh!  I can't see!!!

Sounds like a blinding flash of the obvious, sir.
>>> 
1993-01-27 * 
Dilbert says to a man, <<<
Hi, Tim.  What are you working on these days?
>>>  Tim replies, <<<
A secret project.

Very, very secret.  Confidential and proprietary.  Real hush-hush.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It sounds important.

Just move along.

1993-01-26 * 
Dilbert tosses a Frisbee and says, <<<
Get it, Dogbert!

Good idea, but they're harder to throw.

Dilbert, Wally, Alice, the Boss and Ted sit at a conference table.  Ted says, <<<
If there are no objections, I'd like to make funny faces and tell a long rambling story.

Blah blah blah" and waves his arms.  The Boss thinks, <<<
I can top that.

Dilbert sits at a conference table with three other people.  A man says, <<<
Maybe Dilbert can tell us if our plan is technically feasible.

For dramatic effect I'll scoff loudly.

Oh no!  Some spittle went down my air pipe . . . I'm choking.

Should we do something?

We're over our headcount, you know.

Blah blah blah.

He reasons that if he can fix your problems he won't have to hear about them anymore.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Blah blah me.

He hopes that the wisdom and compassion he just faked was enough to arouse you.  Now he will talk about himself.

1993-01-22 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert stands on the hassock.  Dogbert says, <<<
Here's my new business card.  I'm a romance interpreter.
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
For a small fee I'll accompany you on dates and translate between male and female language.
>>> Dilbert, Dogbert and a woman sit at a table in a restaurant.  The woman says, <<<
Blah blah blah.
>>>  Dogbert translates, <<<
She's telling a pointless story about work.  By annoying you in this way she hopes to form a closer bond.

Dilbert sits at his desk working on the computer.  The Boss says, <<<
Sometimes I wonder, how would MY life be different if all whales were extinct?
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It's not like they do anything for us.  You never hear of seeing-eye whales.  They can't fetch the paper or drag you out of a burning building . . .
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
Don't you think the world has too many fat, worthless mammals?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I was just thinking that, sir.

The Boss, Dilbert, Wally and a woman sit at a conference table.  The Boss says, <<<
First on the agenda is a discussion of the company's new paper recycling program.

You spotted the one drawback.

1993-01-19 * 
The Boss tells Dilbert and a woman, <<<
To protect our environment, I've ordered that ink be removed from all copiers, printers and pens.

Research shows that many squids can be spared by reducing our ink usage.

I don't think we get our ink from squids, sir.

Oh, right . . . Next you'll say we don't get our 'Elmer's' from cows.

1993-01-18 * 
Dilbert, who is wearing a bathrobe, says to Dogbert, <<<
I'm feeling ill.  I think I'll stay home today.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Great . . . Now you'll try to make me feel sorry for you so I'll wait on you all day.  Well, that's a lousy thing to do to a friend.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Gee, I'm sorry.  Can I get you anything while I'm up?

Tea with lemon.  And some waffles.

Dilbert braces himself against the desk as his arm disappears into the computer.  He shouts, <<<
Help!  Dogbert, I'm being sucked into cyberspace!

Let's hope you don't need pants in cyberspace.

How can I ever describe this to somebody who hasn't been here?

So, you're some kind of nerd, right?

Dilbert sits at his desk.  The Boss enters and says, <<<
My new style of management is exhausting me.

I heard some people talking about 'MBWA' or 'Management by Walking Around.'

I walked all the way to the park and back.  But I can't say that I see much improvement around here.

Ratbert hides behind the chair thinking, <<<
There's Dilbert . . . I'll sneak up and hug his leg until he loves me and accepts me in the family.

Okay, I'm not an expert, but compared to the people who have babies . . .

Which end do I put the cheese steak in?

1993-01-12 * 
A man says to Dilbert, <<<
. . . So, either an IBM 586 with 10 meg RAM or maybe a Sparc CPU on a LAN . . .

. . . But with AI and AVR combined with BISDN, well, it's very G.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
G?

Good.

Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
I'm joining the S.E.W.L.T.U.I.F.E.

To the lay dog, it's known as the 'Society of Engineers Who Like to Use Initials for Everything.'

We use acronyms to set us apart from the unwashed masses who don't understand technology.

Big Furry Deal.

Study the list so you'll know what behaviors are unacceptable.

Wow!  Thanks!  This is a real bonanza!

You're right.  This certainly will improve the quality of my life!

I think I'll do a 'Top Hundred' countdown.  This could amuse me for months.

That didn't go as well as I'd hoped.

Dogbert asks the class, <<<
Can anybody show me what you do with a microwave?

I insert the video tape . . . Then I set the timer for ninety minutes . . .

Does anybody know why it isn't working?

The fool!  It's Beta!

1993-01-08 * 
Dogbert says to a group of people, <<<
Welcome to Dogbert's School for Technology Imbeciles.

Dilbert sees a sign that says, <<<

Why is it free?

Our therapists are first year psychology students.

Sometimes I have low self-esteem . . .

Your problem is that you're ugly.  You should drink beer until you feel handsome.

Dogbert sits on his pillow listening to the radio.  Dilbert says, <<<
It took weeks but I've calculated a new theory about the origin of the universe.

According to my calculations it didn't start with a 'big bang' at all - it was more of a 'phhbwt' sound.

You may be wondering about the practical applications of the 'Little Phhbwt' theory.

I was wondering when you'll go away.

Wally, I notice that all you have is a pager and a calculator watch.

Dogbert looks at a present under the Christmas tree and thinks, <<<
I can't believe he only got ONE gift for me.  This is an outrage.

Good report, but change the word 'use' to 'utilize' in each case.

Change 'help' to 'facilitate' and replace 'do' with 'implementation phase.'

Hmm . . . It's still a bit too readable.

I could reduce the type size and run it through the fax.

I thought you might need help deciding what to get me for Christmas.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I started by doing a complete analysis of your financial situation.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Your utter lack of a social life has resulted in significant cash reserves.

That combined with a second mortgage would make $50,000 available for my gift.

I bought you a hat.

It was on sale.

It seems that every year at about this time I feel like beating somebody senseless with a yule log.

I'm so happy.  I've often thought that the only thing better than a rat in the house is a GIANT rat in the house.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
Yesterday I would have been miffed at your sarcasm.  But that wouldn't be 'big' of me.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Better yet, a giant, WITTY rat.
>>> 
1992-12-18 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Ratbert says, <<<
You've never accepted me in your family because I'm a little rat.

You won't be a rat?

Don't tell me it's the 'rat' part that bothers you . . .

You'll be selling to the small business market.  He's your best account.

Dilbert sits at his desk.  The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, you're being temporarily transferred to the field sales organization.

Normally we use these assignments to round somebody out for management.  But in this case I'm just yanking your chain!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You're over-communicating again, sir.
>>>  The Boss continues, <<<
Plus, I hate the manager of sales.
>>> 
1992-12-13 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert walk in the park.  Dilbert asks, <<<
Have you noticed that people rarely answer questions in conversation?

That reminds me of a story.  One day I . . .
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
See?  There!  You didn't answer my question!
>>> Dilbert asks angrily, <<<
Do you think my questions are meant to be merely rhetorical?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You sure get worked up over the strangest things.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Are you doing this intentionally?!!  Why won't you answer my questions??!!
>>> Dogbert points at the sky and says, <<<
Hey!  There's a cloud that looks like a bunny!

It doesn't get any better than this.

Yeah.  I've already thought of six hundred ways to kill him,

Not you anymore.

Geez, you lefties are thick.  I'm glad I'M normal.

Why you?

You have to be tough with these waiters or else they'll walk all over you.

The lab says they need a few more clumps of your hair . . .

I don't know First Aid.

Dogbert sits on the hassock watching tv.  Dilbert says, <<<
You should read books instead of watching television all the time, Dogbert.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Why?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Books are more educational because they don't have any sound or pictures.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
And books are challenging because it takes hours to read something that television could convey with one image.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
And books make you think because they have more complex plots.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
In fact, you can read entire books without even figuring out what the story was about.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Now compare that with all the junk you're watching.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I just watched the story of how DNA was discovered, then learned to bake a cake from scratch, and now I'm learning the causes of global warming.

What are you reading?

I specialize in the problem cases.  Just sign the application form.
>>> The boy looks at the pencil and says, <<<
Wait . . . I've seen one of these before.  Yes, there's something special about the pointy end . . . But what?
>>>  Dogbert thinks, <<<
Uh oh.
>>> 
1992-11-01 * 
Dilbert points a video camera at Dogbert and says, <<<
Let's see some emotion, Dogbert.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I need to be in the mood.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Remember when it looked like 'E.T.' died, but really he didn't?
>>> Dogbert sniffs like he is about to cry. Dilbert says, <<<
The neighbor's cat says you're fat.
>>>  Dogbert says angrily, <<<
The fool!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Imagine you won an academy award for 'Best Dog.'"  Dogbert looks surprised and says, <<<
Me?!!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Imagine some frozen lavatory waste from a passing jet crashes through the roof and flattens me as I film this.
>>> Dogbert falls over and laughs.  Dilbert asks, <<<
Is that sorrow?  It doesn't look like sorrow.
>>>  Dogbert thinks, <<<
Oops.
>>> 
1992-10-31 * 
Dilbert helps Dogbert onto a rock as he says, <<<
It's amazing that people believe in astrology . . . As if the stars could affect your personality.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Well, seasonal differences in diet, sunlight and natural rhythms could affect expectant mothers, which could have predictable results on fetal brain development.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Maybe the ancients simply used the stars to measure the timing of these patterns.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
If they were so smart, why didn't they invent watches?
>>> 
1992-10-30 * 
Dilbert sits at a table with a bearded man.  The man says, <<<
Let me show you where the information is in your binder.
>>> The man licks his fingers and says, <<<
First, I'll need a good load of saliva on my page-turning hand.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Maybe you can show me in YOUR binder.
>>>  The man replies, <<<
Can't . . . Somehow my pages got all stuck together.
>>> 
1992-10-29 * 
Dogbert stands on a chair across from the Boss's desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm afraid your company is being hit by an El Nino Circadian trough.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Once a decade, the natural body rhythms of all the employees reach their mental low point at the same time.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
It's best to avoid any form of mental activity.
>>>  The Boss yells, <<<
Staff meeting!
>>> 
1992-10-28 * 
Dogbert sits in a chair across from a man.  Dogbert says, <<<
Every person has natural daily rhythms of mental peaks and troughs.  We can use this knowledge to improve your performance.
>>> Dogbert hands the man a thermometer and continues, <<<
We use hourly body temperature readings to identify and avoid the troughs.
>>> As the man leans back in his chair and waves his arms, Dogbert writes, <<<
One o'clock.  We have encountered a severe trough.  I fear it could be the dreaded 'El Nino' trough.
>>> 
1992-10-27 * 
Dogbert stands on a stage holding a microphone.  He addresses the audience, <<<
Welcome to the 'Dogbert Time Management Lecture Series.'
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Sorry I'm an hour late, but I was giving another lecture across town . . . In effect, I'll complete two jobs while you sit in the dark like stunned cattle.
>>> Dogbert looks down at the audience and says, <<<
I don't mean to rub it in, but mooo . . . 
>>> 
1992-10-26 * 
Dogbert sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
So, you're a time management expert huh?  Might be useful . . . I'll let you know . . .
>>> Dogbert screams, <<<
Decide now!  Do it!  Do it, do it!  Now now now now!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
You're good . . . When can you start?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I'll get back to you.
>>> 
1992-10-25 * 
Dilbert and a woman sit on a grassy hill.  The woman says, <<<
Dilbert, I think it would be better if we were just friends.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Okay.
>>> The woman thinks, <<<
Okay??  He took it too easy.  I should bargain for more.
>>> The woman says, <<<
I mean . . . Friends with OTHER people.  You and I would just be acquaintances.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Okay.
>>> The woman thinks, <<<
Still too easy.  I can get more.
>>> The woman says, <<<
I don't mean the kind of acquaintances that could become friends . . . It would be more like you were an ex-employee of mine.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Okay.
>>> The woman says, <<<
Yeah, that's it.  You can be my ex-butler, who I fired for stealing stuff.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Okay.
>>> The woman thinks, <<<
What's going on here?
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Good.  It looks like the window of opportunity is still slightly open.
>>> 
1992-10-24 * 
Dogbert stands on a chair using a computer while Dilbert watches.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'll search my Date-a-Base for women who want a nice guy and don't care about looks.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
All I'm getting are some quotes from guests on 'Donahue,' but they don't seem sincere.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Maybe if I expand the search to include all primates . . .
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Why did you add 'don't care about looks?'
>>> 
1992-10-23 * 
Dogbert sits at a desk under a sign that says, <<<
Dogbert's Dating Service.
>>>  A man says, <<<
I'd like to sign up.
>>> The customer continues, <<<
Although deep down I know that all of the people in your service are men, I cling to the fantasy of meeting the woman who modeled for your brochure.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
She's taken, but I can match you with somebody named 'Francis' or 'Kris.'"  The man replies, <<<
There's hope!
>>> 
1992-10-22 * 
Dogbert, who is holding a stethoscope, says to a room full of people, <<<
Attention, all patients!
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I have turbocharged the x-ray machine and aimed it at the waiting room.  Everybody close your eyes for five minutes then leave.  Your diagnoses will arrive by mail.
>>> Dogbert walks away saying, <<<
It was a stroke of genius to schedule all of the hypochondriacs for the same day.
>>> 
1992-10-21 * 
Dogbert says to a patient on the examining table, <<<
You have a mild flu, and normally you would survive.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
However, in this brief visit I've developed no real empathy for you, so I've decided to let you die.
>>> The man asks, <<<
Is there anything I can do?!
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Well . . . Unless you can afford my new 'Ambassador Class' service.
>>> 
1992-10-20 * 
Dogbert stands on a stool holding a reflex hammer.  He says to the patient on the examining table, <<<
Hold still while Doctor Dogbert whacks your knee.
>>> As Dogbert taps his knee, the man says, <<<
Aak . . . Crime is society's fault . . . Raise taxes to feed the poor . . . Stop nuclear research . . . Save the . . .
>>> The man covers his mouth.  Dogbert says, <<<
Apparently you're a knee-jerk liberal.  You can live a normal life but you'll be annoying at parties.
>>> 
1992-10-19 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on the hassock.  Dogbert says, <<<
I've decided to become a doctor.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
People have to suck up to doctors, otherwise they stick big needles into your body for practically no reason at all.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
A lot of careers don't offer that kind of opportunity.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Yeah, it's not the same with a stapler.
>>> 
1992-10-18 * 
A woman tells Dilbert and Wally, <<<
I'm collecting money for Mary's birthday gift.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How much do you want?
>>>  She replies, <<<
Oh, it's totally up to you.
>>> The woman continues, <<<
However, the usual accepted levels are, in effect . . .
>>> She continues, <<<
Ten dollars from her boss and anybody else who thinks it would improve his odds of becoming romantically involved with her.
>>> The woman continues, <<<
Five dollars from male co-workers who feel their manhood would be threatened by a smaller gift . . .
>>> She continues, <<<
One dollar if you're a secretary or if nobody is watching . . .
>>> The woman concludes, <<<
Or you can just ruffle the money already in the envelope and act like you gave five.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Let's say you fall into more than one of those categories . . .
>>>  Wally ruffles the money in the envelope.  The woman thinks, <<<
Engineers.
>>> 
1992-10-17 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair reading the newspaper and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Remember the time you laughed at your own joke so hard that you inhaled and snorted at the same time?
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Then you choked on your own spit, which caused you to lurch over and bonk your head on the coffee table . . .
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Who says your life is boring?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I'm ignoring you.
>>> 
1992-10-16 * 
Dilbert and a woman sit at a table in a restaurant.  The woman says, <<<
Most handsome men are self-centered jerks.
>>> The woman continues, <<<
But you're different . . . You're . . .
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Considerate?
>>>  The woman replies, <<<
Ugly.
>>> 
1992-10-15 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  The Boss enters and says, <<<
I just received your employee suggestion.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
We'll handle it the usual way -- by making you sit under a wet blanket surrounded by imbeciles.
>>> Dilbert sits in a chair with a blanket covering his head.  Four stupid people stand around him.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
At least there's a process.
>>>  A man asks, <<<
Explain your suggestion again.
>>> 
1992-10-14 * 
The Boss sits at his desk thinking, <<<
Uh-oh . . . I smell a creative idea being formed somewhere in the building.
>>>  The Boss sniffs the air. The Boss sits in a window in the top floor of an office building.  He thinks, <<<
I must find it and crush it.
>>> Dilbert and a man stand in front of a suggestion box while the Boss hides around the corner.  Dilbert says, <<<
Hey, this is new.
>>>  The man says, <<<
It's a trap!!
>>> 
1992-10-13 * 
The caption says, <<<
They say everybody has a perfect romantic match . . .
>>>  Dilbert and Dogbert walk outdoors. The caption says, <<<
And they say the key to a life of happiness . . .
>>>  A woman who looks like Dilbert walks outdoors with her cat. The caption says, <<<
. . . Is to avoid that person at all costs.
>>>  As they pass each other Dilbert, Dogbert, the female Dilbert and her cat all think, <<<
Yuck.
>>> 
1992-10-12 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert walk outdoors.  Dilbert says, <<<
Somewhere out there is the woman who is perfect for me.
>>> They sit down and Dilbert continues, <<<
But how will I recognize her?  How will I know she's the one?
>>> The caption says, <<<
Meanwhile, somewhere 'out there' . . .
>>>  A woman who looks like Dilbert says to her cat, <<<
Okay, I agree that it SEEMS like cats own people, but it's not actually the law.
>>> 
1992-10-11 * 
A man and woman see a sign on a building that says <<<
Parent licenses.
>>> The man says, <<<
We'd better check it out.
>>> Dogbert sits at a desk.  The man asks, <<<
Why do we need a license to become parents?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Something had to be done.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Under the old system, all you needed to be a parent was a few body parts and a brain the size of a garbanzo bean.
>>> Dogbert reaches into the desk drawer and continues, <<<
So I developed this written test to weed out the major bozos.
>>> The woman reads, <<<
If a baby cries, you should: A. Feed it. B. Discipline it. C. Call it 'stupid.'"  The man says, <<<
You have to show it who's the boss.
>>> The woman reads, <<<
If a child gets poor grades you should: A. Tutor him. B. Discipline him. C. Call him 'stupid.'"  The man asks, <<<
What does 'tutor' mean?
>>> The woman reads, <<<
An acceptable nickname for a child is: A. Junior B. Ugly C. Stupid.
>>>  The man says, <<<
Depends if it's a boy.
>>> The man asks Dogbert, <<<
Well?  Can we be parents?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
No.  And you'll have to leave some body parts at the front desk.
>>> 
1992-10-10 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the table.  Dilbert says, <<<
We can only speculate why aliens keep abducting people.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
They often probe people's body cavities.  Sometimes they implant small objects.  It must be some form of highly advanced medical research.
>>> An alien says to another alien, <<<
How about another round of 'Hide the Pellet?'"  The other alien holds up an instrument and replies, <<<
Okay.  I can use my nose prober.
>>> 
1992-10-09 * 
Dogbert and a man in a military uniform sit at the table.  Dogbert says, <<<
General, I don't understand why the government is trying to cover up all the U.F.O. encounters.
>>> The General replies, <<<
People would lose faith in their government if they knew aliens were abducting people and we were helpless to stop them.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
So, to maintain confidence in the government, you use our taxes to kill the citizens who find out?
>>>  The General asks, <<<
Is that so bad?
>>> 
1992-10-08 * 
Dilbert stands next to a man in a military uniform.  Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
The government sent a General to kill me for talking about my encounter with space aliens.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I was scared at first, but when you think about the government's track record, well, my odds are pretty good . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Especially after all the budget cutbacks.
>>>  The General says into a walkie-talkie radio, <<<
Dang it!  Where's my air support?!!
>>> 
1992-10-07 * 
Dilbert opens the door and sees a man in a military uniform.  The general says, <<<
I'm a General from the Department of Government Cover-ups.
>>> The man continues, <<<
If you tell your U.F.O. abduction story to the press we'll slay you with untraceable poison.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I don't think I'm getting a good value for my tax dollar here.
>>>  The General asks, <<<
Breath mint?
>>> 
1992-10-06 * 
Dilbert sits at a table with Dogbert and says, <<<
I didn't remember being abducted by aliens until you hypnotized me.  But now I remember they looked like 'E.T.'
>>> Dilbert looks at a drawing and continues, <<<
I remember being in a dark room with rows of seats.  They fed us a popcorn-like substance.  My feet were stuck to the floor.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I recall being disgusted that they charged me six dollars to enter the ship.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
That's why you suppressed the memory.
>>> 
1992-10-05 * 
Dogbert sits on a chair and Dilbert lies on a couch.  Dogbert says, <<<
You are in a deep sleep . . . Now, while under hypnosis you can draw the aliens who abducted you.
>>> Dogbert whispers, <<<
Hint: they all look exactly like 'E.T.'
>>> No longer hypnotized, Dilbert looks at a drawing and says, <<<
Wow!  I drew that??
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
They usually come back for you.  Better keep a bag packed.
>>> 
1992-10-04 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit under a tree.  Dilbert asks, <<<
Do you think it's better to be smart or good-looking, Dogbert?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I've been both for so long, it's hard to be objective.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's hypothetical.  Suppose you had to pick one.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I'd stay as I am: smart, good-looking and talented.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You can't add stuff.  You have to start with nothing and pick either brains or good looks.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
And witty too . . . Smart, good-looking, talented and witty.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
No, no, no . . . Suppose you had NONE of those qualities.  What would you do then?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I'd probably annoy my dog, same as you.
>>> 
1992-10-03 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert stands on the hassock.  Dogbert holds a pen and a pad of paper.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Have you ever had a strange dream or a nosebleed?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Yes.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
It's clear that you're suppressing memories of being abducted by aliens.  I can use hypnosis to get at those memories.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What if the hypnosis itself makes me think it happened when it didn't?  I'll be scorned and ridiculed for life.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
That's a risk I'm willing to take.
>>> 
1992-10-02 * 
Dilbert and a woman sit at a restaurant table.  The woman says, <<<
I must warn you that I have an obsessive personality.
>>> The woman continues, <<<
If I spend a moment with a man I fall completely in love.  I think of only him.  I . . . I become his slave.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Are you saying . . .
>>>  The woman replies, <<<
Yes.  I'm in love with our waiter.
>>> 
1992-10-01 * 
Ratbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I'm following in your footsteps so I can be a demagogue too.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
Your book 'Unmarried Men are Scum' was so successful that I decided to write my own hate book disguised as science!
>>> Ratbert holds up a manuscript and continues, <<<
I call it 'Moles are Morons.'"  Three moles wearing sunglasses sneak up behind Ratbert.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Were you aware that moles have a strong underground movement?
>>> 
1992-09-30 * 
A television talk show host says into the microphone, <<<
My guest for today's show is Dogbert, author of the one-page book, 'Unmarried Men are Scum.'
>>> The host says to Dogbert, <<<
Your theory is that all unmarried men should be jailed for life, thus ending most crime.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Exactly.
>>> The host asks, <<<
What if they try to beat the system by getting married?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Serves 'em right.
>>> 
1992-09-29 * 
Dogbert stands on a desk chair and types, <<<
Unmarried men commit ninety percent of all violent acts.  They should all be jailed in advance to prevent further atrocities.
>>> Dogbert continues typing, <<<
And I should become a media sensation for suggesting such a provocative thing.  The end.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
It's hard to write a whole book when you're as gifted as I am at getting to the point.
>>> 
1992-09-28 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
I've decided to become a demagogue.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I'll find some issue that appeals to the emotions and blind prejudices of the masses, then I'll whip it into a media frenzy and become a national figure.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
For example, unmarried men are responsible for most of our violent crimes.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
That's because we tend to have pets.
>>> 
1992-09-27 * 
Dogbert sits at a desk under a sign that says, <<<
Detective research on your potential romantic partner.
>>> A woman says, <<<
I'm considering dating a man, but I'm worried.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
What's his name?
>>> The woman answers, <<<
Bill . . . His name is Bill.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Ahh . . . Bill . . . Yes, I know all about Bill.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Bill has a huge ego.  All he thinks about is himself.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
He has no emotional depth and he thinks of your conversations as mere chatter.  He wants your body, not your mind.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Several times a day, Bill imagines himself with different women.
>>>  The woman looks upset. The customer says, <<<
Darn.  This time I thought I'd found a normal guy.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I have some really bad news for you.
>>> 
1992-09-26 * 
Dogbert hands a photograph to a man behind a desk and says, <<<
Here is photo proof that I completed my hit-man contract on Dilbert.
>>>  The man replies, <<<
Excellent.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Here he is, sitting lifeless in his stuffed chair.
>>> The man looks at the picture and says, <<<
It looks like he's just watching television.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Technically, my contract doesn't say I must kill him.  It says I must 'prove he has no life.'
>>> 
1992-09-25 * 
Dogbert sits across from a man behind a desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
I heard you're looking for a hit man to eliminate an inventor named Dilbert.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
For a million dollars I can deliver his head on a platter.
>>> The man asks, <<<
Does it have to be on a platter?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I've tried using those Tupperware lettuce crispers, but it loses a lot of the drama.
>>> 
1992-09-24 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I've received death threats because of my new patent.  So I augmented our home security system.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
The sidewalk is rigged to give an electric shock, thus disarming the intruder.  Then a spring catapults him to the city landfill.
>>>  Outside, someone screams. Dilbert and Dogbert look out the window and see several envelopes falling onto the sidewalk.  Dogbert says, <<<
The mail is here.
>>> 
1992-09-23 * 
A man shows a photograph to a man behind a desk and says, <<<
His name is Dilbert.  He invented something that would make our entire product line obsolete.
>>> The man behind the desk asks, <<<
Do you have a plan?
>>> The employee replies, <<<
Uh . . . I could wax your desk with my hair again.
>>>  The man says, <<<
It's just crazy enough to work.
>>> 
1992-09-22 * 
The garbage man says to Dilbert, <<<
From the looks of your garbage, you've invented some sort of molecule bifurcation communicator.
>>> The garbage man continues, <<<
Ah, yes, Einstein thought this type of thing might work.  Physicist John Stuart Bell kind of fleshed it out in 1964.  But you've really added something . . .
>>> The garbage man points to a scrap of paper and says, <<<
Specifically, you've added this calculation error here.
>>> 
1992-09-21 * 
Dilbert sits at the desk and Dogbert sits next to him.  Dilbert says, <<<
There . . . I think I've invented a way to send vast amounts of data without fiber optic cables.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
It's a simple application of J. S. Bell's theorem.  He showed that if you break up a molecule and change the spin of one electron, the spin of the other electrons originally joined will immediately change too, no matter where they are.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What do you think the fiber optic industry will give me for this.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
A horse's head in your bed.
>>> 
1992-09-20 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  He hears, <<<
Ha ha!  Now spin on your head!  Ha ha ha!
>>> Dilbert walks into the room and sees an Elbonian standing on his head.  He asks Dogbert, <<<
What's going on here?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
This is Yergi.  He's visiting from Elbonia.
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
The economy in Elbonia is so bad he only earns three dollars a month as a doctor.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
It takes a year to earn enough for a pair of shoes . . . It takes TWO years for a pound of meat.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Philanthropist that I am, I offered to give him an old boot if he would act like my trained monkey for a week.
>>> Dilbert scolds, <<<
Dogbert!  I can't believe you would buy this man's dignity for an old boot!
>>> Yergi says, <<<
I plan to tell the kids it's a pound of meat.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Quiet, Bobo.
>>> 
1992-09-19 * 
Dogbert stands on a ladder and addresses a crowd.  Dogbert says, <<<
Vegetarians, we must march to the capitol to protest the killing of animals!
>>> A man in the audience says, <<<
That's a mile away.
>>>  Another man asks, <<<
Can we drive instead?
>>>  A woman asks, <<<
Or maybe write letters?
>>> Back at home, Dilbert sits in his chair reading the newspaper and Dogbert stands on the hassock.  Dogbert says, <<<
Never lead a revolution of people who only own plastic and wooden shoes.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I try to avoid it.
>>> 
1992-09-18 * 
Ratbert and Dogbert walk toward each other on the sidewalk.  Ratbert says, <<<
Hey, Dogbert, everybody is talking about you at the lab.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Really?
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
The 'cow and egg' industry is going to discredit your vegetarian movement.  They paid us to prove meat is healthy.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
What's your role?
>>> Ratbert replies, <<<
I play the rat who ironically chokes to death on a carrot during the news conference.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Great . . . I'll have to see that on CNN about a jillion times.
>>> 
1992-09-17 * 
An overweight man enters Dogbert's office and says as he pants and wheezes, <<<
Are you Dogbert, the new leader of the vegetarian movement?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Yes.
>>> The man continues to pant as he says, <<<
I have a warning from the cow and egg industry . . . You must ERK!
>>> The man lies on the ground with his feet in the air.  Dogbert says, <<<
In retrospect, it was pretty clever of us to rent a third floor command center with no elevator.
>>> 
1992-09-16 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the table.  Dilbert says, <<<
Dogbert, I don't understand why you, or anybody, would become a vegetarian.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
You mean, why don't I take dead animals, cook them until they become carcinogenic, then eat them instead of something nutritious?  Is that your question?
>>> Dilbert answers, <<<
Exactly.  Is there any good reason?  Have you joined a cult?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Apparently.
>>> 
1992-09-15 * 
A thin man with a mustache and glasses says, <<<
Dogbert, we need you to become the charismatic leader of our vegetarian movement.
>>> The man continues, <<<
We tried to pick a leader from our ranks, but most of us are . . . Um . . . Well . . .
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Scrawny wimps?
>>>  The man replies, <<<
Yeah, but deceptively healthy.
>>> 
1992-09-14 * 
A large man behind a desk says to two overweight men, <<<
We must use all of the resources of the 'Cow and Egg' lobby to counter the latest threat from the vegetarians.
>>> The man continues, <<<
Somehow they've managed to link food with health . . . They invented a 'nutrition pyramid' chart and got schools to use it . . .
>>> A teacher points to a chart and says, <<<
Kids, this is a little different from the way I learned it . . .
>>>  Meat, milk and beer are at the top of the pyramid and are labeled <<<
bad.
>>>  The next levels on the pyramid are gravel, bugs; beans, tofu; fruits, vegetables; bread, cereal, grains. 
1992-09-13 * 
Ratbert sits on the hassock eating potato chips.  Dogbert says, <<<
Hi, Ratbert, may I have some chips?
>>> Ratbert answers, <<<
No, sorry.  There are only enough for one.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Did you hear about the latest brain research?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Science has proven that the part of the brain responsible for conscious thought doesn't show any stimulation until AFTER you act.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
That means you never make conscious decisions; all you do is rationalize what you've done after the fact.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Your life is nothing but a series of absurd rationalizations for the random interaction of chemicals in your brain.
>>>  Ratbert starts blinking. Ratbert falls over, drops the bag of chips and screams, <<<
Aaagh!!!  My life is absurd!!
>>> Dogbert sits on the hassock eating the chips.  He says, <<<
That was mean, but aruguably I couldn't control myself.

That's more of a last resort.

He probably hasn't heard me yet.

You would too if you had MY career.

I have a view graph which anticipated your question.

This chart tracks my declining sense of self-worth as my career progresses.

At the low-point, here, I'm reduced to answering imbecilic questions while pointing a little stick at the wall.

How did the presentation go?

There's such a thing as being too prepared.

Dogbert sits at the table and Ratbert stands on the table in front an easel.  Ratbert says, <<<
Tell me what you think, and don't try to spare my feelings.

It's a hideous compost of random colors.  It seems both hackneyed and poorly executed.  It's an embarrassing proof of your utter lack of talent.

As for you personally, spend some time on a 'Stairmaster.'"  Ratbert says angrily, <<<
Stick to the art, please!

>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Oh, so it's a team-building exercise.
>>>  The Boss replies, <<<
I think of it more as a headcount reduction thing.
>>> 
1992-08-30 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit on a stone wall in the park.  Dilbert says, <<<
The problem with modern society is that we have no traditions.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
We should create some traditions for future generations.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
How do you create a tradition?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Well, you just do something ridiculous every year at the same time.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Eventually other people join in and then it's a tradition.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Ooh, how about 'Annual Nose-Sausage Day'?  You dress in colorful robes and stick sausages in your nose!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Yes, yes . . . And we'll do a squirrel dance and shout 'kaloo--kalah' at the sun!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Or maybe not.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
You lost me with the squirrel dance.
>>> 
1992-08-29 * 
The Boss sits at his desk looking through a stack of documents and thinking, <<<

Do you even know what project I'm working on?

I don't have time to get into minutia.
>>> 
1992-08-23 * 
Ted stands behind Dilbert's desk and says, <<<
I'm taking orders for 'Camp Girl cookies' on behalf of my daughter.
>>> Ted asks, <<<
How many dozen can I guilt you into buying?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I've always wondered, Ted, why do they sell cookies?  Is it just for the money?
>>> Ted replies, <<<
No, it's to help them build character by earning their own money.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Oh, so your daughter is doing some selling from door-to-door?
>>> Ted answers, <<<
No, too dangerous.  My wife and I are doing all the selling at work.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Well, then aren't you only teaching your daughter to act helpless so other people will do her work?
>>> Ted says angrily, <<<
Just buy the stupid cookies!!
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Have you considered foster care for your kids?
>>> 
1992-08-22 *

Wow, it's like you know her.

I'll yell 'Yes!' and pump my arms in a distinctive way.

Now I'm working on incorporating this spinning motion.

Yes!

This IS my hobby.

Let's see if my idea of using an electric cattle prod will boost employee productivity.

Mental note: hold rubber end.
>>> 
1992-08-13 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
My date was a fiasco.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
She has a rare disease called puppetitis - it makes your hand act like a puppet.

Apparently you can catch it by holding hands.

Glad to help.
>>> 
1992-08-09 *

Why should I hire you as my consultant?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I'll use my special process of cognitive dissonance to improve employee morale.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
How does it work?
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
When people are in an absurd situation, their minds rationalize it by inventing a comfortable illusion.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
Okay, go do it.
>>> Dogbert asks an employee, <<<
Isn't it strange that you have this dead end job when you're twice as smart as your boss?
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
The hours are long, the pay is mediocre, nobody respects your contributions, and yet you freely choose to work here.
>>>  The man looks upset. The man says, <<<
It's absurd!  No, wait . . . There must be a reason . . . I must work here because I LOVE the work.

I've sacrificed my health, my personal life and my soul to get promoted.

Maybe I'll host a special 'Low-Achiever Day' to let you touch my door.
>>>  Dilbert imagines closing Tim in his door. 
1992-08-04 * 
The Boss says to Tim, <<<
I understand you've been going without sleep or food for days just to meet some artificial deadline.
>>>  Tim mumbles incoherently. The Boss continues, <<<
As a result, your work has been muddle-brained and incomprehensible.  You leave me no choice, Tim.
>>> Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
Tim got promoted to division manager.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I wonder if he knows it.
>>> 
1992-08-03 * 
Dilbert says to Tim, <<<
Gee, Tim, you look awful.
>>>  Tim replies, <<<
I've been working for five days without any sleep to finish this report.

At first I had a mental block.  But on the fourth day I was visited by an Incan monkey god who told me what to write.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Wow, lucky break.
>>>  Tim says, <<<
Now I just have to find somebody who can translate his simple but beautiful language.
>>>

Dogbert and Dilbert walk through the park. Dilbert says, <<<
Nature is so wonderful . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
They say we don't leave the planet to future generations, we borrow it from our children.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
It's even better than that.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
WE don't have children, so we're borrowing the planet from complete strangers!
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
And there's no collateral.  We can use up the planet, have great lives and leave an empty smoking shell to the strangers!
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I tell you, people have completely overlooked the positive side of this environment situation.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But someday I WANT to have children.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Let's hope they're not as selfish as you.
>>> 
1992-08-01 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert walk outdoors.  Dilbert says, <<<
I thought I was happy . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Then I thought what if I only THINK I'm happy but I'm not.  Maybe I've been hypnotized and don't even know it.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Worrying about it made me unhappy, which means I must NOT be under hypnosis, so I'm happy.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Maybe I only THINK you're talking but really I'm happy.
>>> 
1992-07-31 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  A woman outside the cubicle says, <<<

It's not healthy to read them all at once, Bob.

Why are you protesting against this movie?
>>> The man replies, <<<
It portrays red heads as hot tempered and ignorant.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
How many red heads are in the movie?
>>> The man replies, <<<
One.  But the point is, red heads don't fit their stereotype of being hot tempered and ignorant.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Actually, ignorance was never a stereotype of red heads until you brought it up here.
>>> The man yells at the other protester, <<<
Sean, you idiot!  I told you!
>>>  Sean replies, <<<
Shut up, Dennis!  I'll pound you to a pulp!!

Dilbert says to the garbage man, <<<
I know that my computer model is accurate, but nobody believes me when I predict that squirrels will conquer the earth.
>>> The garbage man replies, <<<
Of course, you're aware that according to 'Chaos Theory' any complex iterative model is no better than a wild guess, even if the logic is perfect.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
You're making that up.
>>>  The garbage man says, <<<
You caught me; I'm really a giant spy squirrel in disguise.

The squirrels should love this guy.

It's based on actual math.

1992-07-21 * 
Dilbert hands a book to Dogbert and says, <<<
Here's the full script of the rest of your life.  My supercomputer model predicted it.

Well, according to this I'll be kidnapped by evil squirrels and forced to work in their nut mines.

They get me too.

You see, everything, including your brain chemistry, is subject to predictable patterns of cause and effect . . .
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
That's ridiculous.  It implies that we have no free will.
>>>  Dilbert looks at the monitor and says, <<<
Next, you start getting really mad at me.
>>> 
1992-07-19 * 
Dogbert and Dilbert walk through the park.  Dilbert says, <<<
Hey, that's Miss Mulput, my old fourth grade teacher.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Hi, Miss Mulput!  Do you remember me - Dilbert?
>>>  Miss Mulput replies, <<<
No.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You used to make me write on the board a thousand times 'I will not be homely in class.'
>>> Miss Mulput replies, <<<
Oh, yeah.  That was a good one.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
At the time it seemed like pretty strict punishment for chewing gum.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But that experience made me what I am today . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
An angry adult, obsessed with thoughts of revenge.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You know, Miss 'Molepit,' if my dog had your face I'd shave his hiney and make him walk backward.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Leave me out of this.
>>> 
1992-07-18 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I spent my entire fortune to buy this supercomputer.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
What does it do?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
It can calculate the value of pi to about a jillion decimal places . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
A lot of people TALK about the areas of circles, but I'm DOING something about it.
>>> 
1992-07-17 * 
Dilbert says to the garbage man, <<<
I've been miserable since I made my fortune in the stock market . . .
>>> The garbage man replies, <<<
It's the 'Law of Found Money.'  Nature won't allow us to keep money we find on the ground or win by chance.  Don't resist; let your intuition guide you.
>>> Dilbert stands in a computer retail store writing a check.  He asks the salesclerk, <<<
This comes with a color monitor, right?
>>>  The salesperson stands in front of a supercomputer labeled, <<<
Gray 9.  Only $10,000,000.
>>> 
1992-07-16 * 
Dilbert and a woman sit at a table in a restaurant.  Dilbert says, <<<
Gee, Mary, you weren't willing to date me BEFORE I made millions in the stock market.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I'm afraid you see me as just a big, talking wallet.
>>>  Mary replies, <<<
You're much more than that.
>>> Mary says, <<<
For example, you also wear thick glasses.
>>>  Dilbert says angrily, <<<
Too little, too late.
>>> 
1992-07-15 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on the hassock.  Dilbert's head is bandaged and his arm is in a sling.  Dilbert says, <<<
I've had nothing but tragedy since making a fortune in the stock market.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Sometimes, Dogbert, it seems like our lives have preset balances of joy and pain; when one gets too high the other kicks in to compensate.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But through it all, I always have you, my friend.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
At least until my good luck kicks in.
>>> 
1992-07-14 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert walk outdoors.  Dilbert says, <<<
I can't help thinking that my new wealth will lead to tragedy.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
It seems like rich people always have horrible tragedies.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Like what?
>>>  There is a flash of lightning. Dilbert's clothes have been burned and his body is charred.  Dilbert replies, <<<
. . . Like being struck by lightning on a clear day.
>>>  Dogbert points to the sky and shouts, <<<
Incoming meteor!!
>>> 
1992-07-13 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I'm going to work like a regular guy even though I just made a fortune in the stock market.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
That's because I still want to be a useful and contributing member of society.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
And of course, the workplace is the second most satisfying place to gloat.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Are you done here yet?
>>> 
1992-07-12 * 
Dogbert stands in front of a display case in a jewelry store.  The salesclerk asks, <<<
Are you interested in our diamond jewelry?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Let me see if I understand the concept here . . .
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
. . . I would give you thousands of dollars, and in return . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
. . . You would give me a pebble you found on the ground.
>>> The salesman says, <<<
These are no ordinary pebbles.  Diamonds are very rare.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Rare?  That's only because you made a marketing decision to restrict the supply.
>>> The clerk scoops some diamonds into a sack and says, <<<
Okay, okay, you figured us out.  I'll give you a free bag of diamonds if you'll go away and keep quiet.
>>> Dogbert walks on the sidewalk carrying a bag.  He says, <<<
Great . . . Now I'm a party to this ugly little secret.
>>> 
1992-07-11 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Am I wrong or did you tell me you invested all of your money in stock options for a company called Zymed?
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
The radio says the stock price tripled on takeover rumors.  You just made about ten million dollars.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
But they say money can't buy happiness.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Apparently 'they' are idiots.
>>> 
1992-07-10 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I invested all of my money in stock options.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
What's an option?
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
It's complicated . . . Basically, you give your money to a stock broker and he buys nice things for his family.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Do you have any snide comments?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
No, you took all the fun out of it.
>>> 
1992-07-09 * 
Dilbert and the financial advisor sit at the table.  The advisor says as Dilbert reads a brochure, <<<
That's our new 'Strategic Diversification Fund.'
>>> The man continues, <<<
Our lawyers put your money in little bags, then we have trained dogs bury them around town.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Do they bury the bags or the lawyers?
>>>  The advisor replies, <<<
We've tried it both ways.
>>> 
1992-07-08 * 
Dilbert and the financial advisor sit at the table.  The advisor says, <<<
For the timid investor, I recommend our 'Perpetual Certificates of Deposit.'
>>> The man continues, <<<
They earn the highest possible interest.  The only trade-off is that you can never withdraw it.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why don't I just fling my money out a window?
>>>  The advisor replies, <<<
Ah, you've heard of our 'Flying Debenture' product?
>>> 
1992-07-07 * 
Dilbert and the financial advisor sit at the table.  The advisor says, <<<
I recommend our 'Churn 'N' Burn' family of mutual funds.
>>> The man continues, <<<
We'll turn your worthless equity into valuable brokerage fees in just three days!
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Is it risky?
>>>  The advisor replies, <<<
Are you kidding?!  We have actual brochures!
>>> 
1992-07-06 * 
Dogbert answers the door and a man in a suit says, <<<
Hi!  I want to be your financial advisor.
>>> The man continues, <<<
I've come to live with you.  We'll eventually form a lifelong bond of trust and friendship.
>>> Dogbert says angrily, <<<
I liked better when you guys just took our money.
>>>  The man says, <<<
I recommend a strategy called 'Churn.'
>>> 
1992-07-05 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  The Boss enters and says, <<<
Dilbert, do you have a minute?
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
The company is doing an survey of employee attitudes about their bosses.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
It's totally anonymous, so you don't have to fear any retribution.
>>> The Boss opens an envelope and says, <<<
Oops!  It looks like your questionnaire is a bit dog-eared.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I'll put my phone number on the confidential envelope in case you need me.
>>> The Boss hands Dilbert a pen and says, <<<
You can use this green marker pen.
>>> The Boss adds, <<<
Oh, and I took the liberty of checking off your ethnic background as Eskimo.  It's just a statistical thing.
>>> Dilbert reads, <<<
1. Does your boss clearly communicate your objectives?
>>> 
1992-07-04 * 
A woman hands Dilbert a baby and says, <<<
Everybody in the office gets a turn holding my new baby.
>>>  Ted says, <<<
Next.
>>> Dilbert holds the baby and thinks, <<<
Uh-oh . . . Sneeze coming.
>>>  Dilbert sneezes. Dilbert looks at the baby and says, <<<
Ooh!  Look what he does when you sneeze on him.
>>>  Ted says, <<<
He looks like a prune!
>>>  The mother looks shocked. 
1992-07-03 * 
Dilbert stands in his house talking on the telephone.  His clothes are disheveled.  Dilbert says into the phone, <<<
Lucky Airlines?  I demand payment for the luggage I lost when we crashed into the mountain.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
No, technically it's not 'lost.' . . . Well, yes, I did eat your complimentary peanuts . . .
>>> Dilbert hands the phone to Dogbert and says, <<<
Help me out here . . . So far, I've agreed to hot-wax their tarmac.
>>> 
1992-07-02 * 
Dogbert, Dilbert, a man in a pilot's uniform and another man stand on a snow-covered mountain where their airplane crashed.  Dogbert says, <<<
Captain Bob, I think you're planning to eat the other survivors.
>>> Captain Bob replies, <<<
Ha ha!  Too bad your only hope is to send a message to the village at the base of this mountain.
>>> Dogbert throws a snowball at the captain, knocking him off his feet.  Dogbert says, <<<
When you roll into town, tell them Dogbert sent you.
>>> 
1992-07-01 * 
Dilbert, Dogbert, a captain and several people stand on a snow-covered mountain.  Off in the distance is a crashed airplane.  A man in a pilot's uniform says, <<<
I've survived several jet crashes this year, so listen to me.
>>> The man continues, <<<
The best way to prevent frostbite is to rub Worcestershire sauce on your body and whack yourself repeatedly with a meat tenderizer.
>>> As people pour sauce on themselves Dilbert thinks, <<<
I wonder why he had enough of these for everybody?
>>> 
1992-06-30 * 
Dilbert, Dogbert and several other passengers stand in waist-deep snow.  Dilbert says, <<<
We're alive . . . We must have been thrown clear when the jet hit the mountain.
>>> The airplane captain says to Dilbert, <<<
I'm Captain Bob.  Sorry about the crash.  What are the odds I'd hit this same mountain on every flight?
>>> As Bob walks away Dilbert says, <<<
We're in luck.  Captain Bob knows how to survive these situations.
>>>  Bob thinks, <<<
Nice folks.  I'll eat them last.
>>> 
1992-06-29 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit in airplane seats.  Dilbert says, <<<
This will be our most memorable vacation yet.
>>> The flight attendant says, <<<
. . . And in the event of a snowy mountainside crash, the young and feeble passengers are completely edible.
>>> As the plane flies by a mountain into which three planes have crashed, the flight attendant says, <<<
But Captain Bob promises he won't make that mistake again.
>>> 
1992-06-28 * 
Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
I'm going to start jogging again.
>>> Dilbert wears a sweatshirt and sweatpants.  He leans down to tie his sneakers and thinks, <<<
Why does everybody tie their laces in the same type of knot?
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
From an engineering perspective, there are planety of good alternatives to the standard knot.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
This is how innovation begins; one man who refuses to accept the conventional wisdom.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Ha ha!  I'll invent my own knot!  A rebellious, audacious knot!
>>> Dilbert pulls the shoelaces and shouts, <<<
Like this and this and this!  Ha ha ha!!
>>> Dogbert enters the bedroom and sees Dilbert lying on the floor with his laces wrapped around his body.  Dogbert says, <<<
Many people wonder why there haven't been more engineers in the Olympics.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Call the Boy Scouts.
>>> 
1992-06-27 * 
Dogbert stands in a dark classroom holding a pointer and using an overhead projector.  Dogbert says, <<<
This is the story of Clayton the Auto Mechanic.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Clayton smoked cigars while working on gasoline engines.  What problem did this cause?
>>>  The projector shows an explosion. A man wrapped in bandages says, <<<
He was hit by lightning every time?
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Does anybody beside Clayton have a guess?
>>> 
1992-06-26 * 
Dogbert hands a man a pair of scissors and says, <<<
Todd, show the class how you hand these scissors to Russell.
>>> Dogbert yells, <<<
Don't run!  Don't run!
>>>  Russell screams. Todd looks down at Russell, who is lying on the floor, and says, <<<
Sorry, Russell.  It's the teacher's fault; he didn't even ask if I need left-handed scissors.
>>> 
1992-06-25 * 
Dogbert asks, <<<
Who can show me how to get the water out of this boot?
>>> Dogbert hands the boot to a woman and says, <<<
If you have trouble, the directions are written on the heel.
>>> As the woman puts her head into the boot, Dogbert says, <<<
I'm sorry, Betty.  I can only give you partial credit for trying to absorb the liquid with your hair.
>>> 
1992-06-24 * 
Dogbert says to a classroom full of people at desks, <<<
Welcome to Dogbert's School of Common Sense.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I've asked you to pay tuition in advance; that way if you're unsatisfied with the school, you'll have the added negotiation leverage of having already paid.
>>> As the students hand Dogbert money he says, <<<
And thanks, Alice, for asking if tipping is customary.
>>> 
1992-06-23 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair reading the newspaper and Dogbert sits on the hassock.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm going to open a school for people with no common sense.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Who would pay to go to a school that teaches something that can't be learned?
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Except maybe people with no common sense . . .
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Bingo.
>>> 
1992-06-22 * 
Dilbert sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
Tell me what you've accomplished this year so I can write your performance appraisal.
>>> Dilbert answers, <<<
The inventions I made last year - that you thought were worthless, will generate twelve million in license fees next year!
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
So, no real accomplishments THIS year?
>>> 
1992-06-21 * 
Dogbert sits at the table drawing on a piece of paper.  He thinks, <<<
Another masterpiece.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What are you doing, Dogbert?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I discovered a highly efficient art form.
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
I've brilliantly combined the simplicity of charcoal with the simplicity of abstract expression.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
The secret is to let your deepest inner feelings guide the charcoal.
>>> Dilbert looks at a drawing and says, <<<
Inner feelings?!  What inner feelings?  These are scribbles.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
All I see here is that a cynical dog thinks art buyers are a bunch of gullible morons.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Wow!  I nailed that one!
>>> 
1992-06-20 * 
Dilbert stands in front of a customer service desk at a bank.  Dilbert says, <<<
I'd like to apply for a 'Bank of Ethel' credit card.
>>>  The woman behind the desk says, <<<
Sit down and shut up.
>>> The woman says, <<<
It's 21&#037; interest plus surprisingly high annual fees.  We'll do a credit check and a full body cavity search.
>>> Back at home, Dilbert stands in front of Dogbert wearing just his boxers.  Dilbert says, <<<
. . . And I had to smile the whole time because they were filming it for their television ads.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
You have to admire their attitude.
>>> 
1992-06-19 * 
Dilbert, Wally and Ted sit at a conference table.  Dilbert says, <<<
Maybe Ted can answer that question . . .
>>>  Ted thinks, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> Ted thinks, <<<
They're trying to make me work.  I'll have to use body language to discourage them.
>>> Ted puts a pencil up his nose and rubs his head.  Dilbert says, <<<
Uh . . . Never mind.
>>>  Ted thinks, <<<
It's working.
>>> 
1992-06-18 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert and a woman, <<<
I'm proud to announce that the company has found yet another way to dehumanize the employees.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
From now on you will wear identification badges at work.  This symbolizes that people who look like you are often criminals.
>>> The Boss adds, <<<
Oh . . . And the cafeteria is closed.  We'll just lay down some alfalfa in the break room.
>>> 
1992-06-17 * 
Dogbert sits at a desk counting bags of money and humming.  Dilbert says, <<<
A news crew is here to investigate your television healing scam.
>>> Dogbert sits in a chair across from a reporter and a tv camera.  The reporter says, <<<
Explain to our 40 million viewers where the money actually goes.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Send those checks to Dogbert, post office box . . .
>>>  The reporter thinks, <<<
Maybe I phrased that wrong.
>>> 
1992-06-16 * 
On his television program, Dogbert stands in front of a curtain and holds a microphone.  Dogbert says, <<<
Welcome to my show, 'Healing for Dollars.'
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Today I will use my psychic healing power to prevent millions of people from getting pimples on their tongues.

Ith working!  Get the theckbook!
>>> 
1992-06-15 * 
Dilbert asks Dogbert, <<<
What did you do to your hair?
>>>  Dogbert's hair is styled in a pompadour. Dogbert replies, <<<
It's for my new television show, 'Healing for Dollars.'  People send more money if you have this kind of hair.
>>> A man and a woman sit on a couch watching Dogbert's tv show.  The woman says, <<<
It might be a trick.
>>>  The man replies, <<<
That's what I thought until I saw his hair.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Checks or money order.
>>> 
1992-06-14 * 
A small building is marked, <<<
Dogbert's Confess-O-Rama.
>>>  One door is labeled, <<<
Employees Only" and the other is labeled, <<<
Sinners.
>>> Dogbert sits on one side of a confessional and a man sits on the other.  The man says, <<<
Dogbert, I have sinned.
>>> The man continues, <<<
I was going to make chocolate chip cookies . . .
>>> The man continues, <<<
But I made the mistake of tasting a chocolate chip right from the bag.
>>> The man continues, <<<
Before I knew it, I had scarfed the entire bag of chips!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
For penance you must make a little dunce hat from old "Cathy" comic strips . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Then wear the little hat while dancing naked on your lawn with the sprinklers on.
>>>  The man says, <<<
Thank you, Dogbert.
>>> Dogbert turns to the reader and says, <<<
It's so rewarding to be able to give something back to the community.
>>> 
1992-06-13 * 
Dogbert sits on the hassock watching television.  A weather reporter concludes, <<<
. . . And that's the CNN weather report.
>>> Ted Turner appears wearing a tank top.  He says, <<<
Hey!  Don't just sit there watching tv all day!  Give me thirty tummy crunches!

It's been nothing but mixed messages since Ted married Jane.

Dogbert sits on the hassock watching television.  A newscaster says, <<<
At the top of the news: solar flares.

CNN correspondent Wolf Blitzer is on the scene.
>>> Wolf Blitzer says, <<<
It's another hot day on the sun, Bernie.
>>>  Dogbert thinks, <<<
Show-offs.
>>> 
1992-06-11 * 
Dilbert and the other employees walk around the office as if in a trance, saying, <<<
Quality . . . Quality . . . Quality . . .
>>>  The Boss thinks, <<<
It's working.  All the employees are brainwashed.
>>> The Boss yells, <<<
I've done it!  I've transformed the very fabric of the corporate culture!
>>> Dilbert says to Wally, <<<
Things sure have changed around here.
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
Yeah, for example, my arms are tired.
>>> 
1992-06-10 * 
Dilbert says to a man, <<<
It looks like Brenda has been brainwashed by the new company slogan.
>>>  Brenda walks by as if in a trance saying, <<<
Quality . . . Quality . . .
>>> Dilbert shows the man a pad of paper and says, <<<
It all started when we got these little sticky note pads that say 'quality' on them.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Oops, sorry, I shouldn't put it right in your face . . .
>>>  The man goes into a trance and says, <<<
Quality . . . Quality . . . Quality . . .

We've got to make drastic changes to keep up with the competition.

That's why I've had these little note pads made that say 'quality.'

Isn't it spelled with a 'u?'
>>> 
1992-06-07 * 
Dogbert stands at the front of the room and says, <<<
Today's lesson is just for men . . . Lights please.
>>> Dogbert shows a slide that says, <<<
Acting sensitive even when you're not.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
As males, we know that women can only tolerate us when we act phony.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
This is what happens when a woman is subjected to honest male opinions.
>>>  The slide shows a woman screaming. Dogbert continues, <<<
Fortunately, even the most ridiculous lies can sound sensitive.
>>>  The slide shows a man saying, <<<
Nice hairdo.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
And new research shows that women want EMPATHY in conversation, not male suggestions.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
This discovery frees you to think about other things while they talk.
>>>  Dogbert advances the slide projector. The slide shows a man saying to a woman, <<<
Ooh . . . How sad,

Sports.

Questions?

Yeah.  I'm planning to gnaw the parents to death tomorrow.
>>> 
1992-06-04 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
Nobody ever calls on my new video phone so I routed the television signal to it.

Now I can pretend that celebrities are calling me all day.
>>> Dilbert says as he walks away, <<<
Ooh . . . Dolly Parton is calling.  I'll bet it's for me again.
>>> 
1992-06-03 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk staring at the video phone.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Did anybody call on your new video phone yet?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
No.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Don't you think that the only people who will buy video phones are male techie dweebs like you?
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Therefore, wouldn't it be cheaper to buy a mirror?
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
It's hell being an early adopter.
>>> 
1992-06-02 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the desk watching the video phone.  Dilbert says, <<<
This video phone will be a big help for dating.

This way I can weed out the unattractive prospects in seconds.

Isn't there a camera on your end too?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
No system is perfect.

Dilbert says, <<<
Dogbert, look, I got the first video phone in the city!
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the desk as Dilbert sets up the video phone.  Dilbert says, <<<
Now we wait for somebody else to buy a compatible video phone and call us.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
The amazing thing is that society couldn't advance without people like you.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I think I saw something.
>>> 
1992-05-31 * 
Dilbert sits across from a man's desk.  The man says, <<<
Thanks for your time, Dilbert.  It's always good to get the technical perspective.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Hey, it's lunchtime.  Would you like to join me in the cafeteria?
>>> The man replies, <<<
Ooh . . . No, I couldn't do that.
>>> The man explains, <<<
I'm on the management track, so I can't be seen eating lunch with you.
>>> The man continues, <<<
If I'm seen with an ordinary employee then people will think I'm ordinary.
>>> The man continues, <<<
I'd like to eat with the senior executives, but of course they don't want to be seen with me.
>>> The man slides under his desk and says, <<<
So I've perfected a method of slipping quietly away at lunch time.
>>> Dilbert turns to the reader and says, <<<
The scary part is that someday that man will be my boss.
>>> 
1992-05-30 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, Wally and Alice, <<<
My consultant advised me to handle the layoffs in a direct, professional way.
>>> The Boss holds up a rubber stamp and continues, <<<
So, throughout the day I'll be sneaking up on people and stamping 'Canceled' on their backs.
>>> As Wally runs away, Alice says, <<<
Let me see if I understand . . .
>>>  The Boss points and says, <<<
Hey!  Is that the Goodyear blimp?
>>> 
1992-05-29 * 
Dogbert points to a picture of a bathroom and tells the Boss, <<<
As your consultant, I recommend the 'Can-O-Matic' to reduce staff levels.
>>> Dogbert points to a picture of a person falling out a building window and explains, <<<
Disguised as a restroom stall, the Can-O-Matic randomly fires people by slapping a pink slip on their backs and catapulting them out of the building.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
But I won't get to see the expressions on their faces.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Well, we could fling them past the security cameras here . . .
>>> 
1992-05-28 * 
Dogbert sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
I need an outside consultant like you to help with layoffs.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
My main concern is to minimize the pain and hardship that goes with this.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
With generous severance pay?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
No, I think that would only make my pain and suffering worse.
>>> 
1992-05-27 *

Hello, ladies.
>>> The man says, <<<
I'm Wilt Ghandi.  I'm the product of a genetic experiment combining the wisdom of Wilt Chamberlain and the body of Ghandi.
>>> One woman says, <<<
That's the best line tonight.  I'm going for it.
>>>  The other woman says, <<<
Hey, I saw him first.
>>> 
1992-05-26 * 
Dogbert stands at a lab table and says, <<<
I'll use Dilbert's genetic lab to make a man with the wisdom of Ghandi and the strength of Wilt Chamberlain.
>>> Dogbert thinks, <<<
Or vice versa.
>>> A man wearing an Indian pancha says to Dilbert, <<<
Gimme your car keys.  I'm gonna find us some babes.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Not in MY sheet.
>>> 
1992-05-25 * 
Dilbert sits at the table working with test tubes and lab equipment.  Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
Sometimes I wonder if it's ethical to do these genetic experiments.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But I rationalize it because it will help improve the quality of life.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
What are you making?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Skunkopotamus.
>>> 
1992-05-24 * 
Dogbert walks on the sidewalk.  He sees an old woman holding a stick and says, <<<
Mother Nature!
>>>  Mother Nature says, <<<
Hi, Dogbert, you little lard bag.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Geez, Mother Nature, why are you so mean?
>>> Mother Nature replies, <<<
I'm not mean; it's natural.  Nature seems cruel but it's really beautiful.
>>> Mother Nature continues, <<<
For example, do you see that robin that's singing?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Yes?
>>> Mother Nature zaps the bird with her stick. As feathers float down from the tree, Mother Nature says, <<<
He was off-key.  Now nature is back in harmony.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Ha!  You're smiling!  I knew it.  You enjoy being mean!
>>> Dogbert walks down the sidewalk looking disheveled.  Clouds of smoke rise from his fur.  Dogbert says, <<<
Yet another example where keen perception doesn't pay off.
>>> 
1992-05-23 * 
A woman says to Dilbert, <<<
. . . So then I spent a year in Europe and blah blah blah blah.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Hey, I think I can see your brain through your nose!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Anyway . . . You were saying . . . ?

Dave sits at his desk.  The Boss enters and says, <<<
Dave, I hear that you've started cutting your own hair . . .
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
I'm afraid I'll have to drop you from the management fast-track program.
>>> The Boss walks away thinking, <<<
Lucky we caught that one before he got too far.
>>> 
1992-05-21 * 
Dilbert asks a man, <<<
What happened to your head, Dave?
>>>  Dave replies, <<<
I'm cutting my own hair now.
>>>  Dave's hair is unevenly cut and shaved in places. Dave continues, <<<
I'm not too far along the old learning curve, but at least I'm saving money.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How much did you save?
>>>  Dave replies, <<<
Not counting the divorce and therapy?
>>> 
1992-05-20 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I didn't approve of you buying Lenin's body to begin with . . .
>>>  The body lies across milk crates. Dilbert continues, <<<
And I certainly don't approve of you making a desk out of it.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Are you listening to me?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Hey, if I flip him over I can use his nostrils as a pencil holder!
>>> 
1992-05-19 * 
Ratbert says to Dogbert, <<<
Wow!  You bought Lenin's body?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Only ten dollars.
>>>  Lenin's stiff body leans against the wall. Dogbert says, <<<
Now I have to decide what to do with it.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
You could build a museum.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I was thinking of using him as a coffee table.
>>> 
1992-05-18 * 
Dogbert walks down the sidewalk and a man standing against a building whispers, <<<
Pssst!  Dog!  Would you like to purchase Lenin's body?
>>> The man continues, <<<
Twenty bucks.  He's in great shape . . . The king of commies . . . Not available in stores.
>>> Back at home, Dogbert pushes a man's body against the wall.  Dilbert asks, <<<
. . . And you talked him down to ten dollars?
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Do you like it better against this wall?
>>> 
1992-05-17 * 
Dogbert stands in front of a store with a sign that says, <<<
Tennis rackets on sale.
>>> Dogbert tells the salesclerk, <<<
I'm looking for a new racket.
>>> The clerk says, <<<
You're probably interested in our colorful all-plastic rackets for pathetic beginners.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
No, actually I'm interested in the titanium alloy Deathstick 3000.
>>> The salesperson laughs and says, <<<
Ha ha!  As if a dumpy little pooch could handle that kind of power on the court!
>>> The salesman hands Dogbert a racket and says, <<<
Here . . . You can touch it, but I'm only humoring you.
>>> The salesclerk crashes through the wall. Dogbert holds the racket and says, <<<
This is the perfect racket for those who don't take losing gracefully.
>>> 
1992-05-16 * 
A man sits at a conference table with two co-workers.  He thinks, <<<
I'm feeling confident today with what appears to be a full head of hair.
>>> The man thinks, <<<
Nobody suspects that I'm actually combing the hair that grows in my ears over the top of my otherwise bald head.
>>> The man thinks, <<<
It's amazing how clueless these people are.
>>> 
1992-05-15 * 
A man says, <<<
Hey, that's a good technique: combing your ear hair over the bald spot!
>>> The man continues, <<<
I've been working on the eyebrows-combed-over-the-head method.
>>> The man with the ear hair thinks, <<<
Somebody should talk to that man.
>>> 
1992-05-14 * 
Larry King sits at a table and says into the microphone, <<<
Tonight on 'Larry King Live' we have a dog who makes sexy beer commercials, plus an angry feminist.
>>> The woman points to Dogbert and says, <<<
His commercials encourage discrimination against women by portraying us all as sex objects.
>>> Dogbert asks the woman, <<<
Are you saying men are so dumb, they get their views on life from beer commercials?
>>>  The woman crosses her arms and says, <<<
I call them like I see them.
>>> 
1992-05-13 * 
A man sitting at a conference table next to another man says, <<<
We like you proposed ad campaign, Dogbert, but we think it needs some scantily clad women in it.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Gentlemen, this is the nineties.  That concept is offensive and out-dated.
>>> One man says, <<<
Ooh-ooh!  What if they had jobs?
>>>  The other man says, <<<
Bikini lawyers on skates!
>>> 
1992-05-12 * 
Dogbert stands in front of two men and points to a diagram.  Dogbert says, <<<
We must turn the negatives of your project into perceived benefits.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
The new slogan will be 'Shmultz Beer: you know it's working because your head pounds.'"  Dogbert points to a picture of a man who is holding a beer and has a headache. A man asks, <<<
Can you work some bikinis into this concept?
>>>  The other man says, <<<
We're very lonely men.
>>> 
1992-05-11 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair reading the newspaper and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm going to open the 'Dogbert Advertising Company.'
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Apparently, people will believe just about anything that makes them feel good.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Hey, don't underestimate our intelligence.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I could never underestimate you intelligence.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Apology accepted.
>>> 
1992-05-10 * 
Dilbert stands at the stove wearing an apron and looking into a pot. Dilbert asks Dogbert, <<<
How can I tell when spaghetti is cooked?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I'll have to wear the hat to answer that question.
>>> Dogbert walks back into the room wearing a chef's hat. Dogbert answers, <<<
The spaghetti is done when you can throw it at the wall and make it stick.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Seems odd . . . But he was wearing the hat.
>>> Dogbert hears, <<<
Whap!  Splash!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Preferably, one strand at a time.
>>> 
1992-05-09 * 
Ratbert says to Bob the Dinosaur, <<<
Bob, sometimes I wonder if there's a place in this world for a sensitive rat like me.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
I can't live the hollow, meaningless shell of existence that others so ironically call 'life.'
>>> Ratbert concludes, <<<
I want to make a difference to people.
>>>  Bob says, <<<
Well, you ruined MY day.
>>> 
1992-05-08 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, Wally and Alice, <<<
Sometimes you have to move forward just to stay where you are.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  If you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem.
>>> The Boss asks, <<<
How can we use our strengths against our competitors' weaknesses?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
We could bore them to death with your cliches.
>>> 
1992-05-07 * 
Dogbert sits on a pillow thinking, <<<
I've made little progress toward my goal of being supreme ruler of earth.
>>> Dogbert thinks, <<<
Obviously it's not my fault.  Somebody else must be to blame.
>>> Dogbert stares at Dilbert who is sitting at his desk.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
I hate it when he just stares.
>>> 
1992-05-06 * 
Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
Look out!  Big Ed is hulking backwards waving his arms again!
>>> Big Ed bumps into Wally and Dilbert and they spill their coffee on themselves. Wally and Dilbert lie on the floor with their legs in the air. Dilbert says, <<<
Big people can be so annoying.
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
I just wish he wouldn't refer to us as debris.
>>> 
1992-05-05 * 
Dilbert says to a man sitting at a desk behind piles of paper, <<<
Hi . . . Are you new here?  I've never seen you before.
>>> The man says, <<<
I'm the lost employee . . . I've been hiding in the bureaucracy since the fifties . . . Paid but forgotten.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Wouldn't THAT be the perfect job . . .
>>> 
1992-05-04 * 
A man looks in a cabinet marked <<<
Office Supplies.
>>>  The man thinks, <<<
Wow!  A fresh shipment!

Mine!  All mine!

While you were up, someone took your desk.
>>>

Dilbert and Dogbert walk out of a restaurant.  The sign in the window says, <<<
All you can eat $7.00.
>>> A man yells, <<<
Hey!  Stop!
>>> The waiter says, <<<
You owe us another $14.
>>> The waiter continues, <<<
You deliberately put more than you could eat on your plates.
>>> The man continues, <<<
Technically, our agreement is 'all you can eat,' not 'all you can waste.'
>>> The man thinks, <<<
Mom wanted me to be a lawyer, but I said, 'No, food services is where I'm needed.'
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I believe this is your department, Dogbert.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Technically, it's all you CAN eat, not all you DO eat.
>>>  The man thinks, <<<
Ooh . . . He's good.
>>> 
1992-05-02 * 
Dogbert and Ratbert sit on a hassock.  Ratbert says, <<<
Dogbert, sometimes I think you're the only one who respects me.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Wrong.
>>> Ratbert thinks, <<<
Maybe I should drop it while there's still some ambiguity.
>>> 
1992-05-01 * 
Dogbert stands at the table reading a card.  Dilbert asks, <<<
How are you coming on designing your greeting cards for death occasions?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Okay.  Now I'm working on the humorous angle.
>>> Dilbert reads, <<<
Roses are red, / Violets are blue, / Cardboard is stiff, / And so are you.
>>> 
1992-04-30 * 
Dogbert sits at the table writing on some cards.  Dilbert asks, <<<
What are you working on?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I'm designing a line of cards for death occasions.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
You know how sometimes you can't make it to the funeral, so you want to send a card instead . . .
>>> Dilbert reads, <<<
I'm sorry you're dead.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Is it too sentimental?
>>> 
1992-04-29 * 
Dilbert hands the Boss a report and says, <<<
Here's my report.  It's some of my best work.
>>> The Boss puts the report through a portable shredder that is hanging around his neck. Dilbert says, <<<
I hate that porto-shredder.
>>>  The Boss asks, <<<
Say, is that a silk necktie?
>>> 
1992-04-28 * 
A man sitting on a mat says to Dilbert, <<<
To reach cosmic joy you must give away all of your possessions.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What if I give everything away but still do not achieve cosmic joy?
>>> The ascetic replies, <<<
Then the cosmic joy is on you.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I'm starting to see how this works.
>>> 
1992-04-27 * 
Dilbert sits on the floor across from a man in a robe.  The ascetic says, <<<
You must renounce all physical pleasure before you can achieve true cosmic joy.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Renounce it?!  Heck, I don't think I've ever HAD a physical pleasure!
>>> The spiritual advisor says, <<<
And you must shave your head . . .
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Oh, I get it; then you can rub the little stubble as it grows in!
>>> 
1992-04-26 * 
Dogbert sits at his desk under a sign that says, <<<
I will listen to your sad story $5.00.

I have a sad story.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Sit down.
>>> The man continues, <<<
I was a world renowned monkey trainer.
>>> The man continues, <<<
I had it all: fame, money, beautiful family.
>>> The man continues, <<<
Then I discovered that the monkeys were plotting against me.
>>> The man continues, <<<
They embezzled all of my money and kidnapped my wife.
>>> The man covers his eyes and says, <<<
Then my wife fell in love with their leader, Bing-Bong.
>>>  Dogbert laughs. The man asks, <<<
Were you laughing?
>>>  Dogbert hands money to the man and says, <<<
Here's my five bucks.  Thanks.
>>> 
1992-04-25 * 
Dilbert sits on a pillow listening to the radio.  Ratbert walks in and says, <<<
I'm having a crisis of self image.
>>> Ratbert asks, <<<
Do I, as a rat, add any value to the world?  Or do I simply deplete its resources, then die?
>>> The musical notes coming from the radio stick to Ratbert's body.  He says, <<<
Oh . . . Sorry . . . I sucked all the music out of the room.
>>> 
1992-04-24 * 
Dilbert and a woman sit at a table in a restaurant.  The woman grabs her throat and says, <<<
Mphf!  Aack!  Cough!  Hmp!  Gurgle!
>>> As the woman slumps onto the table, Dilbert says, <<<
If you're pretending to choke to death to end our date early, it won't work.
>>> The woman sits up and crosses her arms.  Dilbert says, <<<
Like I haven't seen that trick a jillion times.
>>> 
1992-04-23 * 
Dilbert stands over an unconscious man.  Another man yells, <<<
Aaagh!  You whacked Randy with your remote control airplane!!!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Oops!
>>> The man continues to yell, <<<
I'm warning you, frisbee people and airplane people don't mix . . . Like cattle and sheep . . . You'll pay for this!!  I swear . . .
>>> Another remote control plane hits the man in the head and knocks him out.  Dilbert says, <<<
Good one, Dogbert.
>>> 
1992-04-22 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert play with a remote control airplane outdoors.  The plane begins to move and Dilbert says, <<<
Approaching take-off velocity . . .
>>> Dilbert hears a <<<
Whap!  Thud!
>>> in the distance. A man holding a frisbee lies on the ground with the model plane stuck to his head.  Dilbert says, <<<
Gee, you'd think he'd know it's reckless to play frisbee in a populated area.
>>> 
1992-04-21 * 
Dogbert sits on the hassock laughing.  Dilbert says, <<<
I know you're only trying to make me THINK you've played a prank on me!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Well, two can play this game, my friend.
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert sit on the hassock laughing maniacally.  Ratbert enters and asks, <<<
Is this a bad time to visit?
>>> 
1992-04-20 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert enters and chuckles. Dilbert says, <<<
Stop it, Dogbert!  You're making that 'heh-heh' sound so I'll think you've played some hideous prank.
>>> Dogbert laughs harder and Dilbert thinks, <<<
No . . . Not the maniacal laugh.
>>> 
1992-04-19 * 
Dogbert sits on a pillow listening to the radio.  Dilbert says, <<<
Dogbert, come look at our new car!
>>> They stand next to an automobile.  Dilbert says, <<<
It has all of the most important safety features.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
You got your anti-lock brakes, your reinforced bumpers, your automatic seatbelts and your driver-side air bag.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I didn't hear 'passenger side air bag' in that list.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It turns out that it's only economical to save the person who makes the buying decision.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But I got a baby seat in case you want to use that.
>>> Dogbert says angrily, <<<
Well, thank you for letting me choose between humiliation and death.  I've got a better idea.
>>> Dogbert drives the car and Dilbert sits in the passenger seat.  Dilbert says, <<<
Ooh . . . Just wait until MY turn.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Watch me ram that car.
>>> 
1992-04-18 * 
Ratbert and Dogbert stand on the sidewalk.  Ratbert stomps on a bug and says, <<<
The mighty hunter strikes his wily prey!
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
The hunter is awash in manly hormones.  He has mastered his sport and conquered one of nature's best.

I used to feel guilty about this until I realized it's a sport.
>>> 
1992-04-17 * 
Dilbert sits across from the Boss's desk thinking, <<<
I sit here motionless while the Boss reads my report.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I can't talk while he's reading, and I don't have anything of my own to read . . .
>>> The Boss reads the report and thinks, <<<
I wonder how long I can make him sit there feeling uncomfortable?
>>>  Dilbert sings to himself, <<<
A hundred bottles of beer on the wall.
>>> 
1992-04-16 * 
Dilbert and three people sit at a conference table.  The woman next to Dilbert says, <<<
Don't mind me today . . . It's almost time for my 'friend' to visit.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
That's funny . . . I would think you'd be in a good mood if a friend were going to visit.
>>> Back at home, Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
She looked puffy, but she struck like a cobra.

1992-04-15 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Ratbert says, <<<
I've developed a plan to make you pity me and then welcome me in your family.
>>> Ratbert shows Dilbert a roll of toilet paper with a face drawn on it.  Ratbert says, <<<
I built Timmy the Toilet Paper Man.  Timmy will be my only friend.  It will be so pathetic that you will have to love me.
>>> Ratbert shows Dogbert an empty roll of toilet paper and says, <<<
Dilbert seems to have very little respect for Timmy.
>>> 
1992-04-14 *

Forget Dogbert; I can be your new best friend!

Rats are twice as good for cuddling and you should see me catch a frisbee!
>>> Ratbert points to his head and says, <<<
Here, scratch behind my ears.  You'll find me most appreciative!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
You sound like me on a date.
>>> 
1992-04-13 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair reading and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs reading.  Ratbert asks, <<<
Why does Dogbert always get to sit on your legs and I never do?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Because Dogbert is my best friend and you're just a disease-carrying vermin.
>>> Ratbert thinks, <<<
Maybe this isn't the time to launch my 'family hug time' concept.
>>> 
1992-04-12 * 
The panel is titled, <<<
Dogbert's Guide to Movie Advertisements.

>>> The advertisement says, <<<
'Funniest movie of the year.'"  Dogbert says, <<<
He saw it in mid-January.

Four stars . . . A masterpiece!'"  Dogbert says, <<<
The movie studio only paid off one critic.  Must be a low-budget film.

'Powerful performances.'"  Dogbert says, <<<
It's a downer.  Somebody probably gets a disease and loses the farm.
>>> The advertisement says, <<<
'I loved it!'  -Floyd Belcher, Nosehair Magazine.

Stallone's funniest movie yet.

Yeah . . .

What kind of microwave oven is this?

That's a fifty MIP Sparc workstation, Brent.
>>> Brent places a croissant on the monitor and thinks, <<<
In other words, it's going to take FOREVER to warm my croissant.
>>> 
1992-04-10 * 
A man says to Dilbert, <<<
Think of the company as a person.  We in marketing would be the 'brains.'

The sales department would be the 'body.'"  Dilbert asks, <<<
What's engineering?
>>> The man replies, <<<
The snot.
>>> 
1992-04-09 * 
A man in a robe points to a well and says to Dilbert, <<<

Why not Friday?

Friday is your day in the well.

A man holding a drink and wearing a robe and a wreath of leaves on his head says to Dilbert, <<<
You look lost.

I'm off to my new job as an MTV reporter.
>>> Dogbert holds a microphone and stands next to a man wearing gold chains and a cap.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Rap star Freshy Q, what is the key to your success?

Always be yourself.  Don't follow the crowd.  Be true to your instincts.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Did YOU invent rap?
>>>  Freshy Q replies, <<<
Uh . . . No.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Oh, but you probably pioneered this style of dressing.
>>>  Freshy Q replies, <<<
Not exactly.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
But you write all of your own music.
>>>  Freshy Q says, <<<
No . . . I buy it.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
The dance steps?
>>>  Freshy Q replies, <<<
I hire a choreographer.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Well, I'll bet nobody else folds his arms quite like you.

I don't like the direction this is heading.

Hey, I feel perfectly healthy right now.

My work here is done.

Tha-a-at's it.  You're on the list.
>>> 
1992-04-01 * 
Dogbert sits across from the President's desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
So, Mister President, a tax rebate for dogs is the only fair way to stimulate the economy.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Because then you get a keynesian free market multiplier effect to boost your GNP up the supply side of the curve.
>>> The President asks, <<<
Are you POSITIVE that dogs can vote?
>>>  Dogbert thinks, <<<
Now, r-e-e-l him in . . .

You're going to be an economic advisor to the President?  What do you know about economics?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
It's simple, Bob.
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
The country needs to give all the money to dogs, thus stimulating the economy.
>>> Bob asks, <<<
Why can't we spend the money ourselves?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
You'd probably fritter it away on food and health care.

I'll have to come up with tons of compliments or I'll seem shallow.

This is the most beautiful baby in the universe.  Looks just like you.  She should be a model.

Wait . . . This picture looks different.  Did you have two babies?

The first picture was our pug dog, Winston.  It got in there by mistake.

I hope that little misunderstanding won't detract from the perceived sincerity of the following compliments . . .

Actually, I'm as dumb as toast.

We can prattle about your inadequacies later.
>>> Dogbert says as he fills out the form, <<<
I'll do your taxes and talk at the same time so you really feel dumb.

According to this, you owe your tax preparer an additional two thousand dollars.

See . . It was a pat, not a pet.  Like this . . .

Oh look, it's 'Garfield,' your favorite . . .

Just as I suspected - you stopped to pet the neighbor's cat!

It meant nothing.  It was more of a pat than a pet.

Save your lies for the trial.
>>> 
1992-03-08 * 
Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
I'm joining a manly drum beating group.

>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Well, see, this poet Robert Bly wrote a book about being a manly warrior . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I haven't actually read the book . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
. . . But it has something to do with beating drums and rejecting your mother.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Let me get this straight . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
. . . You're taking advice from a POET on how to be manly?
>>> Dilbert and three men stand around holding drums.  A man asks Dilbert, <<<

That isn't fair.

Dogbert!

>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Weren't they slave owners?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Well . . . Sure, but at least it was democratic.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Back then, the only people allowed to vote were white male land owners.

La la la la la la la la.

Ruebert the Robot says to Dilbert, <<<
My mate is complete!  I will now have eons of marital bliss!

I'm in hell.

A woman with a huge nose tells Dilbert and Wally, <<<
I've decided to have plastic surgery.

Maybe then nobody will call you 'Toucan Sam' behind your back in the cafeteria every day.
>>> Wally says, <<<
Ooh, and remember when the summer intern left?

The joke was 'Maybe Janet accidentally snorted him up her nose.'

Global warming?

Cows are destroying the earth?

They're better organized than you'd think.
>>> 
1992-02-14 * 
Dogbert says to the robot, <<<
We need to do something about your total lack of ethics and social conscience.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I had Dilbert build this guilt module for your control board.  It has the synthesized shame of every major belief system.
>>> Later, the robot says to Dilbert, <<<
I am unworthy to roll in your spittle.
>>>  Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
Frankly, I liked him better before.
>>> 
1992-02-13 * 
Dogbert says to the garbage man, <<<
Our robot is taunting Dilbert mercilessly.  Is there any way to stop him?
>>> The garbage man says, <<<
I meant to tell you; I calibrated his neuro-actuator so he would obey only YOUR commands, Dogbert.

Hmm . . . A perfectly good robot.  Probably just needs a neurospectrum field calibration.

Hey!  Guess who's WAY smarter than you!

Now they're removing the squiggly thing!

Wait . . . This might be the wrong tape . . . I think this is your appendectomy video.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Either that or little Timmy isn't very photogenic.
>>> 
1992-02-08 * 
Dogbert and Dilbert sit outdoors.  Dilbert says, <<<
Evolution must be true because it is a logical conclusion of the scientific method.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
But science is based on the irrational belief that because we cannot perceive reality all at once, things called 'time' and 'cause and effect' exist.
>>> Dilbert says angrily, <<<
That's what I was taught and that's what I believe.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Sounds cultish.

A man with a large head says to Dilbert, <<<
Since this is the first time you've been to a Mensa meeting, I'll explain a few things.

To be honest, I think a lot of it is just random.

Hi.  I'm here for my first Mensa meeting of geniuses.

A man with a large head says to Dilbert, <<<
You seem like a bright fellow; have you considered joining Mensa?
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Is that the group with genius IQs?
>>>  The man replies, <<<
Precisely correct.  I'm president of the local chapter.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
If we're so smart, why do we work here?
>>>  The man replies, <<<
Intelligence has much less practical application than you'd think.

Carol, If you have any suggestions on my report, let me know.

What kind of ridiculous tripe are you pushing??
>>> Carol says, <<<
I spit on your report!
>>> Carol lights a match and says, <<<
I should burn it to ashes, but I won't . . .
>>> Carol cries, <<<
Because I'd rather dance on your grave after people read this!
>>>  She laughs. Carol throws the document at Dilbert and says, <<<
Crawl back into your hole, you fly-infested bucket of dead carp!!
>>> Dilbert walks away as Carol shouts, <<<
Die!  Die!  Die!
>>> Dilbert tells Wally, <<<
Next time I'm just gonna say 'Carol, make some copies.'"  Wally says, <<<
The secretaries here have way too much power.
>>>

Dogbert stands on a stage holding a microphone and saying, <<<
Swing your partner, dosey-do.  Now clap your hands . . .

I was skeptical about hiring a dog as our new square-dance caller, but your resume is impressive.
>>> The man continues, <<<
I didn't even know you could win a Pulitzer Prize for square-dance calling.
>>> The man continues, <<<
Wow!  And you're already in the Alberdeen Hall of Dung!
>>> 
1992-01-30 * 
Wally asks Dilbert, <<<
How's the new guy doing?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
He's extremely productive.
>>> Dilbert says as they watch a man at a desk wildly tossing documents over his shoulder, <<<
We think he's one of those bureaucracy savants.

Occupation?

Dilbert stands in front of an empty fishbowl with his arms on his hips.  Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
You expect me to believe that Goldie flushed HIMSELF down the john??!

Surely you don't believe that I ended his ugly, stupid fish life in a fit of pet rivalry . . .
>>> Dilbert looks at a small piece of paper and says, <<<
Explain how a fish can write a suicide note.

I hope Dogbert doesn't get jealous of my new goldfish.

Have you noticed that Goldie was looking a bit depressed?
>>> 
1992-01-26 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
I have a solution for your dating dilemma.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
At your age there are more single men than single women.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Worse yet, all of the single women are dating married men or serial killers.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
But the statistics eventually favor men.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Really?  How?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
At age 80 there are THREE TIMES as many available women as men because men die younger.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Are you saying I should wait until I'm old . . . And date 80-year-old women?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
No.  I wouldn't wait . . .
>>> 
1992-01-25 * 
Dilbert's clothes are disheveled and he has lipstick marks all over his head.  Dogbert asks, <<<
What happened to you?

Kitty Kelly was here to write your biography.  She was all over me.  I think she took my watch.

I never trust anybody named 'Kitty.'"  Dilbert says as he walks away, <<<
I think I love her.

1992-01-23 * 
Ratbert and Dogbert walk outdoors.  Dogbert says, <<<
I thought you were my friend, Ratbert.  Why did you tip off the authorities about my insider stock trading?
>>> Ratbert replies, <<<
I was afraid that if you kept the money you would leave and I'd never see you again.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Really?  Gee . . .
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Did they give you a reward?
>>>  Ratbert replies, <<<
Yeah, I'm outta here!
>>> 
1992-01-22 * 
Dogbert says to Dilbert, Ratbert, and Bob and Dawn the Dinosaurs, <<<
Thank you all for coming.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I called this house meeting because somebody tipped off the authorities about my insider stock trading.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Somebody in this room is a rat.
>>>  Ratbert looks worried as he asks, <<<
Figuratively speaking?
>>> 
1992-01-21 * 
Dogbert stands at a desk and works on a computer as Dilbert watches from behind.  Dogbert says, <<<
I can execute my stock transactions on-line with the PC.
>>> Dogbert stops typing and says, <<<
There . . . My insider trading netted another sixty million dollars.
>>>  Dilbert shakes his finger at Dogbert and says, <<<
Bad dog!

I suppose it's too late to try slapping him with a rolled-up newspaper.

Dilbert sits in his chair reading the newspaper and Dogbert stands on the hassock.  Dogbert says, <<<
I've decided to become an inside trader of stocks.

Inside trading is illegal.  Besides, where will you get your information?

Shhh . . . I hear a board meeting starting San Francisco.
>>> 
1992-01-19 * 
Dilbert and his uncle sit at a table eating dinner.  Dilbert says, <<<
Uncle Ned, can we see your hunting trophies after dinner?
>>> Dilbert looks at a mounted bear head and says, <<<
Oooh . . .
>>>  Ned says, <<<
I bagged this one at the zoo.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The zoo?  That's illegal.
>>>  Ned replies, <<<
No wonder everybody got so excited.
>>> Ned shows Dilbert some other plaques and says, <<<
These are some doves I killed with the help of my loyal dog, Rusty.
>>> They walk past a mounted dog and Ned says, <<<
That's Rusty.  We ran out of doves . . .
>>> They look at the heads of a man, woman and cat.  Ned says, <<<
These were my neighbors - Florence, Dave and Muffin.
>>> Dilbert carries Dogbert under his arm and says, <<<
Hey, look at the time!  Got to run!
>>>  Ned asks, <<<
Don't you want to see my 'Hall-O'-Postal Employees'?

New rule: Find out their hobbies before you eat their pot roast.

We should have stayed for the 'Hall-O'-Postal Employees.'
>>> 
1992-01-18 * 
A prisoner whispers to another prisoner, <<<
Pssst . . . I'm planning an escape.
>>> The man continues, <<<
I've secretly built a ladder out of dental floss.
>>> The other man replies, <<<
Ha!  And they say the rich aren't clever.
>>> 
1992-01-17 * 
Dogbert uses a megaphone to address several men in bathrobes and slippers.  Dogbert says, <<<
Attention, prisoners!  This is Warden Dogbert speaking!
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
My jail has not been profitable.  I've decided to have you all executed to reduce operating costs.
>>> Dogbert walks away thinking, <<<
The 'Joke of the Day' program seems wasted on these people.
>>> 
1992-01-16 * 
Dogbert stands on a bookcase and says to the men below, <<<
Dogbert's Jail for the Rich and Famous aims to satisfy all of your prison needs.
>>> A man asks, <<<
Could you arrange to have my lawyer killed?
>>> The man continues, <<<
He snores.
>>>  Another man in the crowd says, <<<
Do not.
>>> 
1992-01-15 * 
A man wearing a robe and holding a wine glass asks Dilbert, <<<
What are you in for?
>>>  Dilbert says angrily, <<<
I live here!

This is my house!  My dog turned it into a jail-for-profit without my permission!

Man, you're the wrong guy to talk to during 'happy hour.'

Checking in.

I guess you've learned your lesson.

Whoa!  Looks like my jail term is almost over!
>>> 
1992-01-13 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert stands on the hassock.  Dogbert says, <<<
I've decided to go into the private jail business.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I figure it's a good way to meet celebrities.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Where's it going to be?
>>> A man carrying a briefcase enters and says, <<<
You call this dump a prison?
>>>  Dogbert says to Dilbert, <<<
I probably should have mentioned this sooner.
>>> 
1992-01-12 * 
Ratbert tells Dogbert, <<<
The great thing about this country is that we have freedom of speech!
>>> Ratbert asks, <<<
Is it okay to say that?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Hmm . . . Let's see if it's on the free speech checklist . . .
>>> Dogbert reads a document and says, <<<
Okay, you didn't advocate overthrowing the government . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
You were not obscene . . . You did not generalize about a disadvantaged group . . . You did not teach children anything useful or practical . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
You didn't refer to anybody who can afford a lawyer to sue us . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
And there's nobody within hearing distance who can harm you financially . . . You're clear.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
God bless this country!

Whoa!  Whoa!

No.

Oh, then we'll call back later.

Dilbert, the Boss and two people sit at a conference table.  Dilbert says, <<<
I don't know why we even bother holding meetings on Friday afternoons . . .

Hmm . . . Productive? . . . Hmm . . .

I'm too late.
>>> 
1992-01-09 *

Snack time, Dilbert!  I brought you an apple so you will like me!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Nice try, Ratbert, but I don't want to eat something that was touched by a rat.
>>> Ratbert says sadly, <<<
The worst part is that's why I didn't eat it myself.
>>> 
1992-01-08 * 
Dilbert lies in bed thinking, <<<
Why should I get up today?  What is my purpose in life?
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I'm hungry.  A toasted bagel would taste great.
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the table eating breakfast.  Dilbert says, <<<
Maybe the purpose of life is eating bagels.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
You shouldn't try to think on an empty stomach.

Thanks.  I feel a lot better.

Doggie-Bert!
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Sit down, Bret.
>>> Dogbert and the infant sit on the floor.  Dogbert says, <<<
You're in your most innocent and impressionable years.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
As an adult, it is my duty to fill your sponge-like brain with incredible nonsense for my own entertainment.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Your parents are really space aliens.
>>>  The baby looks frightened. Dogbert continues, <<<
They're just fattening you up so they can eat you!
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
The slaughterhouse is a place they call kindergarten!!
>>> The father hands Dogbert his money and says, <<<
Thanks, Dogbert.  Did you change him?

Probably.

Wouldn't it be funny if I just slapped your pointy hats flat?

I cannot believe what passes for funny around here.
>>> 
1992-01-02 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
Ratbert, I want you to wear a disguise and infiltrate the elf gang that has been bothering us.
>>>  Ratbert replies, <<<
Check.
>>> An elf says to Ratbert who is wearing an elf hat and clothing, <<<
We haven't seen you before . . . <<<
  Another elf asks, <<<
What's the secret handshake?
>>> Ratbert bends over and waves his arms.  The elf says, <<<
No, but that's one heckuva good guess.
>>> 
1992-01-01 * 
An elf says to three other elves, <<<
The humans are not afraid of our elf magic.  We must gain their respect through verbal intimidation.
>>> Dilbert sits at a table with a box of donuts and a glass of milk in front of him.  The elves shout, <<<
Hey, Bozo!  We're talking to you, Chubby!
>>> The elves walk away with donuts around their bodies.  An elf says, <<<

Shut up.

An elf holding a top hat says to Dogbert, <<<
Fear us, dog!  We elves are magic.  Watch this!

1991-12-30 * 
An elf says to three other elves, <<<
I say we elves have been pushed around too long!
>>> The elf says, <<<
Let's use our elf magic to conquer the world!!

Yeah!  Elf magic!

I'll take the forty-three of clubs.
>>> 
1991-12-29 * 
Dilbert stands at the front of a conference room.  He says, <<<
I've been asked to brief everybody on the company's policy for protecting secret information.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
All secret information must be locked up at night.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Our secrets could be of great value to our competitors.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
In fact, some companies try to buy the secrets of their competitors.
>>> A woman asks, <<<
Just out of curiosity, how much would our competitors pay for our secrets?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Oh, I dunno . . . Maybe several times your annual salary.
>>> The people at the table smirk at each other.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
I don't think this was some of my best work.
>>> 
1991-12-28 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit outdoors.  Dilbert asks, <<<
Do you ever wonder about the meaning of life, Dogbert?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I used to.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
But I looked it up in the dictionary under 'L' and there it was - the meaning of life.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
It was less than I expected.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Did you try the thesaurus?
>>> 
1991-12-27 * 
Dilbert and a woman sit at a table in a restaurant.  The woman says, <<<
I'm using a new system for evaluating my dates.  I just check off boxes on this card throughout the night.
>>> The woman continues, <<<
There . . . I just dinged you a point for that nervous twitch.
>>> The woman asks, <<<
Would you say your head is more like a block or a bucket?
>>> 
1991-12-26 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk and asks, <<<
What did you mean when you said all employees are empowered?
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Does that mean I can control my own budget, make decisions without twelve levels of approval, and take calculated risks on my own?
>>> The Boss replies, <<<
No, it's just a way to blame employees for not doing the things we tell them not to do.
>>>  Dilbert hangs his head and says, <<<
No wonder you needed a new word.
>>> 
1991-12-25 * 
Dilbert holds a device and says to Dogbert, <<<
I invented an auto-petter machine for you.
>>> Dilbert straps the machine to Dogbert's back.  The auto-petter has a hand that rests on Dogbert's head.  Dogbert says, <<<
This is perhaps your dumbest idea ever.
>>> Dilbert starts the device and kneels on the floor in front of Dogbert.  Dilbert says, <<<
You like it.  Admit it.

Leave us alone.
>>> 
1991-12-24 *

The Boss says to Dilbert, Wally and another employee, <<<
From now on, all employees are empowered to make their own decisions.

No, YOU are!

I'll never work hard again!

Take it like a man.
>>> 
1991-12-20 * 
Wally says to Dilbert, <<<
Uh-oh, Nardo is coming.  I'm out of here.
>>> Nardo and Dilbert stand nose-to-nose.  Dilbert says, <<<
Uh, hi, Nardo.
>>>  Nardo says, <<<
In the old country we did not have what you call personal space.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Take your hands out of my pockets.
>>>  Nardo says, <<<
Oh, I get it.  They're for your use only, right?
>>> 
1991-12-19 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair reading the newspaper and Dogbert stands on the hassock.  Dogbert says, <<<
I've become a newspaper critic.

Of what?

I criticize ordinary people . . . I started with you.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Hey, here it is . . .

If you build it, they will come.

A voice . . .

If you build it, they will come.

Dilbert says, <<<
Dogbert, I got tiny 'PCS' phones for both of us.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
It's the newest technology!  I'll be able to call you at any time, no matter where we are!
>>> The phone sits on the pillow next to Dogbert.  As it rings, Dogbert thinks, <<<
Why must all progress start out as something annoying?
>>> 
1991-12-15 * 
Dogbert sits on his pillow.  Dilbert enters the room holding a dust mop.  He tells Dogbert, <<<
I'm going to dust.
>>>  Dogbert's ears fly up. Dogbert runs out of the room. Dilbert dusts a table. Dilbert dusts a lamp.  Clouds of dust begin to rise. Dilbert dusts a picture and the dust clouds get bigger. A cloud of dust fills the room. Dilbert thinks, <<<
I'm starting to think there's a trick to this.

Did your mother teach you to dust that way?

We didn't call her the 'Grey Fox' because of her clever brownie recipe.
>>>

Dilbert sits at his desk working on his computer and Dogbert sits next to him.  Dilbert says, <<<
Knowledge is power, Dogbert.

Secretaries.

1991-12-13 * 
Dilbert asks a pregnant woman, <<<
When's the baby due?

Baby?  What baby?
>>> The woman continues, <<<
Can't a woman go off her diet for one day without getting that question??
>>>  Beads of sweat fly off Dilbert's forehead. The woman thinks, <<<
Next . . .

So, when's the baby due?
>>>

It is my destiny to conquer Elbonia using Dilbert's hover-saucer invention.

Maybe I shouldn't drive while under the influence of metaphors.

Try it; it'll make you feel like a man for the first time!

How about Brenda?

Darn, now my eyes are stuck in zombie mode . . .

1991-09-22 * 
Dogbert walks in the park. A fish with legs comes walking down the path.  The fish says, <<<
Howdy!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I've never seen a fish with legs.
>>>  The fish explains, <<<
I'm evolving into a higher life form.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
That sounds like a lot of work.
>>> The fish says, <<<
Yeah . . . The hard part is finding a mate who isn't turned off by legs.

With any luck, the kids will be mutants too.

I'm hoping they'll have arms but not look too much like Rodney Dangerfield.

Oh, that's original.

Dogbert sits on a park bench next to a muscular man.  The large man says, <<<
It's not easy to be a professional body builder.

How's the pay?
>>>  The man asks, <<<
Pay?

Dilbert sits at a conference table with several people.  The man next to him whispers, <<<
What's your presentation going to be about?

Wyoming: one of the many rectangular states.

Next on 'America's Most Wanted.'

The victims were wedgied in their own homes, usually while watching this show.

Can you lean over and adjust that picture?

Sure.

They don't even explain what a wedgie is.

Yes?

I came to find out if the news on television is all faked by your special effects company.

I knew that.
>>> 
1991-09-10 * 
Dogbert asks Dilbert, <<<
Seriously, how do we know the news isn't all faked??

Why is there exactly thirty minutes of world news every night?  And why don't major stories ever happen on weekends?
>>> Dogbert points at the tv and says, <<<
And I'm sure I see a string attached to the space shuttle.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Worse yet, it's a rerun.
>>> 
1991-09-08 *

Everybody take a copy of the agenda.

I'm in the wrong meeting . . . Now it's too awkward to leave.

Ouch!

Oh, sorry, wrong agenda.

You just start with a chunk of marble and remove everything that doesn't look like an elephant.
>>> Later, Dilbert stares at the chips of marble that remain on the stand.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Apparently, this chunk of marble didn't have an elephant in it.
>>>

A caption identifies a young man as a <<<
worried teenager.

>>> Dogbert yells, <<<
Pimple attack!

Does it leave a big hickey?
>>> 
1991-09-02 * 
The Boss points to a man whose mouth is a sucking disc and says to Dilbert, <<<
Dilbert, this is your new co-worker, Floyd Remora.

Go ahead . . . Ask me how my day went.

Hey, that's Lisa.  I dated her last night!
>>> Dilbert walks outside and says, <<<
Lisa!  What are you doing in this neighborhood!
>>> Lisa looks guilty and replies, <<<
Well . . . Actually, I didn't know how to tell you to stop calling me . . .
>>> Lisa continues, <<<
. . . So I came to throw this brick with a note on it through your window.
>>> Lisa throws the brick and it crashes through the window.  She says, <<<
It seems awkward now . . .
>>> Dilbert reads the note on the brick, <<<
. . . It was like you sucked the oxygen out of the room . . . You remind me of fungus . . .
>>> Dilbert reads, <<<
. . . Continued on brick two.

That's it!  She is OFF my Valentine list!!

On different nights?
>>> 
1991-08-29 * 
Dilbert says to a short man, <<<
Hi, Les.
>>>  Les says, <<<
You say that almost mockingly.

The way you say it, my name sounds like 'Less.'  I've told you a million times it's French -- pronounced 'Lez.'
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You seem a little short-tempered.
>>>  Les says, <<<
Hey!  That time you did it on purpose!!
>>> 
1991-08-28 * 
Dilbert and some co-workers sit at a conference table.  A tiny man says to Dilbert, <<<
I disagree with everything you said.  Who wants to step outside and fight about it?!!!
>>> The little man says, <<<
I may be on the smallish side but I can kick any butt in this room!!
>>> The short man continues, <<<
C'mon, who wants a piece of me??!

It's my fault.  I accidentally used him to soak up a coffee spill this morning.

Yes, sir.

Get a life.

I'll take this one.

Now that you own a senator, what are you going to do with him?

He'll appreciate in value when a close vote comes up in the Senate.  Then I'll sell him to a political action committee.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
This is starting to affect my blind faith in the system.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<

Dogbert opens the door and a man in a suit says, <<<
I'm from the government.  We're repaying insured depositors who lost money in 'Ethel's S $ L.'
>>> The man continues, <<<
We're a little short on cash ourselves, so we're divvying up the items Ethel bought.
>>> Dogbert holds a man's hand and says to Dilbert, <<<
I got a senator.

Wow!  Are you kidding?  I'd be honored!  I've always aspired to be a flunky!

I'll start by tongue-washing the windows!

I don't see how rich people ever get bored.

Well, Mr. Dogbert, what could I do to convince you to put your new wealth in our bank?

Stretch your polyester pants over the top of your head.

I hope money doesn't change me.

1991-08-18 *

Come help me hook up my new VCR, Dogbert.

You read the instructions and I'll connect the cables.
>>> Dogbert reads, <<<
'Connect the 300 Ohm twin-lead flat cable to the 75 Ohm RF2 jack.'
>>> Dilbert looks confused.  Dogbert continues to read, <<<
'Or use the optional 75 Ohm co-axial cable with the F type connector.'
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Good Lord, I'm an electrical engineer and I don't understand any of this.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I'll have to lie to the other engineers and say I don't WANT to record tv shows.
>>> Dogbert reads, <<<
'Now, strip naked, cover your body with motor oil and run through town yelling walla-walla-walla.'
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Let me see that.
>>>  Dogbert reads, <<<
'Step six: Do not doubt the nice dog.'
>>> 
1991-08-17 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on the hassock.  Dogbert says, <<<
I quit my job as a used car salesman.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Because you couldn't keep lying?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
No, the lying was good.  I liked that part.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Was it because crime doesn't pay?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I made $400,000 this week.  I'm retired now.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I don't think this will ever be a 'Reader's Digest' very special story.
>>> 
1991-08-16 * 
Dogbert points to a car and says to a customer, <<<
How about this one?
>>> The man says, <<<
I don't want to spend much.  I'm only going to take it apart and leave it on the lawn.
>>> The man says, <<<
I gotta be me.
>>> 
1991-08-15 * 
Dogbert says to a customer, <<<
I asked the boss to sell it at your price.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
He told me to drive over your foot and steal your purse.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Buy maybe I can convince him to take your first-born son instead.
>>>  The woman says, <<<
He IS my first-born son!!
>>> 
1991-08-14 * 
Dogbert asks a customer, <<<
Will this be your first car, Timmy?
>>> Timmy replies, <<<
Yes, sir . . . I saved my money from mowing lawns.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Let's see how much you have and then I'll pick a car for you.
>>> As he counts Timmy's money, Dogbert asks, <<<
Do you like mowing lawns, Timmy?

It's okay.

Good, because I don't recommend med school for you.

Three thousand.

No, but I could sell THAT car for four thousand.
>>>  The man says, <<<
Thirty-five hundred.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Sold.

I guess you don't get a lot of negotiators like me.

It's the first time anybody bought the car they came here in.
>>> 
1991-08-12 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert stands on the hassock.  Dogbert says, <<<
I got a job as a used car salesman.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Does it pay well?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I'm not in it for the money.  I just enjoy lying to strangers.
>>> Dogbert shows a car to a customer and says, <<<
This one was owned by Carlos the Diamond Smuggler.  It corners well, but the gas mileage is bad -- almost as if it has weights hidden in the door panels.
>>> 
1991-08-11 * 
Dilbert drives his car and thinks, <<<
Motorist in distress up ahead.
>>> A woman in a car asks, <<<
Can you help me, young man?

Hmm . . . Yes, I see . . . Try it now.
>>> The woman tries to start the car and says, <<<
Nothing.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Okay, try it now.
>>>  The woman gets out of the car and looks over his shoulder. The woman says, <<<
Hey, you're not doing anything but fiddling and poking at things!
>>> The woman continues, <<<
In fact, there's nothing in here that you could conceivably fix with your bare hands.  My God, you men are frauds!!
>>> The woman continues, <<<
It's lucky I'm out of gas; you might have caused an explosion!!
>>> 
1991-08-10 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair thinking, <<<
I hate it when my dog just stares at me.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Is he plotting?  Does hoe know something I don't?  What is it?
>>> Dogbert looks at Dilbert through a pair of binoculars.  Dogbert thinks, <<<
Dogs don't like to talk about it, but the instinct to look up people's noses is very strong.
>>> 
1991-08-09 * 
Dilbert and three men sit at a table eating lunch.  A man says, <<<
Yeah . . . I had a temperature of 147 degrees and they had to remove my internal organs.

Well, that's nothing compared to my bout with bubonic plague last week.

Did I ever tell you about the time I repaired my own lawn mower?
>>>  Another man thinks, <<<
Not again.
>>> 
1991-08-08 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the table.  Dilbert says as assembles a device, <<<
I'm obsessed with inventing a perpetual motion device.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Most scientists think it's impossible, but I have something they don't.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
A lot of spare time?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Exactly.
>>> 
1991-08-07 * 
Alice, Dilbert and a man sit at a table eating lunch.  Alice is holding a baby in her arms.  The Boss enters and says, <<<
Alice, I've been thinking . . . Since your baby was born in the office, have you considered naming it after your boss?
>>> Alice replies, <<<
As a matter of fact, I DID name him after you.
>>> As the Boss walks away, Alice says, <<<
Want some more milk, 'Butt Head?'
>>> 
1991-08-06 * 
The Boss sits at his desk and says, <<<
Alice, I noticed you gave birth by the Xerox machine this morning . . .
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
We don't have a maternity leave policy here, but if you need some time, I'm sure we can find somebody less fertile to fill your job.
>>> Alice replies, <<<
Thank you, sir, but I don't expect any special treatment.
>>>  Alice is breast feeding a baby under her shirt. 
1991-08-05 * 
Dilbert asks Alice, who is pregnant, <<<
When's the baby due?
>>>  Alice replies, <<<
Any minute now.
>>> Alice continues, <<<
This company has no maternity leave policy, so I'm going to deliver by the Xerox machine and keep working.
>>> Dilbert says to a man, <<<
That doesn't seem fair.
>>>  The man replies, <<<
Yeah, especially if you need to make copies.
>>> 
1991-08-04 * 
A woman holding a cocktail glass says to another woman, <<<
Uh-oh . . . That guy is coming to talk to us.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I hate this long walk across the room.
>>> The woman says, <<<
You're the ugly one, Edna.  You'll have to protect me.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
They spotted me.  They're planning a defense.
>>> The woman says to Edna, <<<
I'll push you between us.  You start babbling about your cat or something.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I can't do it.  I'll veer off at the last minute . . .
>>> The woman shouts, <<<
Now, Edna!
>>>  and pushes her.  Edna falls and Dilbert trips over her. The woman thinks, <<<
It's hard to be the pretty one.
>>>  From the floor, Edna says, <<<
I have a cat named Boots.
>>> 
1991-08-03 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I feel like I'm being judged by everybody I see.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Why can't people accept other people as they are, without judging them?
>>> Dogbert holds up a card with the score <<<
7.5" written on it.  Dogbert says, <<<
It was a good speech, but it lacked emotion.
>>>

>>> 
1991-07-30 * 
Dogbert sits across from a desk and says, <<<
I've decided to become a pop psychologist.  I need your help to make my lecture video.
>>> A man in sunglasses replies, <<<
You came to the right place, babe.  First, you need a new look.
>>> Dogbert is wearing a pony tail of false hair and a pointed brassiere.  Dogbert says, <<<
Nice try, but frankly, this look didn't work too well for Madonna either.
>>> 
1991-07-29 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert stands on the hassock.  Dogbert says, <<<
I've decided to become a pop psychologist and lecturer.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
My theory is that you can blame all of your problems on invisible people.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
That doesn't sound healthy.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Don't blame me.  Talk to Juan and Cindy.
>>> 
1991-07-28 * 
The sign over Dogbert's desk reads, <<<
Dogbert's Find-A-Friend Service.
>>> A man says, <<<
I'd like to find a friend.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Have a seat.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I need to ask a few questions, so I don't accidentally match you with somebody who's too good for you.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
One: When a friend doesn't return a borrowed tool, do you?  a: Make sarcastic comments; b: buy a new tool; c: set a lethal trap.
>>> The man answers, <<<
C: Set a lethal trap.
>>> Later, Dogbert reads the results of the test and says, <<<
I'm afraid you haven't qualified for a normal friend . . . I could set you up with somebody who's new in town, but it wouldn't last.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
There's one option . . . Two, if you count growing sea monkeys.
>>> The man stands at Dilbert's door.  Dilbert says, <<<
Yes, I hate sea monkeys too.  Who are you?
>>> 
1991-07-27 * 
Dilbert walks down the office hallway and thinks, <<<
Forgot my keys.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I'll have to slap my forehead and mutter when I turn around, otherwise I'll look silly.
>>> As two people watch, Dilbert smacks himself and his glasses fly off his head.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Too hard.
>>> 
1991-07-26 * 
Bob the Dinosaur asks Dogbert, <<<
Will you sign my petition?
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
What's it for, Bob?
>>> Bob replies, <<<
I didn't have any complaints, so it just says 'D-uhh.

Democracy is a wonderful thing.

1991-07-25 * 
Dogbert asks Dilbert, <<<
How did you do in the stand-up comedy competition?

I was halfway through my first joke -- about old people, when an elderly woman dragged me off stage and slapped the bejeezus out of me.
>>> Dilbert holds up a trophy and says, <<<
. . . It was good enough for third place.
>>> 
1991-07-24 * 
A comedian asks Dilbert, <<<
Is this your first time?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Yeah.

I know I'm supposed to be your competitor, but I'll share my technique of using mental imagery to relax.

Thanks!

Imagine that you're naked . . . And the audience is full of Mary Kay salespeople with camcorders . . .
>>> 
1991-07-23 * 
Dogbert and Dilbert sit at a table.  Dogbert asks, <<<
What makes you think you can win the stand-up comedy competition?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
It's just a matter of writing good jokes.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Here's one - - 'Why do women go to the restroom in pairs?'"  Dogbert asks, <<<
Why?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Because they're stapled to the chicken!  Hee-hee!
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
It's been nice knowing you.
>>> 
1991-07-22 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I've decided to enter the stand-up comedy competition next week.
>>> Dilbert reads a document and continues, <<<
The rules seem pretty straightforward . . . Five minutes per person . . . The first minute is freestyle comedy.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
The remaining time is for the mandatory categories: Dan Quayle, flatulence, and the warning labels on mattresses.
>>> 
1991-07-21 * 
Dilbert drives his car.  He hears a siren behind him and thinks, <<<
Police?
>>> The officer stands at Dilbert's window and says, <<<
You made an illegal U-turn.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You're giving me a ticket for THAT?!  A measly U-turn?!
>>> Dilbert says angrily, <<<
I can't believe it!  The world is full of murderers and thugs, but you stop ME?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm wasting my taxes on your salary!
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
And frankly, those mustaches you guys all grow don't make you look any smarter.
>>> The policeman says, <<<
Please step out of your car for the sobriety test.
>>> Dilbert arrives at home wearing dirty and torn clothing.  He tells Dogbert, <<<
. . . So, it turns out that the sobriety test involves flinging yourself down a muddy embankment.
>>> 
1991-07-20 * 
Dogbert sees Ratbert lying on the sidewalk.  Dogbert says, <<<
Ratbert!  What happened to you?
>>> Ratbert sits up and replies, <<<
My Chihuahua disguise worked.  I've been taunted and chased all day by bigots who hate Chihuahuas for no reason.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
There's an important lesson in this.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
What?  Chihuahuas are evil?
>>> 
1991-07-19 * 
A boy walks toward Ratbert and says, <<<
Hey, aren't you one of those Chihuahua dogs?
>>>  Ratbert thinks, <<<
The disguise is working.
>>> The boy says, <<<
Unless . . . Maybe you're just a rat in a turtleneck sweater pretending to be a Chihuahua.
>>>  Ratbert thinks, <<<
Think fast.
>>> The boy walks away saying, <<<
I don't have the attention span to think about it.
>>>  Ratbert thinks, <<<
What did he mean by 'just a rat?'
>>> 
1991-07-18 * 
Ratbert sits on a rock writing in his journal.  Ratbert writes, <<<
Day one: I have disguised myself as a Chihuahua so I can experience their lifestyle and make a movie.
>>> Ratbert writes, <<<
I have already seen the senseless prejudice and brutality against an innocent Chihuahua.
>>> Ratbert writes, <<<
This morning I slapped myself with a rolled up newspaper for no apparent reason.  It was strangely satisfying.
>>> 
1991-07-17 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
Your Chihuahua disguise is good, Ratbert, but you must also learn to THINK like a Chihuahua.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
To think like a Chihuahua, imagine the sound of one hand clapping.
>>> Ratbert yells, <<<
Ouch!  I sprained my brain!  Yip yip yip yip yip!!!
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Good, good . . .
>>> 
1991-07-16 * 
Ratbert, who is wearing a sweater, asks Dogbert, <<<
What do you think of my Chihuahua disguise?!
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
It's a good start, Ratbert, but it takes more than a turtleneck to look like a Chihuahua.
>>> Ratbert opens his eyes wide and says, <<<
How about if I make this face and act nervous?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Perfect.
>>> 
1991-07-15 * 
Dogbert sits on his pillow.  Ratbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I'm going to disguise myself as a Chihuahua for a week.
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
Then I'll make a movie about prejudice against Chihuahuas!!
>>> Ratbert continues, <<<
When I win an Oscar, I'll turn it down and say 'This is for my brothers, the proud Chihuahuas.'"  Dogbert says, <<<
Go away.
>>> 
1991-07-14 * 
Dilbert watches Dogbert sleeping on the hassock.  He thinks, <<<
Why do dogs twitch their feet when they sleep?
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
It's so cute.  They must be dreaming about chasing cars.
>>> In Dogbert's dream, he stands on a throne and says, <<<
Ha ha!  I am Saint Dogbert!  Line up to kiss my feet, you knaves!
>>> Saint Dogbert asks Dilbert, <<<
What's on my schedule today, lackey?
>>> Dilbert looks at the schedule and says, <<<
You'll be pushing whiney, ugly people into mud at nine.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Then, you'll tease cats about their grooming methods until ten.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Good, good.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Then you'll raise taxes, go to lunch, and take the rest of the day off.
>>> Dogbert wakes up and thinks, <<<
Reality: what a gyp.
>>> 
1991-07-13 * 
Dilbert shows Dogbert a mud flap and says, <<<
I bought some mud flaps with the silhouette of a naked woman.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
With these on my car, women will think I'm a sexist Neanderthal, and men will be embarrassed to share my gender.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But now I'm having second thoughts.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
That implies you had first thoughts.
>>> 
1991-07-12 * 
Dilbert lies on a couch and a psychologist sits next to him taking notes on a pad of paper.  Dilbert says, <<<
I can't stop putting writing tools in my shirt pocket . . .

It started harmlessly . . . First a pen, then two.  Now I'm afraid to go anywhere without a pen and pencil of every color.
>>> The psychiatrist asks, <<<
Do you have the secondary colors?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
There are SECONDARY colors?!
>>> 
1991-07-11 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Who would win if a giant moth fought a giant but modest bee in an all-wool jumpsuit?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Wait . . . Who's wearing the jumpsuit -- the giant moth or the giant bee?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
The bee.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Is this just hypothetical?
>>> 
1991-07-10 * 
A man stands behind a counter.  The sign behind the clerk says, <<<
Fred's Driving School: learn to drive in just five minutes.
>>> Dogbert approaches the counter and asks, <<<
How can you teach driving in just five minutes?

It's a crash course.
>>> 
1991-07-09 * 
Dilbert says to Wally, <<<
I just read that in a few years you will be able to access all of the news and information of the world from your personal computer.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
You probably saw the same article in today's paper.

I don't read a paper.
>>> Dilbert thinks as he walks away, <<<
What's wrong with this picture?
>>> 
1991-07-08 *

Dogbert and Dilbert walk through the park.  Dilbert asks, <<<
Do you think people are basically good or evil?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Well, I know dogs are basically good.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
And dogs are better than people.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
But people are better than cats.
>>> They sit down under a tree.  Dogbert continues, <<<
And cats are evil . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Therefore, all people are stupid.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I don't follow that logic.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Yes, my theory predicts you would say that.
>>> 
1991-07-06 * 
Dogbert sits on a pillow watching tv.  He thinks, <<<
The more I watch television, the more I wonder why I'm not already supreme ruler of earth.
>>> Dogbert walks away thinking, <<<
Those people are idiots.  They should all drive over here and proclaim me their king.
>>> Dogbert returns to the pillow with a bag of potato chips and thinks, <<<
The secret to happiness is high expectations and your own bag of chips.
>>> 
1991-07-05 * 
Dogbert sits on a park bench next to a chef.  The chef says, <<<
I haven't been able to get a job in two years.
>>> The chef continues, <<<
It's because everybody knows my brother is in jail.  People think I must be dishonest too.
>>> The chef concludes, <<<
You should not judge a cook by its brother.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
He probably says the same about you.
>>> 
1991-07-04 *

I call my garbage man to the stand, because he knows everything.

According to the Iowa Corn Treaty of 1837, it is LEGAL to kill a man with an ear of corn under two conditions . . .
>>> The garbage man continues, <<<
One: if the victim is a witch or two: if he owns a poodle.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
For my next witness, I call 'Fifi.'
>>> 
1991-07-02 * 
Dogbert and Dilbert sit at a table.  Dogbert says, <<<
The trial is going badly, so I'm trying to make a deal with the District Attorney.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
He offered to give me a Sony Walkman if you will accept the death penalty.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I think I can get a Walkman for you, too.
>>> 
1991-07-01 * 
Dogbert stands in front of the bench and says to a judge, <<<
Your Honor, my client has been accused of slaying an executive of his company . . .
>>> Dogbert holds up an x-ray image and continues, <<<
But these x-rays prove that the deceased died from choking on a waffle.
>>> The judge says, <<<
It looks like you drew these x-rays yourself.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Oh, I suppose there's a law against THAT, too!
>>> 
1991-06-30 * 
The Boss tells Dilbert and several co-workers, <<<
I've hired a consultant to clarify our company policy on discrimination.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
It is against policy to discriminate based on race, sex, age, handicap or religion.
>>> A man raises his hand and asks, <<<
Does that include unpopular, little religions?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
No, those are considered cults; you may discriminate freely against them.
>>> A woman raises her hand and asks, <<<
What about short, bald, fat, ugly men?  Are they considered 'handicapped'?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Technically, no.  You can still tease them and deny them promotions as usual.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Likewise, you may discriminate against nerds, smokers, and single people.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
And we've dropped 'stupid people' from the watch list, as their lobbying efforts proved ineffective . . .
>>> 
1991-06-29 * 
Dilbert sits in a prison cell with a large man.  The man asks, <<<
What are you in for?

Hey, look!  Corn for lunch.  Can you believe that?

1991-06-28 * 
Dilbert opens the door.  A police officer points a gun at him and says, <<<
You're under arrest for killing a senior executive of your company with an ear of corn.
>>> As the officer frisks him, beads of sweat fly off Dilbert's head and he cries, <<<
It . . . It was self-defense!  HE started the food fight!  I had just seasoned my corn . . . It was in my hand . . . It was just a reflex!!
>>> The officer says, <<<
The charge is 'a salt and buttering with intent to kill.'
>>> 
1991-06-27 * 
Dilbert arrives at home with food stuck to his suit.  Dogbert asks, <<<
How was your lunch with the executive vice president?
>>> Dilbert sits in his chair and says, <<<
Everything was fine until the food fight.  He started throwing au gratin potatoes . . . I countered with an ear of corn to his head and ran for the exit.
>>> Dilbert covers his eyes and says, <<<
When I left, he was face-down in the clam chowder and the kitchen staff was singing 'ding-dong the witch is dead.'

Dilbert and an executive sit at a table eating lunch.  The executive says, <<<
I have these lunches to find out what the workers are thinking.  You may speak freely.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Okay . . . It seems like the company is lacking leadership and direction.  The executives squelch all initiative by punishing those who take risks and voice opinions.
>>> The executive puts some food on his fork and says, <<<
You leave me little choice but to fling this au gratin potato at your forehead.
>>> 
1991-06-25 *

And of course, I'm much, much smarter.

1991-06-24 * 
Dilbert sits in his desk chair.  The Boss says, <<<
You've been randomly selected to have lunch with a senior executive of the company.

This is how the executives show that they are regular people, just like you and me.

I could squash you like a bug!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
>>> 
1991-06-23 * 
Dilbert stands at the counter wearing an apron.  He reads a recipe and thinks, <<<
Add one jar of spaghetti sauce . . .
>>> Dilbert struggles with the lid on the can. Dilbert lies on the counter trying to open the jar.  Dogbert says, <<<
Let me try to humiliate you by opening it easily.
>>> Dogbert struggles with the lid and thinks, <<<
This definitely would have worked in 'Family Circus.'
>>> Dogbert walks down the hall and says, <<<
I'll see if Bob can open it.
>>> Dogbert hands the jar to Bob the Dinosaur.  Bob says, <<<
No problem for a mighty dinosaur.
>>> Bob smashes the lid against his forehead. Dilbert scrapes the sauce off Bob's forehead and into the bowl.  Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
Will you STOP humming 'My Way.'

Can I freely enjoy it, or is it a sin?

I think it's okay.

Good, because I used a whole box yesterday.

1991-06-21 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert and another man, <<<
It's going to be another year of flogging dead horses.

But somehow we'll muddle through our internal bureaucracy, gouge our customers, and keep getting our tiny paychecks.

Sir, Wilson turned into a clump of uninspired sod.

It's just as well; he had a bad attitude.

Dogbert starts a tabloid newspaper devoted to lies about himself.

Where do you get your ideas?

Dogbert's impatience with fools was legendary.  He once choked a man by his necktie for asking stupid questions.

It happened one day when the fool was reading over Dogbert's shoulder and got too close.
>>> 
1991-06-19 * 
Dogbert stands on a desk chair typing while Dilbert looks over his shoulder.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm starting my own tabloid newspaper, the 'Dogbert Star.'
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
All of the stories will be sensational lies about me . . . That way I'll save money on lawsuits.

Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
I've solved an ancient puzzle.

1991-06-17 * 
Dilbert says to a man, <<<
I thought it was bad when they made us work in those little cubicles . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Then they put two people in each cubicle . . . But we got used to it.
>>> Dilbert, Wally and two other people hang from the wall.  Dilbert continues, <<<
I guess we'll get used to Velcro strips, too.

1991-06-16 * 
A man tells the Boss, <<<
You should have seen that fish . . .
>>> The Boss holds his arms out and says, <<<
That's nothing, compared to the fish I . . .
>>>  Dilbert walks around the corner. The Boss says, <<<
Hi, Dilbert.
>>> Dilbert sees his outstretched arms and thinks, <<<
He wants to hug me.  That's strange.  Okay, I'm a Nineties guy.
>>> Dilbert hugs him and says, <<<
Hi, Boss.
>>> The Boss and the other man look shocked. Dilbert thinks, <<<
Now I'll have to hug this guy so it doesn't seem awkward.
>>> Dilbert hugs the man and says, <<<
Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you.

I'm glad we've outgrown the uptight Eighties.

Dilbert and Dogbert sit outdoors.  Dogbert says, <<<
I've been thinking about my goal of becoming the supreme ruler of earth . . .
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I know EXACTLY how you feel.  I once had a goal of growing a mustache . . . But it was beyond my grasp.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I mean, figuratively beyond my grasp.  I could still reach my upper lip, you understand . . . But there was no reason to try.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Right, but back to me . . .
>>> 
1991-06-14 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert, Wally and a woman, <<<
I'm discontinuing the employee drug testing program . . .
>>> The Boss shows Dilbert a document and says, <<<
Because my own tests keep turning out positive . . . Which makes me suspect that some wise guy has tampered with the medical computer.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Denial and paranoia . . . Classic symptoms.
>>>  Wally asks, <<<
Is he 'high' right now?
>>> 
1991-06-13 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and says to Dogbert, <<<
It's an ethical dilemma . . . I support my company's goal of discouraging drug use, but the random drug testing policy is a violation of my constitutional rights.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I'll get fired if I refuse the test.  What is the ethical thing to do?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Hack into their computer and change your Boss's test results.
>>> Dilbert sits at his computer and says, <<<
Sometimes the straightest path is through the mud.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Good, rationalize it with an obtuse metaphor.
>>> 
1991-06-12 * 
Dilbert asks Wally, <<<
Don't you think the company's drug testing policy is a violation of our privacy?
>>>  Wally replies, <<<
I don't do drugs.
>>> The Boss reads a report and says, <<<
Johnson, your blood test results are in.  Looks like you live on Cheetos and Diet Pepsi . . . Your wife doesn't love you . . . And whoa . . What's this?
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Apparently, you like to dress in grass skirts and make fun of the lawnmower.
>>> 
1991-06-11 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk.  The Boss asks, <<<
Why have you refused to submit to our employee drug testing?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
It's violation of my privacy and an insult to my integrity.  I demand to be judged only on my PERFORMANCE.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
But your performance stinks,
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Performance AND attendance.
>>> 
1991-06-10 * 
The Boss says to Dilbert and Wally, <<<
Starting today, the company will begin random drug testing.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Although it would be illegal to search your car or home for illegal drugs . . .
>>> The Boss concludes, <<<
We have found no ethical problem with sucking the blood out of your body.  Results will be posted in the cafeteria.

1991-06-09 * 
Dogbert sits at the desk typing.  Dilbert asks, <<<
What are you working on?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I'm writing my own encyclopedia to sell for large profits.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How could you write an entire encyclopedia by yourself?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
It's abridged.  I had to cut some corners to get it all in five pages.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Five pages?!  You condensed the history and knowledge of the world into five pages?!!
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Actually, it's mostly about me . . . The other stuff didn't seem important.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
But I threw in some stuff about Canada to make it seem thorough.
>>> Dilbert reads, <<<
'Canada has trees.'"  Dogbert says, <<<
I'll have to tighten that section a bit.

I can get you a few more years by extending the line with this grease pencil.

Someday I should go back and have her lengthen my intelligence line too.

I'd hurry.

Lucky guess.

So, what should we do?  Cut the training budget again?

Dogbert and the Boss walk out of the Boss's office.  Dogbert says, <<<
My fee for business consulting is $200 an hour.

Fair enough.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I'll spend the day questioning your employees to identify problem areas.
>>> Later that day, Dogbert sits across from the Boss's desk.  Dogbert reads a document and says, <<<
It's unanimous.  They're underpaid and all the problems are your fault, 'Lard Head.'
>>> 
1991-06-03 * 
Dogbert sits across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
Why should I hire you as my business consultant?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I have credibility because I don't work for your company.  No smart person would work here full-time.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I work here full-time.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Sorry.  I'll try to speak slower.

Dilbert and Dogbert sit in the chair watching tv.  On the television program, there is a whack and someone grunts. Dogbert says, <<<
On television you can knock a person out with one karate chop.

Just think how useful that could be in real life.

Male daydream sequence.

This movie line is too long.

I'm glad nobody else thought of that first.

It's raining!!  Let's go frolic in the rain!!

Frolic?

This'd better have a huge payoff.

Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
This is my new optical disk player for the computer.
>>> Dilbert plugs the disk player into his computer and continues, <<<
Now I can instantly access the works of Shakespeare or study the history of Greece!
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
How often do you need to do that?
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
You just don't understand technology, do you?
>>>  Dogbert answers, <<<
I'm just a dog.

1991-05-30 * 
Dilbert stands at the counter in a retail store.  The salesclerk says, <<<
This Sony Sniffman makes a nice gift.
>>> The clerk continues, <<<
You can play the smells of your favorite stars!

Is it 'new Donny' or classic?

You're right . . . It's just so easy to get used to it being dirty.

It was worth a shot.

At Dogbert's School of Hard Knocks, you will gain the wisdom that can only be obtained through suffering.
>>> Dogbert opens a box and continues, <<<
Throughout the course, I'll be whacking you with various blunt objects.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
It may be unpleasant at first, but you'll get used to it.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Eventually, your brain will rationalize the whole experience.  You'll think I'm a dedicated teacher, and you'll actually believe you learned something.

Stick with the basics, I say.

That was surprisingly satisfying.

Feel free to gnaw on some high voltage wires, or whatever rats do, until I return.

Ratbert!

Madonna's 'Compulsion' perfume.  Why?

Apparently not.

Dogbert says to Ratbert, <<<
Ratbert, I need your help to solve the mystery of Dilbert's necktie.

It's not your brain power that I need.
>>>  Ratbert asks, <<<
Can we solve this with my good looks alone?
>>>

Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dogbert says, <<<
I've always wondered why your tie curls up like that.

Okay, four . . . And ten . . .

I get mail; therefore I am.

A man points to a painting and says to Dilbert, <<<
Notice how the eyes seem to follow you.
>>> Dilbert moves his head and says, <<<
Wow, that's a weird effect.

It gets better.
>>> Dilbert sits in his chair reading the newspaper.  The eyes from the painting followed him home and are sitting on the window sill.

How many people would like to see me make Johnson fetch this stick?
>>>  Everyone raises their hands.
>>>
1990-10-23 * 
The judge asks, <<<
Has the jury reached a verdict?

Yes, your honor.  We find the defense attorney poorly dressed and obnoxious.  We sentence him to death.

I don't think you can do that.
>>>  Dogbert continues, <<<
Furthermore, we find that your honor looks fetching in a black muumuu.

Dogbert sits on a park bench with a woman holding a baby.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Why are you hugging that loaf of French bread?
>>> The woman replies, <<<
Hee hee!  Yeah, newborn babies do look like loaves of bread.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
But in this case I think your baby IS a loaf of French bread.
>>> The woman looks closely at the blanket and says, <<<
That would explain the smell of dough.
>>> The woman takes the bread out of the blanket.  She says, <<<
Must have been a mix-up at the grocery store.
>>> The woman says, <<<
I hope this doesn't mean somebody is sticking little Jimmy in a toaster somewhere.

I'm sure he'll pop up.

Chances are that it was nobody you know.

Dilbert and Dogbert sit in the jury box.  Dogbert yells, <<<

Well, not really, but I always wanted to say that.

The defense lawyer says to the jury, <<<
My client has been accused of the most heinous crimes.

Ooh!  Ooh!  I know this one!!

The caption says, <<<

This jury is acceptable to the defense.

1990-10-16 * 
Dogbert reads a letter and says, <<<
What a stupid waste of my valuable time.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's your civic duty.  It's the small dues you pay for living in a just and free society.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Big whoopee.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
And you get to play God with other people's lives.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Well, they should say that in the letter.
>>>
1990-10-15 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the mailbox reading a letter.  Dilbert says, <<<
Oh, carp!

I've been called for jury duty.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Me, too.

Dogs can't do jury duty.  How did they get your name?

I've been betrayed by Ed McMahon.

Act like we didn't see it or we might get hurt.

I assume there's some sort of reward for this.

Look!  I got Chiclets!

There . . . That wasn't too hard.

Now imagine a tractor on your chest . . .

1990-10-11 * 
Dilbert reads a letter that says, <<<
Dear Dilbert, I hope you like this elbow warmer I knitted for you.  Love, Aunt Helen.

We're just the victims in all this, Dogbert.

Dilbert, I need to fill out an absence report for the days you missed work.

Well, Mother Nature got mad and had wild deer kill me.  But my garbage man and my dog cloned me back to life.

I'll put 'sick.'

Dilbert, who is naked, picks Dogbert up and says, <<<

Don't tell the ancient dogs I settled for a banana split.

Dogbert stands on a table rubbing a lamp.  Dilbert asks, <<<
Why are you rubbing that lamp?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
It's a routine check for magic genies.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Carry on.
>>> A genie pops out of the lamp and says, <<<
You have released me.
>>> Dogbert shouts, <<<
Yes!!!  Ha, ha!!  Now you must grant me three wishes!
>>> The genie replies, <<<
Get real, four-eyes.  We don't have a binding contract here.

I LIKE living in a lamp.  You disturbed me.  I'm going to turn you into a wiener and go home.

At least it's an experience I can relish.
>>>
1990-10-06 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
Hi . . . Uh, why am I naked and sitting in a garbage can?

Either you were killed by wild deer and we cloned you back to life from your old garbage . . . Or . . .
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I hope I like the second choice.

. . . Or you saved a lot of money on an above-ground pool.

Please, Mister Garbage Man, help us fix Dilbert's cloning device and bring him back to life!!

You're going to clone him from his own garbage?

Don't tell anybody - there might be a stigma.
>>>
1990-10-03 * 
The garbage man asks Dogbert, <<<
Not much garbage . . . Did somebody die?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Dilbert went to the compost pile in the sky.
>>> The garbage man reads a piece of paper and says, <<<
Bad timing . . . Judging from last week's garbage, he had almost finished his cloning machine design.  I only notice a few linear math errors.
>>> The garbage man continues, <<<
This design would just create a hologram and a bad chile con carne recipe.

Man, you sure know your garbage!

Dogbert sits on his pillow thinking, <<<
Ugh . . . Gosh, what a nightmare.

Not so good, Doc.

I have a bad case of 'happy tongue.'
>>> The vet says, <<<
Hmm . . . Is your tongue happy for any particular reason?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
No reason at all.  I'm quite worried.
>>> The vet says, <<<
I'm going to prescribe these tongue depressors.  Use one every time your tongue gets too mirthful.
>>> Dogbert leaves the office humming.  The doctor thinks, <<<
I like that dog.
>>>
1990-09-29 * 
Dogbert walks down the stairs holding a gadget.  Dogbert says, <<<
If Dilbert wanted me to have this when he died it must have been special to him.  But what is it?
>>> Bob the Dinosaur says, <<<
We dinosaurs have a method for handling things we don't understand.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Tell me.
>>> Bob replies, <<<
We stomp it to bits and evolve into birds who don't care.
>>>
1990-09-28 * 
Bob the Dinosaur says to Dogbert, <<<
That's all Dilbert left you in his will?  A gadget?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I'm just the custodian.
>>> Bob says, <<<
Maybe it's some kind of hyper-electronic induction transmutant geoplasmic nodal collectimizer.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Maybe . . . But I'm guessing bathroom soap dispenser.
>>>  Bob picks up the device and asks, <<<
Can I change my guess?
>>>
1990-09-27 * 
Bob the Dinosaur asks Dogbert, <<<
What did Dilbert leave you in his will?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
He stiffed me.
>>> Dogbert holds a device and explains, <<<
All I got is custody of this stupid invention of his . . . I don't even know what it does.
>>> Bob says, <<<
I get it . . . He 'stiffed' you . . . Hee-hee!
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Try to stay with me, Bob.

1990-09-23 * 
Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
I've decided we need more structure in this household.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Things are out of control . . . We have no procedures . . . No rules . . . It's totally unmanageable.
>>> Dilbert points to a file cabinet and continues, <<<
That's why I've developed a set of forms to guide our daily interactions.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
For example, this P-38 form is a request for additional food.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
The P-39 is for liquids and the P-40 is a convenient way to request both food and liquids.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Give me a P-39 form . . . I'm a little dry.
>>> Later, Dogbert hands Dilbert the form and says, <<<
Under 'purpose for distribution' I put 'thirsty.'  I hope that's right.
>>> Dilbert writes on the form and says, <<<
Request denied . . . You used an outdated form.

Don't talk back to me!!

I work hard to give you a lovely planet, and look what you do to it!

But . . . But I recycle newspapers!

Oh, well, excuse ME.  I guess the dolphins are safe, thanks to you.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
And I've noticed less acid rain since I started.

Mother Nature enters holding a stick and says, <<<
Okay, everybody off!  Let's go, get off!!

Move along now.  Find another planet.

I have some coupons for totally unrelated products and a fourth-party personal check from North Yemen.

These are not necessarily the views of this station.

Don't listen you him.  They always say that.

Dilbert says to a man from Ed's TV Repair, <<<
I'd fix it myself but I know it takes special tools . . .

They'll knock you out until I'm gone.

Dogbert sits on a bench with a man who says, <<<
. . . I'll tell you why we're losing to foreign business: the workers in this country have lost their work ethic.

Why aren't you working now?
>>> The man replies, <<<
Well, now, this is a PERFECT example of what I'm trying to tell you.

A NASA scientist points to a diagram of the space shuttle and tells Dilbert, <<<
You will be with one other . . . Uh . . . Astronaut in a private room.

You two will have no specific duties on this mission.  I'll be monitoring you on video.
>>> Another scientist watches Dilbert and the monkey fight with each other on the video screen and says, <<<
A nerd, a monkey, and one Nintendo at zero gravity . . . Pretty risky experiment.
>>>  The scientist replies, <<<
To be honest, we were running low on good ideas.
>>>
1990-09-10 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the mailbox.  Dilbert reads a letter and says, <<<
Yes!  I've been chosen for the next space shuttle mission!!
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Why you?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
They're probably assembling leaders from different fields.

In our next flight, we will study the effects of weightlessness on nerds . . .

Dilbert lies on the couch.  He thinks, <<<
Uh-oh . . . My foot is asleep.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I'd better hop around . . . Oh no, my arm is asleep too.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Ouch, ouch!!  I'll have to hop and wave my arm.
>>> Dogbert watches Dilbert hopping and waving his arms. Dilbert speaks to Dogbert and his words are slurred.  He thinks, <<<
My tongue is asleep.
>>> Dilbert runs into the chair. Dilbert lies face down on the chair.  He says, <<<
Aaahhh . . . It's okay now, Dogbert.  Everything is back to normal.
>>> Dilbert adds, <<<
Except my nose is asleep and I feel a sneeze coming on.
>>>
1990-09-08 * 
A man stands outside Dilbert's house and says to Dogbert, <<<
Goodbye . . . I think your 'New Age Mineral Water Spa' has been a complete rip-off!
>>> Dogbert turns on a hose and says, <<<
I'm sorry you feel that way . . . Here's a free gallon of miracle hose water.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You're an evil little dog.
>>>  Dogbert points the hose at Dilbert and asks, <<<
Thirsty?
>>>
1990-09-07 * 
Dogbert uses a megaphone to address several people wearing only towels.  Dogbert says, <<<
You are now ready for the next step in my 'New Age Mineral Water Spa' therapy.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
This next therapy was practiced by the pharaohs . . . It has been scientifically proven to produce deep relaxation.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Please pick up a roll of bandages and line up in front of the pyramid door . . .
>>>
1990-09-06 * 
Dogbert says to several people wearing only towels, <<<
Thank you all for coming to Dogbert's 'New Age Mineral Water Spa.'" Dogbert continues, <<<

Dogbert sits behind a cash register and says to a customer, <<<
Welcome to Dogbert's New Age Mineral Water Spa . . . Hand over the cash.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Hold it . . . The vibes from my crystal tell me we knew each other in a previous life . . . In ATLANTIS!
>>> A man says, <<<
That's what you told the last guy, too.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Atlantis was a small town.  I ran the only donut shop.

1990-09-04 * 
Dogbert says to Bob the Dinosaur, <<<
Bob, I'd like you to be the masseur for my New Age Miracle Spa.
>>>  Bob replies, <<<
Dinosaurs don't know much about massage.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
That's okay.  Just hurt the clients as much as possible.
>>> Bob asks, <<<
Won't they get angry?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Bob, Bob, Bob . . . You really aren't tuned to the New Age, are you?

Here's a brochure for my new miracle mineral water spa.

Dilbert sits at his desk thinking, <<<
The worst he can do is fire me . . .

Boss, I need to talk to you.

I feel you don't respect me . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
It's an intangible thing . . .
>>>  The Boss thinks, <<<
Sneeze coming . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I see it in your body language . . .
>>>  The Boss grabs Dilbert's shirt. Dilbert continues, <<<
. . . And sometimes the things you say . . .
>>>  The Boss rips Dilbert's shirt off his body. The Boss sneezes and uses Dilbert's shirt as a handkerchief. Dilbert sits at his desk without a shirt.  He says, <<<
This has been something less than a victory for workers everywhere.
>>>
1990-09-01 * 
Dilbert has fins strapped to his elbows and head.  Dilbert asks Dogbert, <<<
Well?  What do you think?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Uh . . .
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
They're fins . . . Human aerodynamics!  The field is totally neglected!!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You don't seem to be sharing my joy of innovation.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I'm just wondering how Darwin would explain it.
>>>
1990-08-31 * 
Dilbert lies on a couch in a psychiatrist's office.  The therapist says, <<<
Frankly, I'm tired of hearing your little problems . . .
>>> The psychologist says, <<<
I hate my job . . . I haven't had a decent date in a year . . . My biological clock is ticking away . . .
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Would it be unethical to date one of your patients?
>>>  The doctor replies, <<<
Yes, especially an ugly one.
>>>
1990-08-30 * 
Dilbert lies on a couch and explains to a therapist, <<<
. . . Whenever I'm near a hardware store I feel an invisible force drawing me inside . . .
>>> The psychologist says, <<<
You've been talking about yourself since you got here.  We never talk about ME and MY feelings.  I hurt too, you know.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm paying $75 an hour . . .
>>>  The psychiatrist says, <<<
Good Lord, and you think that makes it okay to be selfish??
>>>
1990-08-29 * 
Dilbert lies on a couch and a therapist sits next to him taking notes.  Dilbert says, <<<
. . . And I've had this irrational love for hardware stores as long as I can remember.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I mean . . I LOVE them.  I ACTUALLY love them.  You gotta help me, doc.
>>> The psychiatrist says, <<<
I've heard of this . . . I think the literature refers to it as 'a stupid guy-thing.'
>>>
1990-08-28 * 
Dilbert arrives at home carrying a bag full of tools.  Bob the Dinosaur says, <<<
Looks like another shopping binge at the hardware store.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I couldn't resist.
>>> Dilbert takes a drill out of the bag and says, <<<
Gee, Bob, what did dinosaurs do before tools were invented?
>>>  Bob replies, <<<
It was hard . . .
>>> Bob continues, <<<
Sometime, you should try to tighten a Phillips screw with a fern.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
That's no way to live.
>>>
1990-08-27 * 
Dilbert walks by Herman's Hardware Store and thinks, <<<
Oh no . . . I'm being drawn to that hardware store.

The force is ripping my clothes off, but I can resist!!!
>>> Dilbert says to a salesclerk, <<<
I'm only looking for my clothes - I'm not shopping.
>>>  The clerk replies, <<<
You're not the first naked engineer to use that story.
>>>
1990-08-26 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the table eating dinner.  Dilbert says, <<<
You shouldn't salt your food before tasting it.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
It's a calculated risk . . .
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
The average mouthful of food is five percent of the total serving.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
So timid salters eat five percent of almost every meal with too little salt . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Because only one time in a thousand is food too salty to begin with.
>>> Dogbert concludes, <<<
Therefore, over a lifetime you experience almost five percent less salt-related happiness than I do.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Not necessarily.  I usually salt my tongue after the first swallow.
>>>
1990-08-25 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
It's NOT a stupid idea.
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
You see, people who don't own cars are missing out on the prestige of using car phones.
>>> Dilbert has turned a phone booth on its side and added wheels, a steering wheel and a drivers seat.  Dilbert continues, <<<
The car-phonebooth is a natural solution . . . Granted, it uses a lot of coins.
>>>  Dogbert walks away.
>>>
1990-08-24 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Wally enters and asks, <<<
Working hard?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Hardly working!
>>>  Dilbert giggles and snorts.  Wally says, <<<
You snorted.
>>> Back at home, Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
It was my best line of the day . . . Then I snorted.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
The curse of the engineer.
>>>
1990-08-23 * 
Dogbert stands on the sidewalk holding a sign that says <<<
Fur is Murder.
>>>  There is a <<<
Fur Sale" sign in the store behind him. The proprietor asks, <<<
What's yer problem with my store, dog?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I oppose the sale of fur.
>>> The storekeeper says, <<<
I'm not selling fur.  The whole store is 'fur sale.'"  Dogbert says, <<<
I oppose bad spelling too.
>>>
1990-08-22 * 
Dogbert holds a sign that says <<<
Fur is Murder.
>>>  Dogbert asks a woman in a fur coat, <<<
How can you live with yourself?  Have you no conscience?

Oh, big deal . . . A bunch of minks get bad haircuts and I get a warm coat . . . I'll bet you'd make a nice pair of mittens.
>>> Dogbert says as he walks away, <<<
I don't think I reached her.
>>>
1990-08-21 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
I've decided to join the anti-fur movement.

Isn't that hypocritical?  You wear a fur coat every day.

Oh . . . Yeah, never mind . . .
>>> Dogbert thinks, <<<
Wait . . .
>>>

Great . . . Not only am I being forced to work in the accounting department, but I'm slowly turning into a troll.
>>> Dilbert looks at a document and thinks, <<<
Wait a minute . . . This is the budget for the accounting department itself . . . What happens if I erase IT?
>>> Bradley looks at the witch who is melting away and yells, <<<
Boss!!?  Boss!!?
>>>  The witch yells, <<<
Help me!  I'm melting!  Aaaaagh!!
>>>
1990-08-19 * 
Dilbert stands at a desk and Dogbert sits next to a telescope.  Dilbert says, <<<
According to my calculations, the asteroid 'Sagnorpt' will collide with earth in 2.3 minutes.
>>> Dogbert covers his eyes and screams, <<<
We're all gonna die!
>>> Dogbert hugs Dilbert's legs and shouts, <<<
I'm sorry about all of those bad things I've done to you!
>>> Dogbert cries, <<<
I renounce my evil ways!  I dedicate the remaining minute of my life to the poor!!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Waitta minute . . . Why aren't you groveling for salvation?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
The asteroid is only the size of a golf ball.
>>> There's a large crash. Dilbert lies on the floor after the asteroid hits him on the head.  Dogbert says, <<<
I probably shouldn't try to read too much into this.
>>>

The caption says, <<<
Dilbert is forced to work in the accounting department.
>>>  Dilbert has turned into a troll.  Bradley the Troll says, <<<
First you must understand how numbers change reality . . .
>>> Bradley continues, <<<
Some people think numbers merely REFLECT reality . . . But we believe that numbers CREATE reality.
>>> Bradley shows Dilbert a room where an overseer cracks a whip at several other trolls.  Bradley says, <<<
This our budget-erasing room . . .
>>>  The supervisor yells, <<<
Erase faster!!
>>>
1990-08-17 * 
Dilbert says to a witch, <<<
No!  You can't force me to work in accounting!  I'm an engineer!
>>>  The witch replies, <<<
It's too late . . .
>>> The witch explains, <<<
You came . . . You breathed the air . . . The change is irreversible . . . Bradley will train you.
>>> Spikes grow out of Dilbert's back and he begins to turn into a troll.  Dilbert says, <<<
I'm starting to get a bad attitude about this job . . .
>>>  Bradley the Troll replies, <<<
Good.  I can skip that part of the training.
>>>
1990-08-16 * 
A witch says to Dilbert, <<<
So . . . You've come to the accounting department for an explanation of the budget report, aye?  Unchain him, Bradley.
>>> Dilbert walks next to the witch who tells him, <<<
Normally we would torture and kill you for questioning our report.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
But you realized that my questions are valid?
>>>  The witch puts a hat on Bradley the Troll.  The witch replies, <<<
No.  I'm promoting Bradley.  You're my new analyst.

Fool!  Why have you come to the accounting department?!!

Uh . . . I had some questions, sir . . . Ma'am . . . Er, sir?
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Are you a man or woman?
>>>  The witch replies, <<<
In accounting, it doesn't really matter.
>>>
1990-08-14 * 
Dilbert approaches a door with a skull over it and thinks, <<<
This must be the company accounting department.
>>> A troll opens the door.  Dilbert shows him a document and says, <<<
I . . . I need to ask some questions about this b-budget report.
>>> Dilbert is wrapped in chains and guarded by the troll who holds a spear.  Dilbert asks a witch sitting in a throne, <<<
Is this a bad time for you?
>>>  The witch replies, <<<
Always.
>>>
1990-08-13 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, go down to the accounting department and find out what these figures mean.
>>>  Dilbert gulps. Dilbert yells as the Boss walks away, <<<
No . . . P-please . . . They aren't even human there!!!
>>> A witch looks into a crystal ball and sees Dilbert sitting at his desk.  The witch says, <<<
I don't like him.
>>>  A troll thinks, <<<
Surprise.
>>>
1990-08-12 * 
Dogbert stands behind Dilbert's desk and asks, <<<
Want to hear some engineer jokes?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
No.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
How many engineers does it take to change a lightbulb?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Six: one to hold the bulb and five to argue about how to rotate it on this side of the equator.
>>>  Dogbert giggles. Dogbert says, <<<
What's the difference between a fungus and an engineer?  A fungus can grow on you . . .
>>>  He laughs. Dogbert asks, <<<
What do you call a dog that's been run over by a steamroller?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Spot.
>>> Dogbert leaves the room and says, <<<
We were having such a good time until he started getting personal.
>>>
1990-08-11 * 
Dilbert yells, <<<
Dogbert!  I'm home after my second major surgery in two weeks!

. . . So after the first operation they discover that a tiny convict and a nurse had hidden inside my torso to escape . . .

Boy . . . It sure is hard to keep a medical story interesting.
>>>
1990-08-10 * 
Dilbert stands behind an x-ray machine.  Dr. Fishlips points to the x-ray and tells a police officer, <<<
There he is . . . Tiny Tom the Convict is clinging to this man's pancreas.
>>> The panels says, <<<
Note:  Sometimes it is necessary to suspend disbelief for the purpose of creating comic situations.  Parents should explain to their children that convicts will rarely, if ever, cling to another person's pancreas.
>>> The doctor says, <<<
Ho ho, it appears we have also located our own Nurse Woodmeyer . . . The tramp!
>>>
1990-08-09 * 
Dilbert sits on an examining table.  Dr. Fishlips says, <<<
A patient from the prison disappeared after your appendectomy.
>>>  A police officer stands next to the doctor. The policeman says, <<<
'Tiny Tom' is a master of escape.  We think he crawled into your torso during the operation.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
That's stupid.  How would he get out?
>>>  The officer asks, <<<
Ever see the movie 'Alien?'
>>>
1990-08-08 * 
A physician says into the telephone, <<<
Hello, Dilbert, this is Doctor Fishlips.  I was wondering if you could come back for some x-rays.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
X-rays?  Is that standard procedure a week after an appendectomy?
>>> A police officer stands next to the doctor.  Dr. Fishlips says, <<<
A patient from the prison is missing . . . I'm told this isn't the first time 'Tiny Tom' has tried a bold escape.
>>>
1990-08-07 * 
Dilbert sits on a weight lifting bench holding dumbells.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
The experts used to say you should exercise every day.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Now they think twenty minutes every other day is just as good.
>>> Dilbert collapses onto the bench and thinks, <<<
My strategy of five minutes a month is looking pretty clever.
>>>
1990-08-06 * 
Dogbert sits on his pillow watching television.  A news reporter says, <<<
A scientist reports that love made a lab rat stupid.
>>> The newscaster continues, <<<
The scientist cautioned the media not to draw conclusions based on one rat.
>>> The cover of Time Magazine has a picture of Ratbert and the caption <<<
Love and SAT Scores.
>>>
1990-08-05 * 
Dogbert enters the living room carrying the newspaper.  He thinks, <<<
Oh good, Dogbert isn't around.  I can read the Sunday paper without having to share.
>>> Dilbert sits in his chair and thinks, <<<
Ahhh . . . Mine are the first hands to unfold its crisp little pages.  I alone determine the order of reading.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Nobody will blurt out the punchlines before I read them.
>>> Dogbert flies through the air onto Dilbert's lap. Dogbert knocks the chair over and the paper scatters on the floor.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Were you finished with this section?
>>>
1990-08-04 * 
Ratbert sniffs and says, <<<
Goodbye, Dogbert.  I must return to the lab with the professor.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
That's stupid.
>>> Ratbert says, <<<
He says he loves me.  That must be why he fed me so much.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
You're getting stupider.
>>> Ratbert says as he walks away, <<<
I have to follow my heart.
>>>  Dogbert thinks, <<<
Hmm . . . Love causes stupidity in lab rats.
>>>
1990-08-03 * 
A scientist points at Ratbert and says, <<<
Ahaa!  There's my runaway lab rat!  I'd recognize little XP-39C anywhere!
>>> The scientist says to Ratbert, <<<
All is forgiven.  Come back to your job at the lab.  I love you.
>>> The professor tells Dilbert, <<<
He was specially bred to have no will power.

No offense taken.

Dogbert says to a rat, <<<
If you're going to live here, you need a name.

How about 'Mickey?'" Dogbert replies, <<<
No . . . Big trouble.  How about 'Rodney the Rodent?'"  The rat asks, <<<
How about 'Bill the Rat?'" Dogbert asks, <<<
Vernon the Vermin?

Ratbert.

1990-07-30 * 
Dogbert says, <<<
Dilbert, this is a rat.  Rat, this is Dilbert.
>>>  The rat says, <<<
I've come to live here!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
How lucky for us.  We were just saying how much we needed a plague-carrying vermin to round out the household.
>>> The rat says to Dogbert, <<<
He doesn't have much of a personality . . .
>>>  Dogbert replies, I usually drown him out with the television.
>>>

Yip!

I am Thor!!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Take some athpirin.
>>> Thor reads a list and says, <<<
We're looking for some new Norse gods to update our image.  Your name came up.
>>> Thor continues, <<<
It's the same way I got started.  I worked my way up from God of Static Cling.
>>> Dogbert reads the list and says, <<<
Hmm . . . 'God of Velcro' looks interesting.
>>> Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert stands on the hassock with a towel wrapped around him.  Dogbert says, <<<
Don't laugh.  I put your name in for God of Mayonnaise.
>>>
1990-07-28 * 
Dogbert sits in the chair and a rat sits on the hassock.  The rat says, <<<
I wasn't getting any respect at the lab . . . I felt used.
>>> The rat continues, <<<
Sure . . . The food was good - and LOTS of it . . . But I don't think the professor valued me as an individual.
>>> The rat continues, <<<
And a rat without respect is like . . . Like . . .
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Like you.
>>>
1990-07-27 * 
A rat says to Dogbert, <<<
Greetings, Dog.  I've come to live in your house and escape from my job at the laboratory.
>>> The rat continues, <<<
You could think of me as a political exile seeking sanctuary in a friendly embassy.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I could think of you as a rat.
>>>  The rat says, <<<
Okay, but I don't expect any special treatment.
>>>
1990-07-26 * 
Dilbert hears a scratching noise and asks, <<<
What's that noise?
>>> Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dogbert replies, <<<
It sounds like a rat, escaped from a nearby laboratory, chewing a hole through our front door to avoid sure death from a hideous macaroni-and-cheese experiment.
>>> Dilbert sees a rat walk into the room and says, <<<
That's amazing.
>>>  Dogbert holds his ears and replies, <<<
These babies aren't just for good looks, you know.

1990-07-25 * 
A lab rat thinks, <<<
I hate my life.

If I eat one more ton of macaroni and cheese I think I'll die . . . Of course, that may be the point.

Tonight I'm going 'over the wall.'  Wait . . . I'm a rat . . . I'll go THROUGH the wall.
>>>
1990-07-24 * 
A lab rat says to a scientist, <<<
Doc, we have to talk.
>>> The rat continues, <<<
Every day you feed me over a hundred pounds of macaroni and cheese . . . At first I thought you were just being a good host.
>>> The rat continues, <<<
But lately I've been thinking it could be something far more sinister.
>>>  The professor writes in his notebook, <<<
Macaroni and cheese causes paranoia.

Here we have a lab rat, specially bred to be susceptible to peer pressure.

How about a brewski?

I don't drink.
>>>  The scientist says, <<<
All the cool rats drink beer.

Okay.

Of course, there's more to science than just hurting animals, but frankly it's the part I like best.

Holy hairballs!  What are you?!!

I am the 'Dust Bunny,' an emerging cultural icon.

Once a year I come to every home and hide clumps of dust under furniture and major appliances.
>>> The dust bunny says, <<<
You must honor me by decorating closet doors and singing dust hymns.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
What about gifts?  Do I get any gifts out of this?
>>> The dust bunny replies, <<<
No.  The dust bunny symbolizes only love, goodwill and very poor housekeeping.
>>> Dogbert sucks up the dust bunny with a vacuum cleaner.  He looks at the reader and says, <<<
I know, it seems harsh, but you have to nip these things in the bud.
>>>  The dust bunny cries from inside the vacuum, <<<
Okay, gifts!
>>>

Dilbert and Dogbert sit at a table in a restaurant.  The waiter hands Dilbert the check and says, <<<
I've taken the liberty of calculating a twenty-percent tip.
>>> The server continues, <<<
It's written on the back next to a picture of a smiling diner . . . A fifteen-percent tip is shown by the picture of a guilty-looking diner.

Below that is a picture of a diner and his dog with salad forks in their backs . . .

To learn their technology and bring it back here?

Dilbert and a woman sit at a table in a restaurant.  The woman says, <<<
I like a man who makes eye contact.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Uh no . . . Uncontrollable urge to look away . . . I've got to blink about twenty times.  Why did she have to bring that up?
>>> Dilbert covers his eyes, screams, knocks his drink over and blinks repeatedly.  The woman turns to the reader and says, <<<
I love doing that.
>>>
1990-07-17 * 
Dilbert thinks, <<<
I'm feeling timid today . . . I felt timid yesterday too . . .
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Holy cheese!  I may be a timid person.

I've decided to build a blanket fort with the living room furniture and live in it forever.

I'm so proud of you.

The caption says, <<<
Prehistoric Dilbert . . .

What is that?

I call it 'the wheel.'" Dilbert and Dogbert try to cook food over the wheel as if it were a fire.

1990-07-15 * 
Dilbert sits at a banquet table with three other people.  The Boss stands at the podium and says, <<<
Thank you all for coming to Irv Klepfurd's retirement celebration.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Many of you know that Irv has been pilfering office supplies for his entire career.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
In fact, he's only retiring now because he finished construction on his garage made entirely of paper clips.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
This bill is for $87,000 of personal phone calls made from the office.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
Instead of a gold watch, I'm going to write the current time on this yellow sticky pad and slap it on his forehead.
>>> The Boss slaps Irv. The Boss continues, <<<
Now . . . I understand we have some birthdays today . . .

1990-07-14 * 
Dilbert enters an auto service store and says to an auto mechanic, <<<
Just a quick question: is is necessary to change my oil . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
. . . Or can I just keep letting it run dry and then add new oil?
>>> The car mechanic looks shocked. The mechanic screams and falls to the ground.  Dilbert looks at the reader and says, <<<
I think the answer is going to be 'no' to that second option.
>>>
1990-07-13 * 
A man asks Dilbert, <<<
How's the new secretary for the department working out?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
I think he's having a self-image problem.
>>> The secretary sits at his desk and says, <<<
Sure, I'm a secretary, but watch me crush this paper clip!!
>>>
1990-07-12 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dilbert says, <<<
My boss asked me to supervise the department secretary.  I don't know how to manange people . . .
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Try positive reinforcement.  Praise the things he does right.  Trust him to make the right choices.
>>> At work, the secretary says to Dilbert, <<<
I forgot to write down your messages, so I just put a bunch of gibberish on little pieces of paper.
>>>
1990-07-11 * 
Dilbert says to a man at a desk, <<<
As your new supervisor, I want to discuss your career path.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
You're a secretary now, but what do you want to be in two years?
>>>  The man replies, <<<
A famous actor . . . Or maybe a doctor.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Uh . . . I don't think I can help you here . . .
>>>  The man replies, <<<
Oh, right, but you'll expect me to work hard for you.
>>>
1990-07-10 * 
The Boss says, <<<
Dilbert, I'm putting you in charge of the department secretary.
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
See if you can get him to cut down on the personal calls.
>>> The secretary sits at his desk wearing a sombrero and holding maracas.  Dilbert says, <<<
. . . Just be a little more discreet . . . For example, try NOT wearing the traditional costume of the countries you're calling.

1990-07-09 * 
Dilbert stands in front of a man's desk and says, <<<
Hi.  You must be the new secretary.
>>>  The man replies, <<<
Well, yes and no . . .
>>> The man explains, <<<
Granted, I'm temporarily being paid for performing secretary-like duties.  But I'm really an author, a jazz pianist and a thespian.  I have a Ph.D. in Psychology.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Sounds like a little crisis with the ol' self-image.
>>>  The man adds, <<<
And a gourmet chef . . .

What if people had tails?  First of all, it would look darned silly.

He's bluffing.

Control . . . Don't wag . . .

Jury trials would be simpler.

. . . Then I found my husband dead.
>>>  The judge and a lawyer stare at her wagging tail. The caption says, <<<
And parties would be even more awkward.
>>>  Dilbert talks to a man with a bandage on his head and his arm in a sling.  The man says, <<<
That's when I learned that if you drive a Porsche, you should never make fun of a man on a steamroller.
>>>  Dilbert's tail wags as he replies, <<<
Tragic . . . Really.
>>>
1990-07-07 *

Your ears will return to normal when you forgive me for scaring you yesterday.

Nothing inspires forgiveness quite like revenge.

Boo!

Eeek!

The good news is you'll handle better on corners . . .

Injury?

Dial 911.

Poisoning?

Dial 911.

Oh, wow . . . I'm drawing a complete blank here . . .
>>>
1990-07-04 * 
A man says to his wife, <<<
. . . We should at least interview him.  Nobody else even answered our ad for a babysitter.
>>> The woman says to Bob the Dinosaur, <<<
Frankly, Bob, we're concerned that you might try to eat the children.
>>> Bob replies, <<<
Well, of course, in that case there would be no charge for the evening.
>>>  The husband says, <<<
He's more than fair.
>>>
1990-07-03 * 
Bob the Dinosaur stands at a man's door and says, <<<
Hi.  I'm Bob.  I called earlier about the babysitting job.
>>> The man says, <<<
To be honest, we didn't know you were a dinosaur when you called . . .
>>> Bob replies, <<<
That's okay.  I didn't know you were yuppie bigots.
>>>
1990-07-02 * 
Bob the Dinosaur reads the newspaper and says to Dogbert, <<<
Here's a 'help wanted' ad for a babysitter.
>>> Bob says, <<<
I could do that.  Kids love dinosaurs.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
One problem.
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
Your species of know to be carnivorous.
>>>  Bob replies, <<<
I'll put 'strict disciplinarian' on my resume.

Dilbert and Dogbert stand in the hallway of a couple's house.  The man says, <<<
We're so glad you guys could stop by.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Thanks for inviting us.
>>>  Dogbert thinks, <<<
We hardly know them.
>>> The woman says, <<<
I'd offer you some coffee, but that would be a bother.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Uh . . . None for me.  Thanks.
>>> The woman says, <<<
I noticed you didn't bring any food as a courtesy to your hosts.  I guess we'll eat when you leave.
>>> The man says, <<<
We usually watch television now, but I'll try not to appear bitter about your visit.
>>> The man and woman sit in chairs while Dilbert and Dogbert sit on the floor.  The man asks, <<<
Why haven't we done this sooner?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
We thought you were scum.
>>>
1990-06-30 * 
Dilbert looks out the window and says, <<<
Looks like the police found your trail, Dogbert.  You'd better hide.
>>> A police officer says to Dilbert, <<<
We're looking for a dog who destroyed half of the city.  Does this sketch look familiar?
>>> Dilbert looks at the drawing and replies, <<<
Yeah . . . It's 'Mister Potato Head' . . . or maybe 'Ziggy.'"  The officer says, <<<
We gotta get a better artist.
>>>
1990-06-29 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
Just great . . . You've destroyed half of the city with my 'Sonic Obliterator' invention . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
You're being pursued by the police, FBI and National Guard . . . I TRUSTED you.  Is there anything you'd like to say to me?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Oh, yeah, thank you very much for letting me borrow the Obliterator . . . It's been great . . . Can I use it again tomorrow?
>>>
1990-06-28 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair watching television.  The newscaster says, <<<
Our top story: a dog with glasses was seen blowing up empty mail trucks with some type of 'Sonic Obliterator.'" The reporter continues, <<<
Much of the city is in ruins, as the dog blasted through building to escape police and National Guard pursuit.
>>> Dogbert says to Dilbert, <<<
On the plus side, we have a much better shortcut to the post office.
>>>
1990-06-27 * 
Dogbert stands outside the post office truck yard holding the Sonic Obliterator.  Dogbert says, <<<
On one hand, I know it's wrong to use Dilbert's invention to blow up these empty mail trucks.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
On the other paw, this is gonna be more fun than sneezing on strangers.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
It's a moral dilemma . . . But I like to think that difficult choices like this build character.
>>>  Dogbert presses the trigger.
>>>
1990-06-26 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk holding his invention.  Dogbert asks, <<<
May I play with your 'Sonic Obliterator' invention?
>>>  Dilbert answers, <<<
Sure.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Just be careful.  It has a hair trigger and can blow a truck to bits.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Neat!
>>> Dilbert turns toward the reader and says, <<<
You have to show them that you trust them.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I'll be down at the post office truck yard.
>>>
1990-06-25 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk holding a device that looks like a gun.  Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
This could be my most important technical achievement yet.  I'll call it the 'Sonic Obliterator.'  Hmm . . . Catchy.
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
This baby can blast a buffalo into random particles in about half a nanosecond.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Of course, it might have limited application around the house.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
At least the buffalos will show us some respect.
>>>
1990-06-24 * 
Dilbert and a woman sit on the couch.  The woman asks, <<<
Would you like to hold hands?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
We'd better not . . . My dog is around here someplace.
>>> The woman asks, <<<
What's your dog got to do with anything?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
He's a bit prudish.  He won't allow it in his house.
>>> The woman replies, <<<
HIS house?  Ha ha ha!  He's YOUR dog!  YOU're the master!
>>> The woman continues laughing and says, <<<
Your dog is just a stupid hairball!  And you must be a first-class wimp!
>>>  She laughs. Dogbert pulls a hose through the window and stands next to the couch holding the nozzle.  Dilbert says to him, <<<
With my blessings.
>>>
1990-06-23 * 
Dogbert covers his eyes with his paws and says, <<<
I'm so embarrassed . . . I dreamed I died and saw the light of God . . .
>>> Dogbert says to Dilbert who is wearing a bathrobe and holding a flashlight, <<<
I trust you will just let this incident pass without comment.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I command you to build an ark . . .
>>>  Dogbert growls.
>>>
1990-06-22 * 
Dilbert enters wearing a bathrobe and shines a flashlight on the chair where Dogbert is sleeping.  Dogbert says in his sleep, <<<
I'm coming toward the light . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
The light . . . It's so pure . . . So perfect . . . It could only be the light of GOD HIMSELF!!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
No.  Just new batteries.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
God has a sense of humor?  Of course!  It explains everything.
>>>
1990-06-21 * 
Dogbert floats through the air thinking, <<<
Uh-oh.  That looks like my body on the ground.
>>> Dogbert thinks, <<<
I must be dead.  And that light . . . It's beautiful . . . It must be GOD!!
>>> The caption says, <<<
Next: a really big let down.
>>>  Dilbert shines a flashlight on Dogbert who is sleeping on the chair.
>>>
1990-06-20 * 
Dogbert says to a dog that looks like a poodle, <<<
Don't worry, Killer, I'll get us out of this pound by nightfall.
>>>  Killer asks, <<<
How?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I used my one phone call to call a wrecking company to destroy this place.
>>>  Killer says, <<<
That sounds dangerous to me.
>>> The caption says, <<<
Coming up: a near-death experience or possibly just a stupid dream sequence.
>>>  An arrow points to Dogbert lying unconscious on top of the rubble of the demolished pound building.
>>>
1990-06-19 * 
Dogbert stands in a cage thinking, <<<
No stupid dog pound can hold me for long.
>>> Dogbert yells to the dog catcher, <<<
Hey, screw!  Don't I get one phone call?!
>>> Dogbert whispers into the telephone, <<<
Hello, is this the Big Ball Demolition Company? . . . Good, I have a rush job for you . . .
>>>
1990-06-18 * 
Dogbert walks down the sidewalk humming.  A man with a gun jumps around the corner and yells, <<<
Freeze!!!  I'm a dog catcher!
>>> The dog catcher says, <<<
What, no collar?  You're going to the puppy penitentiary, pal!
>>> Dogbert sits in a cage next to a dog who looks like a poodle.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Your human turned you in?
>>>  The dog replies, <<<
He didn't think a pit bull should wear his hair this way.
>>>
1990-06-17 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at a desk.  Dilbert says, <<<
I programmed my computer to analyze any situation and predict the female response.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
This should clarify a few things.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I'll type in 'watch sad movie.'
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Result: crying.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Now I'll try 'receive flowers.'  Result: crying.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Let's try 'date with Dilbert.'  Result: crying.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Boy, the truth gets vicious when you corner it.
>>>
1990-06-16 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk working on his computer.  Dilbert says, <<<
One more clever move and I will have written the perfect computer program.
>>> Dilbert throws his arms over his head and yells, <<<
Yes!
>>>  Dogbert yells, <<<
Spike it in the end zone!
>>> Dilbert throws his computer on the ground and breaks it.  Dogbert says, <<<
Another failure of the sports metaphor.
>>>
1990-06-15 * 
Dogbert says to Bob and Dawn the Dinosaurs, <<<
I'm dissolving the cult.  You two are free to do as you please.
>>> Bob and Dawn dance and yell, <<<
We're free!  We're free!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Boy . . . You don't know ugly 'til you've seen dinosaurs dance.
>>>
1990-06-14 * 
Geraldo Rivera holds a microphone and says, <<<
Today on 'Geraldo' our entire show is about a dog who started his own cult!
>>> Dogbert says into the microphone, <<<
Actually, Geraldo, I don't know what you're talking about.
>>> Geraldo faces the camera and smiles.  Dogbert says, <<<
I love live television.
>>>
1990-06-13 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I think you've taken your cult idea too far.
>>>  Dogbert sits in a chair with a crown on his head.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Who says it's a cult?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
YOU said it's a cult!
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
That word has a bad connotation.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I prefer to think of it as a bunch of morons who have nothing better to do with their lives.
>>>
1990-06-12 * 
Bob the Dinosaur says, <<<
Dogbert, we've come to resign from your cult.
>>>  Dawn says, <<<
You can't push us around anymore.
>>>  Dogbert is wearing a crown. Dogbert replies, <<<
Resign?!!  Ha!  You're unworthy!  I kick you out.  The cult doesn't need your type!
>>> Bob begs, <<<
Nooo!!  Take us back!!!  Please!!!
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I think this explains why dinosaurs don't rule the earth.
>>>
1990-06-11 * 
Dilbert says to Dawn and Bob the Dinosaurs, <<<
I have a plan to deprogram you from the control of Dogbert's cult.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
My theory is that the brain reflexively embraces the most ridiculous explanation of reality.
>>> Dilbert concludes, <<<
So, we just have to think of something more ridiculous than following a dog's commands.
>>>  Bob asks, <<<
Like listening to you?
>>>
1990-06-10 * 
Dilbert stands across from the Boss's desk.  The Boss tells Dilbert, <<<
This is a very interesting employee suggestion.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Thank you, sir.
>>> The Boss says, <<<
If I read this correctly . . .
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
You observed that everybody is smarter than his boss . . .
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Exactly . . . So we all just switch jobs with our bosses and boost productivity by 200 percent!!
>>> The Boss says, <<<
I've decided to do a limited trial . . .
>>>  A janitor enters the room and tells Dilbert, <<<
Something died in the stairwell.  Take care of it.
>>>
1990-06-09 * 
Bob the Dinosaur asks Dawn, <<<
How did we ever allow ourselves to be drawn into Dogbert's evil cult?
>>> Bob continues, <<<
Maybe he has strange hypnotic powers.  Maybe we were mesmerized by his oratorical skill.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It says here you have brains the size of a walnut.
>>>  Bob asks, <<<
What's your point?
>>>
1990-06-08 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dawn and Bob the Dinosaurs asks, <<<
Uh . . . Dilbert, could we get your advice?
>>> Bob says, <<<
We just joined Dogbert's new cult.
>>>  Dawn says, <<<
And he ordered us to kill each other for questioning him.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Hmm . . . Maybe you could just shove each other in front of trucks.
>>>
1990-06-07 * 
The caption says, <<<
Bob and Dawn join Dogbert's cult.
>>>  Dogbert says to Bob and Dawn the Dinosaurs, <<<
You two are in charge of security.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Your job is to neutralize anybody who questions my motives.
>>>  Dawn says, <<<
Actually, we have some questions of our own . . .
>>> Dawn asks, <<<
Or should we just neutralize ourselves?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Make it look like an accident.
>>>
1990-06-06 * 
Bob and Dawn the Dinosaurs sit on the floor across from Dogbert.  Bob says, <<<
We heard you're forming a cult.  Can we join?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Hmm . . .
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Yeah . . . I could use some enforcers to help me conceal the hideous and cynical nature of my organization.  You're in . . .
>>> Bob raises his arms over his head and yells, <<<
Yes!  We made it!
>>>  Dawn asks, <<<
Bob, should we ask about the hideous part?
>>>
1990-06-05 * 
A woman sits on the floor across from Dogbert's desk.  The woman says, <<<
I'm hoping you will accept me in the Dogbert Cult.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
You do have a strong resume . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Looks like you've been fleeced by several spiritual leaders already.
>>> The woman says, <<<
I think that demonstrates a complete absence of independent thought.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Can you chant?
>>>
1990-06-04 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert stands on the hassock.  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm going to form a personality cult to honor me.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I'll take everybody's money and make them wear bathrobes with my picture on the back.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Wouldn't it be cheaper to brand them and let them run naked?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
As a rule, we're not talking about attractive people here.
>>>
1990-06-03 * 
Dilbert sits at a table and looks at a stamp through a magnifying glass.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Why do people collect stamps?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Because they're valuable.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Why are they valuable?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Because people collect up all the good ones.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
So, you collect stamps because they're valuable, and they're valuable because you collect them.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Right.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Sounds pretty fulfilling.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
To be honest, I just do it for the adrenalin rush.
>>>
1990-06-02 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the Boss's desk.  The Boss says, <<<
Your new project will be VITAL to the performance of this company!
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Uh-oh.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
The more he talks it up the stupider the project must be.
>>>  The Boss says, <<<
. . . High visibility, a chance to excel and be noticed!
>>> The Boss continues, <<<
In fact, I stand to salute you for the job you will be doing!  You're what makes this country great!!
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Does this have anything to do with the janitors' strike?
>>>
1990-06-01 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I'm just a one-woman kind of guy.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Some guys like to play the field.  Not me.  I'm happy with just one woman.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Just one.  Uno.  That's best for me.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
You can take her for rides in the Space Shuttle you'll never have either.
>>>
1990-05-31 * 
Dogbert looks at a clock on the wall and thinks, <<<
By now Dilbert should have infiltrated Buckingham Palace.
>>> Dogbert thinks, <<<
One kiss from the Princess and his 'frog curse' will be lifted . . . I just hope his disguise works . . .
>>> Inside a tower, Lady Diana asks, <<<
Charlie, why does your breath smell like flies?
>>>  Dilbert the Frog answers, <<<
Uh . . . I had lunch with a common person today . . .
>>>
1990-05-30 * 
The panel says, <<<
Note:  Some new readers of this strip may be confused by the presence of a character who looks very much like a potato.  The following comparison should clear things up:" A caption pointing to a drawing of Dilbert the Frog says, <<<
Dilbert (turned into a frog and disguised as Prince Charles).
>>>  A caption points to a potato. The panel says, <<<
A handy rule for telling which one is a potato is to look for the presence of glasses.  Although potatoes do have eyes, they are know to be vain and generally prefer contact lenses.  Keep this reference guide with you.
>>>
1990-05-29 * 
The caption says, <<<
Dilbert needs a kiss from a princess to remove the frog curse.
>>>  Dilbert the Frog says to Dogbert, <<<
It's hopeless . . .
>>> Dogbert opens the closet door and says, <<<
There's one chance, but we'll need some props.
>>> Dilbert is wearing a crown and a fake nose.  Dilbert asks, <<<
You seriously think this will fool Lady Di?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I'd wait until she's had a few margaritas.
>>>
1990-05-28 * 
Dogbert stands on a chair and Dogbert the Frog sits next to him.  Dogbert says into the telephone, <<<
Hello . . . Buckingham Palace?  I was wondering if the Princess would be willing to kiss a frog and remove a witch's curse for us.
>>> Dogbert says into the phone, <<<
Oh . . . Lady Di does not kiss hideous little creatures . . .
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
That must be mighty awkward at family reunions . . . Hello?
>>>  Dilbert covers his eyes.
>>>
1990-05-27 * 
Dogbert sits at a table holding a document.  He tells Dilbert, <<<
Plans for the corporate takeover are complete.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
What corporate takeover?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
It's a hostile bid for control of the Meowco Cat Food Company.
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
When I become CEO, I'll order them to add a hairball to every can of cat food.
>>>  Dogbert chuckles. Dilbert says, <<<
That is cruel and senseless.  I'm thoroughly ashamed of you.
>>> Dilbert leaves the room.  Dogbert sits on the hassock and thinks, <<<
Gee . . . It seems so much more efficient than hassling one cat at a time.
>>>
1990-05-26 * 
Dilbert the Frog says, <<<
Dogbert, I need your help.  Check my computer to see if there is any way to reverse the spell and make me human!
>>> Dogbert stands on a book on a desk chair and looks at the computer.  Dogbert thinks, <<<
Hmm . . . 'The only way to reverse a frog spell is a kiss from a dog or a princess . . . '" Dilbert asks, <<<
What'd it say?!!
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Gargle, you're gonna visit Lady Di.
>>>
1990-05-25 * 
Dogbert asks Dilbert, <<<
You're back early.  How was your date?
>>> Dilbert, who has been turned into a frog, replies, <<<
Not so good . . . She's a witch . . . Turned me into a frog.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Oooh!  When I think about it I just get so . . . So . . .

Hopping mad?

1990-05-24 * 
Dilbert and a woman sit at a restaurant table eating dinner.  Dilbert asks, <<<
So . . . Uh . . . Why did you decide to take up witchcraft?
>>>  The woman replies, <<<
It comes in handy.
>>> The woman points to a fly circling the table and says, <<<

Of course, I'm not talking about an ORDINARY dish cloth.

Dig, dig . . .

Some women just don't know how to accept a compliment gracefully.

I'm sorry, little guy . . . I don't know how you'll manage without me.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Would it be too much trouble to paint the house before you go?

Dilbert sits on an examining table in a doctor's office.  The doctor says, <<<
Normally I'd give you six months to live.

But we're having a '50&#037; off sale' today, so I'll give you a full year for the same price.
>>> Dilbert lies back on the table.  The doctor says, <<<
And you get an extra ten days if you pay cash!

You what?!
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I got a job as a substitute school teacher.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You aren't qualified to be a teacher.  You're a dog.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Little kids won't know the difference.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You do remind me a bit of my fourth grade teacher.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Just a coincidence?
>>>

Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
You know, many great men kept diaries.

Sorry . . . I forgot where I was.

A man behind a counter at the Department of Dogs says to Dogbert, <<<
I'm sorry, but it seems you've failed the written portion of the dog license test.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Impossible!
>>> The clerk says, <<<
For example, this question on 'natural enemies': the correct answer is 'mailman.'  You wrote in 'fax machine.'" Dilbert asks Dogbert, <<<
How'd it go?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
The 'Department of Dogs' does not keep up with emerging trends.

Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
Maybe since you're full of static electricity, you should say 'it is useless to be a resistor.'  Hee-hee-hee.

They have little 'moist towelettes.'

>>>
1990-01-02 * 
Dilbert sits on the floor by the fireplace.  Dogbert says, <<<

I think YOU will be.

Right.  None of that.

1989-12-30 * 
Dogbert asks Dilbert, <<<
Let me get this straight . . . You say that BAD grammar can become GOOD grammar over time?

Grammar would be a lot less confusing if we had smarter intellectuals.

Good morning!

I wonder if it's normal to want the toll-taker to like me.
>>>
1989-12-22 * 
Dilbert, who is wearing his bathrobe, says, <<<
Dogbert, I can't sleep . . . Do you know any folk remedies?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I recommend spreading grape jelly on your torso and slapping your forehead against an overripe cantaloupe.
>>> Dogbert sits on the hassock watching television.  He hears slapping in the other room and thinks, <<<
This must be how all folk remedies get started.
>>>
1989-12-21 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk working on his computer and Dogbert sits next to him.  Dilbert says, <<<
My computer has determined the funniest words in the world . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
They include: chainsaw, weasel, prune and any reference to 'Gilligan's Island.'  Now I can make my own jokes!

You are too logical.  Use the right side of your brain.

Now it doesn't work AND I want to cry.

1989-12-17 * 
Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
I bought a phone answering machine.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Was the phone asking you questions you couldn't answer on your own?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The hard part is thinking of a greeting message.
>>> Dilbert says into the answering machine, <<<
Hi.  This is Dilbert.  I'm not here right now.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Well, technically I am here 'now' . . .
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
But 'now' is a relative term, so use your best judgment in deciding whether I'm here.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Hmm . . . That was actually a creative little message.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Demonstrating, once again, that subtle difference between creativity and complex stupidity.
>>>

Tomorrow on 'Geraldo,' 'Dust: What's It All Mean?

The caption says, <<<
Dilbert is threatened by an abusive skunk.

That's right: a big bowl of ice cream could keep me from being afraid and reflexively spraying your living room.
>>> As he scoops ice cream into a bowl, Dilbert says angrily, <<<
This is blackmail!
>>>  The skunk says, <<<
My goodness, no.  It's just that I can't control my fear response.
>>> Dilbert kneels down and places the ice cream in front of the skunk.  The skunk says, <<<
Now I'm afraid that you won't sing the songs from 'Cats' while I eat.
>>>
1989-12-14 * 
Dilbert jumps out of his chair and screams, <<<
Yikes!!!  A skunk in the house!!!
>>>  The skunk says, <<<
Hi.
>>> The skunk says as he twitches his tail, <<<
Oh, don't worry; we skunks only spray when we're scared . . . I certainly wouldn't use my threatening power to force you to do my bidding.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Then why is your tail twitching?!
>>>  The skunk replies, <<<
I'm scared you might not offer me a big bowl of strawberry ice cream.
>>>
1989-12-13 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit outdoors.  Dilbert says, <<<
Some say it is man's ability to reason which separates him from mere animals.

Yeah, but . . .

That's a fully functional prototype, so don't mess with it.
>>> Dogbert picks up the phone and says, <<<
So, Gorby, I understand you've been finger-painting with your forehead . . .
>>>
1989-12-10 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at a table.  Dilbert says, <<<
Be honest, Dogbert.  Do you think I'm a gifted inventor . . .

Well . . . Uh . . . I think . . .
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
In my mind, you are the 'tube sock of inventors.'

Sometimes I get the urge to break into the post office at night and lick all the stamps.

Then I would see how long I can stick to the wall by my tongue.
>>>
1989-12-06 * 
Dogbert says to the garbage man, <<<
I understand you're the world's smartest garbage man.

Dilbert and three people sit at a conference table.  A man asks, <<<

Dilbert and Dogbert sit outdoors.  Dogbert says, <<<
I have a stupid question . . .

See . . . Now there's a stupid question.

Quick, quick!  Give me your hand!!!

Dilbert sits in his chair reading the newspaper and Dogbert sits on his legs.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Did I ever tell you what dogs believe about the universe?
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
We believe in infinite parallel universes, all slightly different.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
For example, in our universe, Vincent Van Gogh cut his ear off to demonstrate his love for a woman.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
But, in a parallel universe, Van Gogh loses the ear in a tragic toe-nail clipping accident . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
. . . Vinnie clips the nail, and it just goes flyin' up and rips his ear clean off.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
In yet another universe, maybe he had a dog who talked his ear off.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
This is why dogs rarely discuss their beliefs.
>>>

Dilbert and Dogbert sit outdoors.  Dilbert says, <<<
I've been considering acupuncture as a way to relieve stress.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
The theory here is that sticking large needles into your body will help you relax?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
It sounds silly when YOU say it.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Sometimes sarcasm helps us think more clearly.
>>>
1989-11-24 * 
Dilbert stands in the kitchen and Dogbert stands in the doorway holding a slingshot.  Dilbert reaches for a box of donuts and thinks, <<<
Maybe just one donut before bed.
>>>  Dogbert thinks, <<<
He takes the bait.
>>> Dilbert looks surprised as the donut is shot out of his hand. Dilbert asks Dogbert, <<<
Didn't I ask you to stop playing 'Wild Kingdom' in the house?
>>>  Dogbert thinks, <<<
Now angered, the engineer turns to charge.
>>>
1989-11-23 * 
Dilbert says to a little figure, <<<
Well, if you're my ego, I order you to get back inside me.
>>> The ego replies, <<<
You don't seem to understand who's in charge here.  Without me, you're NOTHING!
>>> Dilbert pulls his tie and says, <<<
I do feel a bit insecure . . .
>>>  The ego says, <<<
Now dance for me, ha ha ha, dance!
>>>
1989-11-22 * 
Dilbert looks down at a small figure and says, <<<
Yikes!  What are you?!
>>>  The figure replies, <<<
Do not panic.  I am your ego.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
My ego?? . . . Shouldn't you be inside me someplace?
>>>  The ego replies, <<<
Well, yes, normally we egos feed within the body.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
So what the heck are you doing out here?
>>>  The ego replies, <<<
You're starving me, man.  I'm going to try out for a play or something.
>>>
1989-11-21 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit outdoors.  Dilbert says, <<<
Okay then, suppose you had everything you wanted.  What would you do?
>>> Dogbert answers, <<<
Gloat.  Make everybody else feel like failures.  Live a garish and decadent life.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
And when that gets boring?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Maybe start my own perfume company.
>>>
1989-11-20 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair reading the newspaper and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dilbert says, <<<
Here's an interesting editorial . . .
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
This guy says we should increase the pay of congressmen to remove incentive for them to engage in illegal acts.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
By that theory, criminals aren't bad, just underpaid.
>>>
1989-11-19 * 
Dilbert jogs through the park wearing a sweat suit and sneakers. Dogbert sits in the chair.  He asks, <<<
How was your run?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Great . . . I feel awful.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Pardon a simple dog for asking, but why do you run if it feels awful?
>>> Dilbert answers, <<<
Well, if I do it every day, I'll live a longer life.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
So, life will feel awful, but at least it will last a long time.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Unless I get hit by a truck . . .
>>>
1989-11-18 * 
The Boss gestures toward the man standing next to him and says to Dilbert, <<<
Dilbert, let me introduce you to our new engineer.

I hate introductions.  I always forget their names.  Maybe I can use a word association memory trick.
>>> The man holds out his hand and says, <<<
Hi, I'm Dee Alamo.
>>>  Dilbert reaches to shake his hand and thinks, <<<
Darn . . . Nothing.
>>>
1989-11-17 *

Shave the whales.

Dilbert walks down a hallway thinking, <<<
Uh oh . . . Double doors.  One side is always locked and I make a fool of myself trying to open it.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Which side is it?  Left?  Right?  People are watching.  Think, think . . .
>>> Dilbert arrives at home looking dirty and disheveled.  Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
That's when I noticed that the ventilation ducts were big enough for a human to crawl through.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Too bad they didn't lead to outside.
>>>
1989-11-15 * 
The caption says, <<<
Dogbert continues his reckless experiment with the powerful force of 'affirmations.'"  Dilbert watches Dogbert write on a piece of paper and asks, <<<
. . . What if this actually works?
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Can you really cause me to be eaten by a garden slug just by writing it down over and over?
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
What am I saying?  Logically, there's no way this could work.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Don't get too far from salt.
>>>
1989-11-14 * 
Dogbert stands at a desk writing on a piece of paper.  Dilbert asks, <<<
What's all the writing for?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
It's called 'affirmations.'" Dogbert explains, <<<
The theory is that if you write down your objective fifteen times a day, the objective will be achieved, no matter how unlikely.
>>> Dilbert reads the affirmation and says, <<<
But you've written 'Dilbert will be eaten by a garden slug.'"  Dogbert replies, <<<
It's all I could think of.
>>>
1989-11-13 * 
Dilbert stands at a counter talking to a police officer.  Dilbert, who has a bump on his head, says, <<<
I was mugged, but I got a good look at him.
>>>  The officer says, <<<
I'll get a police artist.
>>> Dilbert and the police artist sit at a table.  The artist sketches as Dilbert says, <<<
. . . A big head, and kind of a frightened expression . . .
>>> Dilbert looks at the drawing and says, <<<
Perfect.  Looks just like me.  Now let's do the mugger.  He was sort of off to the left here.
>>>
1989-11-12 * 
Dilbert sneezes on Dogbert. Dogbert sniffles and says, <<<
Great.  Now I've got your cold.
>>> Dogbert leaves the room and says, <<<
I'll get some medicine from the store.
>>> Dogbert walks down the sidewalk and sneezes.  A man walking by says, <<<
Hi, Dogbert.
>>> The man sneezes.  Dogbert says, <<<
Sorry . . . Dilbert's cold.
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert sit on the chair watching television.  The newscaster says, <<<
. . . And seven nations are paralyzed by what is being called 'Dilbert's cold.'"  Dilbert says, <<<
Gosh.  I think I might have that, too.
>>>
1989-11-11 * 
Dilbert and a woman sit at a table in a restaurant.  Dilbert thinks as he reaches for the check, <<<
All of us cosmopolitan guys use credit cards to pay for dinner.
>>> Dilbert looks at the receipt and thinks, <<<
Uh-oh . . . I never know which part of the paperwork to keep.  I know something gets ripped up . . .
>>> Back at home, Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
. . . And by the time I noticed the tablecloth was tangled up with the carbon paper, I had ripped both of them to bits.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
And that's wrong?
>>>
1989-11-10 * 
Dilbert walks down the sidewalk.  A man walking toward him says, <<<
Hey, how are you?  What's happenin'?
>>> The man says, <<<
Good to see you.  I'm fine.  Great, great.  Take care.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I guess there was no real need for me to participate in that.
>>>
1989-11-09 * 
Dilbert approaches a man holding a door open and thinks, <<<
I wish this guy wouldn't try to be polite and hold the door.
>>> Dilbert reaches for the door and thinks, <<<
I'm at that awkward distance where I should lunge forward so he doesn't have to hold the door too long.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Oh, thank you.
>>> The man says as he walks away, <<<
Great, now I'm late.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I lunged as fast as I could.  Sorry.
>>>
1989-11-08 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I've decided it's time to stop talking about world hunger and start DOING something!
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Let others debate policies.  My time to act is now.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
You're going to buy a smarmy bumper sticker, aren't you?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Darn straight.
>>>
1989-11-07 * 
A large man enters Dilbert's cubicle and says, <<<
Yo, Dilbert, give me your lunch money or I'll erase your data diskettes.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Touch my data and I'll erase any mention of you from the main payroll computer.
>>>  Beads of sweat flies from the man's head and he says, <<<
No . . . Please, I'm sorry.
>>> Dilbert turns toward the reader and says, <<<
Nothing is more pathetic than an aging school bully.
>>>  The man says, <<<
I took shop; I can make you some nice bookends.
>>>
1989-11-06 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk writing and Dogbert watches him.  Dilbert says, <<<
I'm writing a poem for a woman I just met.  Women love poems.
>>> Dilbert reads the poem entitled, <<<
Your Legs.
>>> Dilbert reads, <<<
How wonderful your legs are, / You can even ask my mutt . . .
>>> Dilbert continues to read, <<<
'Cause if you didn't have 'em, / the ground would hit your butt.
>>>
1989-11-05 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert walk down the sidewalk.  A man walking in the other direction says, <<<
Hi, Dilbert.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Hi, Frank.
>>> The man says, <<<
My name is Eddy, not Frank.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Oh . . . Right.  Sorry, Eddy.
>>>  Dilbert thinks, <<<
This is so embarrassing.
>>> Eddy says, <<<
Forgetting somebody's name is the worst insult in the world.
>>> Eddy continues, <<<
Now my self-esteem has been damaged.  My job performance will drop accordingly, and I'll be fired.
>>> Eddy shivers and says, <<<
The stress is starting to affect my immune system.  I'm getting a cold.
>>>  Dogbert holds out his paw and says, <<<
I'm Dogbert.  Nice to meet you, Frank.
>>>
1989-11-04 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit on a fence outdoors.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Isn't it stupid that the world economy is based on gold?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Yeah . . . No matter how advanced civilization gets, we still use rocks for money.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
The dumb part is using a rock that's so hard to find.
>>>
1989-11-03 * 
Dilbert leans over a table looking at a glass container.  Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
My terrarium experiment is a failure.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
By now it should have started its own self-contained weather patterns.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
After all this waiting, it's just so . . . so . . .
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Anti-climatic?
>>>
1989-11-02 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit outdoors.  Dilbert says, <<<
And another of life's mysteries is, why do they call it the 'Great Wall of China?'" Dilbert continues, <<<
It never really kept any invading armies out . . . Kind of a dismal flop from an engineering perspective.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I don't think 'The Dismal Flop of China' would have the same tourist appeal.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I wouldn't pay to see it.
>>>
1989-11-01 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair watching television.  The voice on the tv says, <<<
Tonight Siskel and Ebert review Dilbert's life.
>>> Ebert says, <<<
. . . Boring and stupid . . . Look out, Gene; I'm gonna have to spit to get the taste out of my mouth . . .
>>> Ebert continues, <<<
Oops.  Sorry, Gene.
>>>  Dilbert points the remote control at the tv and changes the channel as he says, <<<
I hate when they do these theme shows.
>>>
1989-10-31 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
Helen just canceled our date.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
What excuse this time?
>>> Dilbert sits on the hassock with Dogbert and answers, <<<
Apparently she discovered tiny frozen cavemen in her ice cube trays and she's trying to revive them for science.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Are you the least bit suspicious of that story?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Yeah . . . How do I know they aren't just pretending to be cavemen?
>>>
1989-10-30 * 
Dilbert kills a fly with a fly swatter.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Why is it okay to kill flies but not okay to kill dolphins?
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Is the poor fly any less deserving of our respect and protection?
>>> Dilbert raises the fly swatter and says, <<<
Hold still . . . There's a dolphin on your forehead.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I've added the A.S.P.C.A. to our speed dialer.
>>>
1989-10-29 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
They were rude to me at the bank again, Dogbert.
>>> Dilbert points to the door and says, <<<
I've had enough . . . Sic 'em, boy!!
>>> Dogbert walks into the bank. Dogbert tells a woman, <<<
Hi.  I'm David Packard; billionaire founder of Hewlett-Packard.
>>> Dogbert sits at the woman's desk and continues, <<<
. . . And I'd like to put all of my money into one of your non-interest bearing accounts.
>>>  The woman replies, <<<
You're not David Packard.  You're just a dreadful little dog with glasses.
>>> The woman says, <<<
Then again . . . I've never seen a picture of David Packard . . . I'd better open the account.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Very good.  Now give me fifty push-ups or I'll take my business elsewhere.
>>>
1989-10-28 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at a table.  Dogbert says, <<<
Scientists have discovered the gene that makes some people love golf.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How can they tell it's the golf gene?
>>> Dogbert answers, <<<
It's plaid and it lies.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
I probably shouldn't rely on you for my science updates.
>>>
1989-10-27 * 
Dilbert sits on the bank of a stream and casts a fishing pole into the water.  Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
It's just man against fish out here, my friend.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Although it's a bit of a mismatch, with my superior brain, equipment and strength.
>>> Dogbert stands on the bank and says, <<<
Boy, all that and he can water-ski, too.
>>>
1989-10-26 * 
Dilbert pushes a shopping cart through a grocery store.  A clerk says, <<<
Hold it right there, fella!
>>> Dilbert turns around and says, <<<
Uh-oh . . . You must have seen me eat that grape in aisle 'B.'"  The clerk responds, <<<
I just want to make sure you pay for it.
>>> Dilbert lies on the scale at the cash register.  The clerk says, <<<
Looks like 192 pounds.  What were you before you came in?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Happy.
>>>
1989-10-25 * 
Dilbert walks down the hall thinking, <<<
Sometimes I feel like a kid in an adult's body, hoping nobody notices.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
It's as if I stopped maturing and just started faking it after age fourteen.
>>> Dilbert passes a woman and thinks, <<<
I'll bet women never feel that way.
>>>  The woman thinks, <<<
Cooties.
>>>
1989-10-24 * 
Dogbert sits on a pillow and thinks, <<<
Maybe I should write a book.
>>> Dogbert thinks, <<<
Nah . . . Maybe I should just read a book.
>>> Dogbert thinks as he walks through the house, <<<
Maybe I'll just read the tv guide . . . Maybe I'll just watch whatever's on and turn into pudding . . .
>>>
1989-10-23 * 
Dilbert sits on the floor hugging his knees and watching television.  Dogbert says, <<<
You've been watching this video tape over and over for days.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
These tennis instruction tapes are great.  I can just feel my game improving as I watch.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
In fact, I see no need to actually physically play the game ever again.
>>>
1989-10-22 * 
Dogbert and Dilbert sit at a table.  The doorbell rings and Dilbert says, <<<
Dogbert, see who's at the door.
>>> A man tells Dogbert, <<<
Hi.  I'm from the 'Big Ball Wrecking Company.'  I have a work order to destroy this house.
>>> Dogbert reads the order and syas, <<<
Looks like you have the wrong address.  This is Walnut AVENUE.  Walnut STREET is clear across town.
>>> The man says, <<<
Oh phlegm!  I don't have time to drive way over there.
>>> The man asks, <<<
Would it be a bother if I just leveled this house instead?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
That would be a tad inconvenient.  Try the Johnsons, next door.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What was that loud noise?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Apparently the Johnsons aren't home.
>>>
1989-10-21 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit outdoors.  Dilbert asks, <<<
You know what I hate?
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
What?
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
I hate it when hundreds of people get together and throw a surprise birthday party for me.
>>> Dogbert responds, <<<
It's amazing how nature protects us from the things we hate.
>>>
1989-10-20 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dogbert says, <<<
I've been thinking how wonderful it would be if all people renounced violence forever.
>>> Dilbert turns around and says, <<<
That's a beautiful thought, Dogbert.

If nobody else was violent, I could conquer the whole stupid planet with just a butter knife.
>>>
1989-10-19 * 
Dogbert sits in a chair and Dilbert stands in front of him.  Dilbert asks, <<<
If I died tomorrow, what would you write on my tombstone?

I always assumed there would be no tombstone.

Ah . . . You would have me cremated.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Or stuffed, whichever is cheaper.
>>>
1989-10-18 * 
Dilbert sits at a desk writing a letter.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Who are you writing to?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
My uncle Max, the policeman.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You can't write to a cop on regular size paper!  You have to use legal size paper!
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Don't panic.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I get it -- he looks the other way for family members.
>>>  Dilbert says as he puts money in the envelope, <<<
I send a bribe.
>>>
1989-10-17 *

What's this little piece of paper?

I couldn't take it anymore . . .
>>>

I won WHAT?!!

I won the lottery!  We're millionaires, Dogbert!!

Drinks for everybody!

1989-10-14 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit outdoors under a tree.  Dilbert asks, <<<
Do you ever think about how delicate the balance of nature is?
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Just one little change in our environment and we're all dead.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Yeah . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Suppose everybody stopped throwing rice at weddings and started throwing potatoes.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
It's too horrible to imagine.
>>>
1989-10-13 * 
Dilbert sits at a desk working on his computer.  Dilbert says, <<<
There . . . I've plotted Jenny Dworkin's normal speed, habits and tendencies into my computer.
>>> Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
Now I'll be able to predict her location and bump into her as if by chance.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Why don't you just call her, say you like her and ask her out?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
No.  That would seem too contrived.
>>>
1989-10-12 * 
Dilbert asks Dogbert, <<<
Care to join me for a walk?
>>>  Dogbert answers, <<<
Sure.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I hope you aren't planning to chew that gum at the same time.
>>>  Dilbert says as he puts a piece of gum in his mouth, <<<
Very funny.

So, since Columbus is dead, you have no evidence that the earth is round.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Look . . .

You can ask Senator John Glenn.  He orbited the earth when he was an astronaut.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
So, your theory depends on the honesty of politicians . . .

Yes . . . No, wait . . .
>>>
1989-10-09 * 
Dogbert sits at a desk looking at a flattened globe.  Dilbert asks, <<<
You joined the 'Flat Earth Society?'" Dogbert replies, <<<
I believe the earth MUST be flat.  There is no good evidence to support the so-called 'round earth theory.'

I think Christopher Columbus would disagree.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
How convenient that your best witness is long dead.
>>>
1989-10-08 * 
Dilbert taps on the doorstep with a spade.  He tells Dogbert, <<<
My new security system is now installed.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
How's it work?
>>> Dilbert explains, <<<
I buried a giant spring under the welcome mat to catapult any undesirables into the Wilsey's pool three blocks from here.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
You just tap that little button on the floor there . . .
>>> The caption says, <<<
Time stands still as Dogbert ponders the gift that fate has given him.

What were his EXACT words?

Maybe you'll mutate into something smarter.

Boink-ouch!  Boink-ouch!  Boink-ouch!

Dilbert asks Phil, the Ruler of Heck, <<<
Then . . . I won't be damned?

Just 'darned.'  It was a misdemeanor.

I'm sorry, Dogbert.  I brought this upon us.

What's my penalty?  Eternal damnation?

I'm just going to 'darn you' for fifteen minutes.
>>>
1989-10-03 * 
Dilbert stands in the kitchen looking at a grocery receipt and thinking, <<<
Looks like they under-charged me twelve cents on the lettuce.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I should go back and give them the twelve cents.  But I'm sure they would tell me to keep it for being so honest.
>>> Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light and the Ruler of Heck, shows up at the door and says to Dogbert, <<<
. . . I have a report of a flimsy rationalization in progress.

You forgot to put a stamp on it.

Dilbert sits in his chair with Dogbert sitting on his legs.  Dogbert says, <<<
My instinct tells me that love is in the air.
>>>  There's a loud crash behind them. Dilbert and Dogbert walk to the window where a little angel sits on the floor in a pile of broken glass.  The angel says, <<<
Whoa!  Who put the picture window there?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
You must be the legendary love-cherub, 'Cupid.'"  Cupid replies, <<<
Good guess . . .
>>> The angel continues, <<<
But the proper pronunciation is 'STupid,' not 'Cupid.'
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
No wonder I always fall in love with the wrong person.
>>>  Cupid struggles with his bow and arrow.  He says, <<<
Now how does this gizmo work?
>>>

Dogbert sits on a pillow thinking, <<<
I should keep myself busier.

Which means you die sooner.  I better sit right here.

I was quite the little rebel when I was a kid.

Flashback.

Potato salad again?  I've GOT to speak out on this issue.

Dogbert walks down a sidewalk and a man in a trenchcoat says, <<<
Pssst . . . Comrade Dogsky.  Will you sell your master's electronic secrets to nice Soviet man?
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Will you be wanting them on microfiche or hard copy?
>>> Back at home, Dilbert asks, <<<
You're going to cripple the WHAT?
>>>  Dogbert, who is carrying plans, replies, <<<
Evil empire.  Trust me on this.
>>>
1989-09-26 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the dresser mirror adjusting his tie and Dogbert sits on the bed watching him.  Dogbert says, <<<
The best way to impress women at the party is to just act naturally.
>>> Dilbert walks though a party thinking, <<<
Act naturally, act naturally.
>>> Back at home, Dilbert says, <<<
Logically, it is impossible to 'act' naturally.

Most great advice doesn't hold under scrutiny.

Dogbert sits on a pillow listening to the radio.  Dilbert says, <<<
Dogbert, I'd like to have a word with you.

The neighbor says you glued little suction cups on their new kitten and stuck him on their windshield.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
What's the problem, some kind of copyright infringement?
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
What's your second guess?
>>>
1989-09-24 * 
Dilbert shows Dogbert a device that looks like a handle.  He says, <<<
This is my newest invention: the deodorant spray booster pack!

You connect it to any can of deodorant to boost the rate of output.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Why?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Why?! . . . Do you know how much time is wasted waiting for the spray to hit your armpit?
>>> Dilbert activates the device and it blows him through the wall. Dilbert lies on his back in the backyard.  He says, <<<
As my best friend, I'm sure you can contain any sarcastic references to deodorant until my bones mend.

No sweat.
>>>
1989-09-23 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the table drinking coffee.  Dilbert says, <<<
I'm so mad at myself this morning.

Last night I dreamed I met a beautiful woman.

So what's the problem?

I forgot to get her phone number.

Hey, Dogbert, you want to go camping this weekend?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Why don't we just sleep in the garage, eat bugs and not take showers.
>>> Dilbert puts his hands on his hips and says, <<<
That is COMPLETELY different from camping, for reasons which will come to me.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Because we might not get lost?
>>>
1989-09-21 * 
A man at a desk says to Dilbert, <<<
Well, Dilbert, you seem qualified for this promotion, but I have one concern.  Since your work would be evaluated by many people . . .
>>> The man asks, <<<
Can you handle criticism?
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Oh, easily.  For example, your toupee looks like a mule-stomped gopher . . .
>>> Back at home, Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
. . . Turns out it was a trick question.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Boy, you can't trust those bald guys.
>>>
1989-09-20 * 
Dilbert lies on a couch in a psychologist's office.  The therapist says, <<<
. . . So it's clear that your fear of moths derives from your insecurity about your looks.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Really?
>>> The psychiatrist says, <<<
I'm sure you're aware that those big floppy ears of yours make your head look like a winged insect in flight.
>>> The doctor continues, <<<
Now, is it possible that your mother was a giant moth in disguise?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Well, I lost a sweater once; maybe she ate it.
>>>
1989-09-19 * 
Dilbert lies on a couch in a psychiatrist's office.  As the therapist takes notes, Dilbert says, <<<
. . . And it seems like I've always been afraid of moths . . .
>>> The psychologist asks, <<<
Could this fear be related to your insecurity about your looks?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I've never been insecure about my looks . . .

Until this moment . . .

Now we're getting someplace.
>>>
1989-09-18 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dogbert asks, <<<
You know what kind of music I hate?

Heavy metal rock?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Opera.

1989-09-17 * 
Dilbert is scuba diving under the ocean.  He photographs a whale and a squid.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Wow!  These pictures will prove that whales try to communicate with squids!

Dogbert, guess who I saw talking to a squid.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Who?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
I have prints of whales.
>>>  Dogbert thinks, <<<
The Prince of Wales?
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
It's too bad I'm so modest.  This discovery could make me famous.
>>>  Dogbert thinks, <<<
The public must be told.
>>> Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on the hassock.  A television newscaster says, <<<
. . . And in the news, a local man has witnessed Prince Charles talking to a squid.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Maybe Chuck thought it was Margaret Thatcher.
>>>
1989-09-16 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Did you ever get to thinking that maybe you are just an android, placed on earth by an advanced civilization of huge radish-like aliens who are studying your every move?

No.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Me neither.
>>>
1989-09-15 * 
Dilbert walks down the hallway thinking, <<<
Oh, crap.  This is the third time today that I will walk by this same guy in the hall.  I barely know him.
>>> Dilbert continues thinking, <<<
This is so awkward.  The first time, I said 'hello.'  The second time we both made those closed-mouth grins and arched our eyebrows.  What do I do the third time?
>>> Back at home, Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
. . . So I pulled the fire alarm.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I don't think Miss Manners is gonna back you on this one.
>>>
1989-09-14 * 
Dilbert reads a piece of mail and says, <<<
Wow!  And I thought this was just more junk mail!
>>> Dilbert sits in his chair and says to Dogbert, <<<
All I have to do is drive two hours and listen to their condo sales pitch.  I'm GUARANTEED to win a Jeep Cherokee or a valuable mock emerald.

That emerald will go pretty well with your mock brain.
>>>
1989-09-13 * 
Dogbert stands on a desk chair and types, <<<
To his horror, Dilbert discovers that all of his white socks have holes.  'My goodness!' he cries, 'I shall be forced to wear black socks to work.'" Dogbert continues typing, <<<
'If only my pants reached the tops of my shoes, then the other engineers might not notice,' Dilbert despaired.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
What are you writing?
>>> Dogbert turns around and answers, <<<
It's a 'geek' tragedy.
>>>

Dilbert and Dogbert crouch behind a bush and look through binoculars.  Dogbert says, <<<
Whoa!  Looks like we got a pippin hawk, a prickly beak mud swallow, and a bald eagle.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Robin.

How is it that you have spotted 1,700 exotic birds this morning, and all I have seen is one robin?

Look!  A monkey-faced disco hawk!!
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
Where?!
>>>
1989-09-11 * 
Dilbert looks down at a water fountain and says, <<<
I hate this . . . When I'm really thirsty, there always seems to be some disgusting public fountain to taunt me.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
No doubt this thing is crawling with cooties, and I'll have to wrap my lips around it to slurp the water out.
>>> The fountain says, <<<
Hey, I'm not too thrilled about you, either.
>>>
1989-09-10 * 
Dogbert sits at the table reading a book.  Dilbert says, <<<
You've been reading that World Almanac for hours.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I'm looking for nations I can conquer on a limited budget.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Here's one: 'Andorra.  185 square miles.  Only 56,000 people.  Joint rule by France and Spain . . .'
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Hmm . . . 'King Dogbert of Andorra' has a nice ring to it.  Now I just need some mercenaries.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
How are you going to pay for mercenaries?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I'll float some junk bonds until we can loot the treasury of Andorra.

It strikes me as a bit unethical.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Apparently I'll have to imprison some dissidents.
>>>
1989-09-09 * 
Dilbert drives his car and thinks, <<<
Oh no . . . I always get stuck behind a truck carrying stuff that could fall off and crack my windshield.

I suppose I'm being a little irrational about this.

Still, it's hard to shake the feeling.
>>>
1989-09-08 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at a table playing Scrabble.  Dogbert arranges his letters and says, <<<
That spells 'neans.'  Five points for me.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
'Neans' is NOT a word, Dogbert.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
I know, but I need to get rid of some n's.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
The n's don't justify the 'neans.'"  Dogbert says, <<<
I just wanted to hear you say that.
>>>
1989-09-07 * 
Dilbert swings at a ping pong ball and misses as it bounces off the ping pong table. Dilbert says, <<<
You win, again.  I sure wish I knew how you make that shot.
>>>  His opponent answers, <<<
Supernatural forces.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Really?  Supernatural?
>>>  Dogbert whispers, <<<
The mental game is SO important.
>>>
1989-09-06 * 
Dilbert stands in front of a man's desk holding a gadget.  The man asks, <<<
So, Dilbert, this is the prototype you've been working on for the last six months?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Yes, sir.  I'm proud to say that this baby can transform worthless pocket lint into a valuable parsley substitute!
>>> The man says, <<<
Well, this looks absolutely brilliant and completely unmarketable.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Thanks, I'm technology driven.
>>>
1989-09-05 * 
Dilbert walks through the cafeteria holding a tray of food.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Oh no, not this cashier again.  She always hands back my change right over my soda.  I just know she's trying to make me drop a dime in my drink.
>>> Dilbert stands at the cashier and waves his hand over his drink saying, <<<
No!  No!  No!
>>>  The cashier thinks, <<<
Fake left . . .
>>> Dilbert says as he eats his lunch, <<<
It's not the coins in the soda that get me; it's that darned celebration dance she does.
>>>
1989-09-04 * 
Dogbert stands at a table wearing a chef's hat.  He says to Dilbert, <<<
You're just in time to taste my new cake.

Yum.

Great cake, but shouldn't it have frosting?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Oh no!  Frosting is very bad for you.
>>> Dilbert walks away saying, <<<
Gee, I never knew that frosting was bad for me.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
That's why I licked it all off.
>>>
1989-09-03 * 
The caption says, <<<
To the ancients it was known as the 'Time of Degauss.'"  Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on the hassock. The caption says, <<<
Every thousand years, the animal magnetism of domesticated creatures reverses.
>>>  Dogbert's ears fly up. The caption says, <<<
The result can be catastrophic . . .
>>>  Silverware flies out of a drawer and the toaster flies off the shelf. The caption says, <<<
. . . Or dogastrophic.
>>>  Dogbert runs away from the flying metal objects that are attracted by his magnetism. Dogbert runs through Dilbert's legs. The caption says, <<<
Soon the field stabilizes, and the threat is forgotten.
>>>  The silverware pins Dilbert to the wall.  Dogbert says, <<<
That reminds me - what's for supper tonight?
>>>
1989-09-02 * 
Dilbert holds up a chart and says to Dogbert, <<<
On this graph, I have plotted the frequency of snide comments that you have made about me.  I'm happy to report that the recent trend is downward.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
See the big dip?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Get out your pencil . . .
>>>
1989-09-01 * 
Dogbert and Dilbert sit at a table.  Dogbert asks, <<<
How do you like your new book - 'The History of Glue?'" Dilbert replies, <<<
I couldn't put it down.
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert look at each other.
>>>
1989-08-31 * 
Dilbert walks into Wally's Laundry. The person behind the counter says, <<<
We accidentally ruined your shirts - so we added a little glue and wrapped them around a stick.
>>> Dilbert arrives at home carrying a shirt wrapped around a stick.  Dogbert says, <<<
Granted, it was good initiative, but in my view, it was not a tipping situation.
>>>
1989-08-30 * 
Dilbert approaches the mailbox saying, <<<
Oh, please, please, please . . .
>>> Dilbert opens the mailbox and says, <<<
Yay!  It's here!
>>> Dilbert walks away carrying a piece of bread.  Dilbert says, <<<
Nothing quite matches the thrill of the 'Toast of the Month Club!'
>>>
1989-08-29 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert who is sitting in his chair, <<<
Don't get too close to my lab today.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Why not?
>>> Dilbert answers, <<<
I'm using radiation to mutate new species of vegetables.

Isn't that dangerous?

Funny, the broccoli asked me the same question.
>>>
1989-08-28 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert, who is wearing a magician's hat, sit on pillows with a glass ball between them.  Dilbert says, <<<
I don't understand how you can become a certified swami by mail in three weeks.

Eventually, you will die . . .

They fed me only flannel and water, and mined my pockets twice a day.

Thank God it was only a dream . . .

Only a dream?  Maybe you should check your pockets.

Lint!!
>>>  Dogbert looks at the reader and says, <<<
Stranger than fiction.
>>>
1989-08-26 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit outdoors.  Dilbert says, <<<
According to Einstein, time slows down as you approach the speed of light.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Didn't he also prove that time flies when you're having fun?
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
So, if you walk slower, do you have more fun or just get more light?  Were we finished here?
>>>  Dilbert is gone.
>>>
1989-08-25 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk holding up a broken ruler.  Dilbert asks Dogbert, <<<

I just KNOW there is some flaw in that argument . . .

Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dogbert says, <<<
You shouldn't care so much about what other people think of your work.

I mean, everybody scoffed at the Wright Brothers.  Galileo was jailed.  Columbus was ridiculed.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
'Course, none of those guys had a head shaped like a torpedo.

1989-08-23 * 
The caption says, <<<
And while he had just created undoubtedly the finest memo known to man, still Dilbert felt curiously unfulfilled.

Maybe it needs more 'CC's.'
>>> The caption says, <<<
Sadly, not everybody would share Dilbert's vision.
>>>  Dogbert reads the memo and asks, <<<
Do you really think staples can be straightened and reused?

Dogbert and Dilbert sit at a table.  The doorbell rings. Dilbert opens the door and a bear says, <<<
Hi.  I'm the bear skin rug you ordered by mail.
>>> The bear enters the house and says, <<<
I'm a kit.  You just have to kill me, rip my guts out and leave me to dry.
>>>  Dilbert looks shocked. Dilbert covers his eyes and says, <<<
Egad!  I couldn't possibly do that.  Please . . . Just go.
>>> The bear says, <<<
You'll receive a full refund, of course.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
No, no!  Please keep it.
>>> The bear, who is really a man in a bear suit, walks into the rug store.  A man at a desk asks, <<<
How were sales today?
>>>  The man in the suit replies, <<<
Great!  Sold myself seven times.

Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
My new invention can calculate the odds of any event.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
What are the odds that I care?
>>> Dilbert looks at the device he is holding and says, <<<
Hmm . . . It says 'Same as the odds of being asked to burp the greatest hits of Barry Manilow at Carnegie Hall . . .'" Dilbert continues reading the display, <<<
'. . . And having NBC buy the story rights and turn it into a docudrama.'"  Dogbert says, <<<
Bingo.

1989-08-17 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit outdoors under a tree.  Dogbert says, <<<
If a man eats a pound of pasta and a pound of antipasto . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
. . . Would they cancel each other out, leaving the man still hungry?

I can't imagine Socrates and Plato debating that question.

Too hard, huh?
>>>
1989-08-16 * 
Dogbert sits on a pillow listening to a radio news broadcast.  The newscaster says, <<<
Critics continued their accusations that the management of Megaslime Corporation is made up of reptilian aliens from another planet.
>>> The newscaster continues, <<<
A company spokesman offered to eat a bug and not enjoy it, thus proving they are not reptilian.
>>> The newscaster continues, <<<
Critics responded by insisting on a live gerbil instead of a bug.  Merv Griffin announced that he would launch a new game show based on the concept.

The man is a visionary.
>>>
1989-08-15 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair watching a television news report.  The newscaster says, <<<

Let's try it.

>>> Dogbert says, <<<
No doubt you've considered the valuable uses for the brick itself.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Uh . . . Right . . . For home construction?
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Or just as an immovable object that smells like Sylvester Stallone's socks.
>>>
1989-08-12 * 
Dilbert puts a coin in a newspaper machine and thinks, <<<
Sometimes I get this wicked urge to take two newspapers and only pay for one.

Thief!

Great!  I learned the secret handshake tonight.

You stick your hand out and spin it around like this.

Then what?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Then you just keep on doing it forever.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
That explains why you keep it secret.
>>>
1989-08-10 * 
Dilbert stands next to a device and Dogbert sits on a stool.  Dilbert says, <<<
My new invention will generate a solid particle bridge to permanently connect the earth to the moon!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Well, I'm no scientist, but won't that disrupt the earth's orbit and cause an ice age that will destroy all life on this planet?
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
You think it needs a little warning label?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Just don't let kids use it.
>>>

I do NOT snore, and I do NOT believe you made this recording of me last night.

I'm not buying this.
>>>

Bob and Dawn the Dinosaurs sit on the floor in front of Dilbert's chair.  Dilbert says, <<<
. . . So the theory that dinosaurs were destroyed when a giant meteor collided with earth . . .

. . . Was highly exaggerated.

Ha ha, Larry!  Ha ha!

Ouch!

Dogbert stands inside the house looking out the window.  A bird flies into the window and bounces off. The bird knocks on the door. Dogbert answers the door and the bird says, <<<
Excuse me, mammal.  Would you please lower your invisible force field so I can fly through?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
That's no force field; that's a window.

Oh, worms!  I'm always making that mistake.  We birds can be pretty stupid sometimes.

Hi, little bird.  You look thirsty.  Would you like some water?

Don't put it in a glass; he might beat his brains out with it.

Dawn the Dinosaur says to Dilbert, <<<
Let's make a deal.  You let us continue hiding in your house, and Bob won't hungrily devour you.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
That's fair.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But I'm puzzled . . . I know that Dawn can avoid being seen because she is a Nobodysaurus, but how on earth did Bob go unnoticed all this time?

Tennies.

Old dinosaur trick.

Cramp . . .

Maybe a Thesaurus or two . . . Hello?

Dilbert sits at his desk working on his computer and Dogbert watches him.  Dilbert says, <<<
My computer simulation will determine, once and for all, the real reason dinosaurs became extinct.

Wait . . . According to this, it would be almost impossible for ALL dinosaurs to be extinct.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Then they must just be . . .
>>> Dogbert and Dilbert look at each other and say simultaneously, <<<
. . . Hiding.

Yeah?  Just try to find us.

Shhhh!

But by far, the best baked potato I've ever eaten was six years ago . . .

The victim may try sarcasm to relieve the boredom.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Fascinating, now could you think out loud all of the possible dates this may have occurred?

Sarcasm won't work.

Well, it could have been on October 6th . . . Or maybe the 16th.  Was that a Tuesday?

All I have so far is 'Her love was like a wave-division multiplexor.'"  Dogbert says, <<<
Maybe just go for the big finish.

Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dilbert says, <<<
. . . And nature has a way of compensating for weakness.

I guess that also explains why stupid people have big mouths.

I'll always wonder if there was a better way to handle that.

Dilbert says to a salesclerk in a retail clothing store, <<<
I'm looking for a fine wool suit, in the $700 range.  Something fashionable yet timeless.

Try this $35 nylon beauty, suitable for swimming or dining out.  The bell bottoms are no extra charge.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Wow!
>>> Dilbert walks away carrying the $35 suit.  He says, <<<
I guess I was just born to be a fashion pioneer.

No.  At least this one has vowels.

That's 704 for me.
>>>
1989-07-04 * 
Dogbert says to Dilbert, who is wearing a sash and carrying a flashlight, <<<
I still think it's dumb to elect the only known criminal around as leader of the neighborhood crime watch.
>>> Dilbert responds, <<<
Maybe 'Bad Ed' has changed.
>>>  A brick crashes through the window. Dilbert reads the note on the brick and says, <<<
It's from Ed.  'Next meeting: Tuesday at 8:00 P.M.'"  Dogbert says, <<<
I can't wait for the newsletter.

Dogbert and Dilbert stand in the yard.  Dilbert, who is wearing a sash and carrying a flashlight, asks, <<<
Are you sure you don't want to join the neighborhood watch group?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
This is ridiculous.  You all know that every single crime in this neighborhood was committed by one guy: Bad Ed.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
We can't actually prove that.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
I'm just saying maybe you shouldn't have elected him group leader.

Hmm . . . might work.

You may also be interested in my new Velcro chest hair.
>>>
1989-06-30 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk.  Dilbert says, <<<
There . . . My program proves that pretty women have extremely bad personalities.

Darn!  I thought I fixed that bug.

Look, Mr. Death, now that you know I'm the wrong guy, why don't you just leave me alone.

THIS is gonna be a very long day.

. . . Then we film our clients so prospective dates can screen each other for compatibility.
>>> The man continues, <<<
For an extra fee we supply special effects to make you appear more manly.  Our most popluar theme is where we dress you in a loin cloth and you rip the arms off an Arnold Schwarzenegger dummy while bombs explode nearby!
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Gosh, don't you have something that will make me look sensitive and caring?
>>> The man thinks. The man says, <<<
Okay . . . We dress you up as Mary Tyler Moore and have you bottle feeding this plastic dying dolphin.

Step #2: 'The Delivery' (from outside of swatting range).

With anemonies like that, who needs friends?

Dilbert looks into the washing machine and says, <<<
I knew I shouldn't have left the laundry in the washer all night.

I'll get a chisel.

I think this is a sleeve of my sport coat.

Do you want that in a size 38?

Oh, like YOU'VE never had problems with a recipe.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
What happens if my neighbor sues?!
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Did I mention that he was in the Chevy?
>>>
1989-06-19 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair reading the paper.  Dogbert enters wearing a chef's hat and holding a spatula.  Dogbert says, <<<
We're out of flour.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I know.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
And did you know that the bag of white powder in your lab looks just like flour?

Uh . . .

And you know how huge, mutated cupcakes will occasionally eat the neighbor's Chevy?

This better be a bad analogy.

Dilbert shouts, <<<
Dogbert!  Dogbert!  Come here quickly!!

Suppose your eyes were on your ankles; you wouldn't be able to drive a car.

Without cars, dating would be impossible.  No dating, then no marriage.  Soon the species would be extinct.

Grumble, grumble, grumble . . .
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Uh oh!  It looks like Mr. Hedge Clippers wants to speak to Mr. Slippers!
>>> Dogbert hands Dilbert his shreaded slippers. Dogbert says, <<<
Will you be needing your bathrobe too, O Great Master?
>>>
1989-06-10 *

Take a look at my new invention: the 'Dick Tracy' watch!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Wow!  A watch that transmits voices and pictures could revolutionize life on this planet!
>>> Dilbert looks at his watch and says, <<<
Gee, that sounds a lot harder than my idea of gluing a little picture of Dick Tracy on each watch.
>>>
1989-06-09 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I got a chain letter.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Those are illegal.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I've never broken a law in my whole life, but I'm tempted to try this.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
One suggestion.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Maybe for your first crime you shouldn't put your name and address on it and distribute it to ten thousand strangers.
>>>
1989-06-08 * 
Dilbert enters Electrode Hut. Dilbert says to the salesclerk, <<<
I'm looking for a detonator coil, suitable for a small nuclear device.

That was the best one today!
>>>
1989-06-07 * 
Dogbert sits at a desk and says, <<<
The designs for my revolutionary new 'home defense system' are now complete.
>>> Dilbert looks at the plans and says, <<<
Well, this is very detailed.  But where do you think we can find this many 'flying attack porcupines?'
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Just TRY to get a compliment out of that man.
>>>
1989-06-06 * 
Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
Admit it: you don't think I'm manly enough to take sky diving lessons, do you?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
That never crossed my mind.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Good.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
However, it did occur to me that you could be the first sky diver to grab his necktie instead of the ripcord and choke himself to death on the way down.
>>>
1989-06-05 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dilbert says, <<<
Look, Dogbert, give me one good reason why I shouldn't sign up for sky diving lessons.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Thud . . .
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You mean 'thud . . . ouch!' or just 'thud?'
>>>
1989-06-04 * 
Dogbert sits on a pillow by the fireplace.  Dilbert says, <<<
I'll be back late.  I have a date with Sharon to grout her bathtub.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
You call that a date?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Last week you cleaned her rain gutters and painted her house . . . The week before, you installed her sprinkler system and rebuilt her car's engine.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
Don't you think she might be using you?
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Well . . . At least I get lunch out of the deal.
>>> Dogbert asks, <<<
She actually prepares food for you?
>>>  Dilbert carries a bag and a tool box.  He replies, <<<
No, bag lunch.  I get to eat it during break.
>>>
1989-06-03 * 
Dilbert sits at the table reading the newspaper.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Which would you prefer: winning a million bucks or getting hit in the lips with a dead mole while you sleep?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Uh . . . The money.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Well, that's too bad, because you didn't win a million bucks.
>>> Dilbert turns toward the reader and says, <<<
That's the kind of hypothetical question that can keep you up all night.
>>>
1989-06-02 * 
Dogbert sits on his pillow staring at a ball.  Dogbert says, <<<
Sometimes I think the brain holds great powers waiting to be discovered.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
It's almost as if I can make this ball levitate with pure mind power.
>>>  Dogbert concentrates on the ball. Dogbert says, <<<
Dang.  Nothing.
>>>  Behind Dogbert, Dilbert's chair rises into the air and dumps him onto the floor.
>>>
1989-06-01 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk using a screwdriver.  Dogbert says, <<<
You know, dogs can sense earthquakes before they happen.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Here comes one now.
>>>  Dilbert drops the screwdriver. As Dilbert hides under the desk, Dogbert says, <<<
This has potential to keep me entertained for weeks.
>>>
1989-05-31 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk and says, <<<
Wow!  According to my computer simulation, it should be possible to create new life forms from common household chemicals!
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
This raises some thorny issues.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
You mean legal, ethical and religious issues?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I was thinking about parking spaces.
>>>
1989-05-30 * 
Dilbert asks Dogbert who is sitting on the bed, <<<
Do you like my new clip-on necktie?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
It's very nice.  Good colors, nice pattern.  Why, with a tie like that, DON'T be surprised if you get an offer to pose for GQ MAGAZINE!
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I think you crossed that fine line between polite lying and outright sarcasm.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
The momentum carried me.
>>>
1989-05-29 * 
Dogbert holds the telephone and yells, <<<
Dogbert!  The post office is complaining that you attacked a mail carrier.
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Tell them that I love mail carriers and would NEVER try to hurt one.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Apparently they object to the tranquilizer darts and homing transmitters.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
But how else can we learn their migration patterns?
>>>
1989-05-28 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair reading a book and Dogbert sits on his legs.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Why do you waste your time reading books?
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
Because reading increases my knowledge, and knowledge is POWER.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
But power corrupts . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
. . . And corruption is a crime . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
And crime doesn't pay . . .
>>> Dogbert's ears fly up and he says, <<<
If you keep reading, you'll go broke!!!
>>> Dilbert stands up and puts the book on the chair.  He says, <<<
Gosh!  It always seemed so . . . So . . . Harmless.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Oh yeah, the librarians would LOVE to have you believe that!
>>>
1989-05-27 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the table.  Dilbert reads the newspaper and asks, <<<
What do you think about this new Soviet policy of openness?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Actually, I'm not even sure that Gorbachev exists.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Guess I'm just kinda 'glasnostic.'"  Dilbert says, <<<
I shouldn't let you drink coffee.
>>>
1989-05-26 * 
Dilbert walks through a door and thinks, <<<
I hate this: somebody is just far enough behind me that it would be awkward to hold the door, but rude to let it swing.
>>> Dilbert walks away thinking, <<<
I'll just pick up the pace and act like I don't notice anybody behind me.
>>>  The door hits the person behind him. The person screams and falls down the stairs.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
Doors at the tops of stairs are the worst.
>>>
1989-05-25 * 
Dilbert arrives at home and asks, <<<
Okay, where are these so-called upholsterygeist?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
In the living room.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
You turn on the VCR, I'll get the Jane Fonda workout tape!
>>> The chair runs away screaming, <<<
Aaagh!  The Exercist!
>>>
1989-05-24 * 
Dogbert says into the telephone, <<<
I'm sorry to bother you at work, Dilbert, but apparently the furniture has become possessed by mischievous spirits.
>>> The chair and the hassock have faces and clawed feet.  Dogbert says to the chair and hassock, <<<
He wants to know who you guys are.
>>> The chair responds, <<<
Upholsterygeist.
>>>
1989-05-23 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dilbert says, <<<
I had an imaginary friend when I was a kid.
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
But he told me I was boring and he ran away.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
There are times when no snide comment seems adequate.
>>>
1989-05-22 * 
Dilbert shows Dogbert a newspaper advertisement and says, <<<
Imagine my surprise when I saw this ad for Doctor Dilbert's seminar on developing self-confidence.  Okay, what's the scam?
>>> Dogbert explains, <<<
I figured this would be a good way to find a bunch of meek people to do my bidding.  If they refuse, I'll yell at them and hurt their little feelings.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Then I'll leverage that power into vast wealth or maybe world domination.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
No!  Bad doggy!
>>>
1989-05-21 * 
A woman walking down the sidewalk drops something.  Dilbert bends over to pick it up and says, <<<
Excuse me, miss!
>>> The woman turns around and thinks, <<<
Uh oh . . .
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
You dropped this little book titled 'Attractive Women's Secret Guide to Avoiding Dilbert.'
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Wait a minute!  I KNEW there had to be some kind of conspiracy!!
>>> Dilbert opens the book and says, <<<
If I can break this code, it will cripple their entire operation!
>>> The woman shouts into a walkie talkie, <<<
Mayday!!!  Mayday!!!

Dogbert, sic!!!
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Sick?  No, but my nose is a bit dry . . .
>>>
1989-05-20 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert stands on the hassock.  Dilbert says, <<<
Alice brought her new baby to the office today.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
What are you supposed to say when somebody shows you a baby?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
'Precious' usually works.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
Judging from the reaction, 'bug-ugly' wasn't what she was looking for.
>>>
1989-05-19 * 
Dilbert crouches in front of the fireplace stoking the fire.  Dogbert says, <<<
You know what really gripes my wagger?!
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Insensitive humans who say things like 'she's a real dog' or 'he's in the dog house' or 'it's a dog's life.'" Dilbert replies, <<<
Sounds like a pet peeve.
>>>
1989-05-18 *

Regrettably, you violated my air space.
>>>
1989-05-17 * 
Dilbert asks Dogbert, <<<
Notice anything different, Dogbert?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Uh . . .
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I'm wearing THREE pens, not just two.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
That's a pretty bold fashion statement.
>>>  Dilbert replies, <<<
I guess I was out of control.
>>>
1989-05-16 * 
Dogbert says to Dilbert, <<<
I've decided to make some dog friends, but I don't even know what other dogs do when they get together.
>>> Dilbert replies, <<<
Well, I suppose they would bark like idiots, run around in circles, and sniff every part of your body.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
I guess 'Scrabble' is out of the question.
>>>
1989-05-15 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the table.  Dilbert asks, <<<
Well?  What do you think of my new poem?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
I once read that given infinite time, a thousand monkeys with typewriters would eventually write the entire works of Shakespeare.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
But what about MY poem?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Three monkeys, ten minutes.
>>>
1989-05-14 * 
Dilbert stands at the front of a room giving a presentation.  He points to a diagram and says, <<<
. . . And as you can see . . .
>>> Dilbert wiggles his nose and thinks, <<<
Uh oh . . . I got an itch in my nose.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
. . . Can't scratch it now without looking unprofessional.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
Maybe I can casually scratch it with one smooth gesture toward the easel.
>>> Back at home, Dilbert sits in his chair with a bandage on his nose.  Dilbert says, <<<
There's a good chance they thought it was part of the presentation.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
Did the paramedics remove the pointer or just tape over it?
>>>
1989-05-13 * 
Dilbert walks down the hall thinking, <<<
It's so awkward to walk past strangers in hallways; you always gotta avoid eye contact.
>>> Dilbert thinks, <<<
I know - I'll wait until we're near and then pick up that little piece of fuzz on the carpet there.
>>> Dilbert arrives at home with a bandage on his head.  Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
. . . Then we both went for the carpet fuzz.
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
Smooth.
>>>
1989-05-12 * 
Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on Dilbert's legs.  Dogbert asks, <<<
Do you realize that if we stay together for seven years, we are considered married by common law?
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
That means I own half of all your worldly possessions.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
I plan to sell my half . . . Maybe buy some tasteful things instead.
>>>
1989-05-11 * 
Dilbert stands in a computer retail store.  A boy with long hair says, <<<
Welcome to Electrode Hut.  I'm half your age, and I know more about electronics than you ever will.  May I help you?

Or am I bluffing?
>>>  The clerk wrings his hands and thinks, <<<
This guy is GOOD.
>>>
1989-05-10 *

Chapter IV.  'Time Management.'" Dogbert types, <<<
Always postpone meetings with time-wasting morons.
>>>  Dilbert asks, <<<
How do you do that?
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Can I get back to you on that?
>>>
1989-05-09 * 
Dogbert stands on a desk chair typing.  He says to Dilbert, <<<
I'm writing my first business management book, 'Managing in a Bureaucracy.'" Dilbert reads a draft, <<<
You know you're in a bureaucracy when a hundred people who think 'A' get together and compromise on 'B.'" Dilbert asks, <<<
Think anybody will read it?
>>>  Dogbert replies, <<<
It doesn't matter.  The real money is on the lecture circuit.
>>>
1989-05-08 * 
Dogbert walks on a sidewalk.  Someone behind him says, <<<
Uh . . . Excuse me, earth dog.
>>> An alien says to Dogbert, <<<
We have traveled from a distant planet to find out why earth dogs are forced to eat from dirty little bowls while humans use plates.
>>> Dogbert and the aliens sit on the grass.  Dogbert explains, <<<
Well, basically, it's political.  It all began after the unsuccessful poodle rebellion in France, around 1723 . . .
>>>  One alien whispers to the other, <<<
Better use a pencil . . .
>>>
1989-05-07 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert enter a restaurant called <<<

Uh . . . Two please.  Non-smoking.
>>>  The maitre d' replies, <<<
I'm afraid, monsieur, that jackets are required.
>>> The maitre d' says, <<<
You may wear these complimentary house jackets while you dine.
>>> The maitre d' continues, <<<
You must also wear these beaver hats and clown feet.
>>> Dilbert and Dogbert put on the jackets and hats.  The maitre d' says, <<<
Next time messieurs will remember their jackets.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
Looks like we narrowly avoided embarrassment.
>>>
1989-05-06 * 
As he drives his car, Dilbert wonders, <<<
Gee, how could anybody be opposed to building more roads?
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
Every time I see highway construction . . .

End Construction" sign.

. . . I'm afraid my new invention will expose me to lots of lawsuits.

Will you advise me?

No.  Sounds like I can make more money by suing you.
>>>
1989-05-04 * 
Dilbert sits at his desk with paper and a calculator.  Dilbert says, <<<
Ah hah!  Just as I suspected.
>>> Dilbert shows Dogbert a piece of paper and says, <<<
Here it is: mathematical proof that attractive single women exist only in white Volkswagen Rabbits and aerobics classes.
>>>  Dogbert asks, <<<
How do you explain Vanna White?
>>> Dilbert says as he walks away, <<<
I wonder if Isaac Newton had a dog.
>>>  Dogbert adds, <<<
Or a girlfriend.
>>>
1989-05-03 * 
Dilbert says to Phil, <<<
Gee, if you're the ruler of 'Heck' you must have some kind of awesome name.
>>>  Phil replies, <<<
Yeah.
>>> Dilbert asks, <<<
Well, what is it?  Something like 'King of Evil' or 'Lord of Darkness?'" Phil replies, <<<
You can call me Phil, Prince of Insufficient Light.
>>>
1989-05-02 * 
Dilbert says to Phil the Ruler of Heck, <<<
Gosh, I thought 'Heck' was just a figure of speech.
>>>  Phil replies, <<<
Yeah.  A lot of people think they can get away with minor infractions.
>>> Phil says, <<<
According to my records, last month you deliberately asked for THREE little ketchups at McDonald's when you KNEW you only needed TWO.
>>> Dilbert says, <<<
I knew that would come back to haunt me.  Look, I still have the extra one.  I'll give it back!
>>>  Phil shakes his spoon at Dilbert and says, <<<
Shame shame . . .
>>>
1989-05-01 *

Oh good, the last stop of the day.

I can go to hell for drinking old milk?!

Nah, I'm from 'Heck.'  We handle the little stuff.
>>>

Dilbert stands in the yard raking leaves.  Someone shouts, <<<
Hey!  Drop the rake!!

Who are you?

>>> Mother Nature grabs Dilbert by the shirt and shouts, <<<
Are you saying you don't LIKE my housekeeping!!

That's it.  No dinner for you tonight, and I'm sending locusts to eat your house.
>>>
1989-04-29 * 
Dilbert says, <<<
You know what I just realized, Dogbert?
>>> Dilbert continues, <<<
The little hairs on the back of my hand - they never get any longer.
>>> Dogbert says, <<<
Before I respond, just give me a moment to bask in the radiance of your wisdom.
>>>
1989-04-28 *

Time for your sneezing drill.

Other people make it look so natural.

1989-04-26 * 
Dilbert walks down the hall thinking, <<<
Oh no . . . If this guy turns left when I go right, we'll end up walking down the hall right next to each other.
>>> The man turns and walks next to Dilbert.  Dilbert thinks, <<<
I hate this . . . A huge, empty hallway and here we are synchronized like two of the Rockettes.
>>> Back at home, Dilbert tells Dogbert, <<<
. . . So that's when I knocked on the ladies' room door, yelled 'janitor' and ducked inside.
>>>  Dogbert says, <<<
At least you maintained your dignity.
>>>
1989-04-25 * 
Dilbert is getting dressed and Dogbert sits on the bed watching him.  Dilbert holds up a cummerbund and says, <<<
I thought I had this tuxedo thing figured out, but what the heck is this?
>>> Dogbert replies, <<<
Oh, that's the kumberbuzle.  You wear it on your head like a sweatband.
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Then you clip your pens and pencils to the kumberbuzle.
>>>  Dilbert says, <<<
Ah, that explains why the shirt has no pocket.
>>>
1989-04-24 * 
Dilbert stands in front of the mailbox reading an invitation.  Dilbert says, <<<
Great!  The engineer's ball is black tie this year.
>>> Dilbert says to Dogbert, <<<
I will be renting a tuxedo for the ball, and I would like it if you could keep any snide comments to yourself.

Um . . .
>>> Dogbert continues, <<<
Well, I'M Dilbert, and apparently there are some unusual side effects!
>>>  The clerk looks shocked. Dogbert continues, <<<
I took time out from my thriving law practice to come talk to you about it.
>>> Dogbert walks home humming. Dilbert sits in his chair and Dogbert sits on the hassock.  Dilbert says, <<<
Thanks, Dogbert, but I only asked you to get my prescription refill . . . Not the deed to the pharmacy.

In the long run this is more cost-effective.
>>>
1989-04-22 * 
Dilbert and Dogbert sit at the table.  Dogbert says, <<<
I don't quite understand what scientific principle you intend to discover with a bowl of soup and a necktie.

I'm testing the strange attraction between staining liquids and new ties.
>>> The bowl of soup flies across the table and spills on Dilbert's tie.  Dogbert says, <<<

I've decided to dedicate my life to the less fortunate.

That's very noble of you, Dogbert.  Will you be working with the homeless, or perhaps the hungry?

I thought I'd start with people who didn't buy real estate in the 70's . . . Maybe work my way up to that other stuff.
>>>
1989-04-17 *

Like your present model, or one that works?
